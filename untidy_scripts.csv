                    			[Cheery instrumental music.] Mom, Dad, I found cigarettes in Greg's jacket. - Greg, were you smoking cigarettes? - No, Dad. He's lying. There's no doubt about that. Greg, I'm afraid your punishment will be four hours in the snakepit. That'll give you time to think about what you did. Man! That'll teach him. Jan, I'm afraid you've earned a day in the fire chamber for tattling on your brother. Smoking. How does a boy like that go so wrong? - They live in a crummy neighborhood. - The Bradys? Yeah. They got robbers, thugs, drug dealers. You name it. You folks want some pancakes? PETER: No, thanks. See, that's the worst we got is Jemima's Witnesses. LOIS: [Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" [Cheery instrumental music.] MEG: Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections? Meg, you don't need to change the way you look. You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image. [Polka music playing in gym.] [Man and women laughing.] [Growling.] Excellent! The mind-control device is nearing completion! LOIS: Stewie, I said no toys at the table. Damn you, vile woman! You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb. Don't pout, honey. When you were born the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen. But, of course. That was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille! Return the device, woman! No toys, Stewie. Very well, then. Mark my words, when you least expect it, your uppance will come! [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Mom, can I turn the heat up? Don't touch the thermostat, Meg. Your father gets upset. Come on. This thing goes up to 90. Who touched the thermostat? God, how does he always know? Brain implant, Meg. Every father's got one. Tells you when the kids mess with the dial. GUY: My thing went off! Your thermostat okay? - Yeah, it's all right. - Is my kid over here? Forget it! False alarm! BRIAN: Ass ahoy. Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. What's the occasion? He's going to a stag party. Lois, I work hard all week to provide for this family. I am the man of the house. As the man, I order you to give me permission to go to this party. Look, at least promise me you won't drink. Alcohol always leads to trouble. Come on. You're worrying about nothing. Remember when you got drunk off the Communion wine at church? And so the Lord God smote poor Job with festering boils all over his body. Man, I hate it when he tells this story. PRIEST: Yet, miraculously, Job was still able to retain his dignity. - Is that really the blood of Christ? - Yes. Man, that guy must've been wasted And then there was that time at the ice cream store. Butter Rum's my favorite. Remember you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia? [Audience crying.] I got it. That's the guy from Big. Tom Hanks, that's it. Funny guy, Tom Hanks. Everything he says is a stitch. I have AIDS. - Promise me, Peter. - Lois, honey, I promise. Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch these lips tonight. Who wants to play Drink The Beer? Right here. - You win. - All right. What do I win? Another beer! I'm going for the high score! Actually, Charlie's got the high score. Man. Your clock won't flush. I feel kind of bad, guys. I promised my wife I wouldn't drink. - Don't feel bad, Peter. - Gee. I never thought of it like that. Did you bring the porno? Did I bring the porno? You're gonna love it. It's a classic. Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out and you're not on it, you'll regret it. Not today or tomorrow. RICK: But soon, and for the rest of your life. Come on, llsa! Get on it! [Funky music on TV.] NARRATOR: The statue was a gift from France. What is this? Man. My kid must've taped over this for history class. [Groans.] The Statue of Liberty? What are we gonna do? - Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot. - That's just crazy enough to work. Meg, finish your pancakes. - Chris, elbows off your father. - Thanks, son. a great example for the kids, Peter. Yeah. A new family record. Way to raise the bar, Dad. Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that. Kids, Daddy only drank so the Statue of Liberty would take her clothes off. - What did you promise me last night? - I wouldn't drink at the stag party. - And what did you do? - Drank at the stag I almost walked right into that one. God! Feels like accountants are cranking adding machines in my head. [Machines whirring.] Dick, you ever wonder what's outside those walls? That's dangerous thinking, Paul. You best stick to your work. Okay. You see? A hangover is nature's way of telling you I was right. I mean MEG: Mom, are you all right? LOIS: My goodness. This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly? I could've broken my neck. Damn! [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Honey. I took a cab home, I slept on the table so I wouldn't wake you up. Nothing bad happened. I guess you're right. Apology accepted. All right, I'm going to work. Somebody's gotta put food on this table. How are you coming, Johnson? Mr. Weed, I've been working on the new G.I. Jew line. And as you can see, they look great. You call these bagels? I'm glad he's on our side! [Snoring.] MR. WEED: Peter! PETER: What? Are you sleeping on the job? No. There's a bug in my eye and I'm trying to suffocate him. Peter, I like you. But I need you to be more than just eye candy around here. It's your job to watch for toys that could be hazardous to kids. - Now, look sharp! - Yes, sir! [Snoring.] [Foreboding instrumental music.] And now back to Action News 5. Our top story tonight, ""When Toys Attack."" Quite a situation we've got here, Tom. Quite a situation we've got here, Tom, indeed, Diane. The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company of Quahog, Rhode Island has released highly unsafe products into the retail market. Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball! Boy! A Pound Poochie! Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out. Peter, I'm appalled. Your negligence has damaged this company's reputation. You're fired! Jeez. For how long? [Sad instrumental music.] My God! You got fired? - Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine! - How do you know about the machine? PETER: Don't worry. I'll still put food on this table. Just not as much. So it might get a little competitive. Who cares about food? Now we'll never be able to afford my lip injections! BRIAN: Can we put her out in the yard for a while? LOIS: Okay, who's hungry? Jeez. How the hell am I gonna break this to Lois? If she finds out I got fired for drinking, she's gonna blame me! DEVIL: Lie to her. It's okay to lie to women. They're not people like us. I don't know. Hey, where's the other guy? [Cars honking.] Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work. This is perfect! Look, I don't want your mom to worry, all right? When she worries, she says, ""I told you so"" and: ""Stop doing that. I'm asleep."" So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay? Not a word to your mom about me getting canned. LOIS: What's that, Peter? - Nothing. The lost-my-job smells great. - What? Meg, honey, can you pass the fired-my-ass-for-negligence? LOIS: Peter, are you feeling okay? I feel great! I haven't got a job in the world. All right, then let's eat. I know you all hate eggplant, but What on earth was that? What the deuce are you staring at? It's tuna fish and nothing else. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] How's your job search going? It sucks, Brian. I've already been through two jobs this week. I got fired off of that commercial. DIRECTOR: Try it again. PETER: ""I'm caca for Cocoa Puffs."" DIRECTOR: No, damn it! Take 26! Then I had that job as the sneeze guard for that restaurant's salad bar. Take it outside, lady. I thought I could win money in that talent show. EMCEE: And the prize goes to The von Trapp Family Singers! That is bull [Loud applause.] Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent but you might want to tell Lois the truth. What? That I can't provide for my family? That she's always right? That I didn't stand up to a tank in Tiananmen Square? Screw this! I just came over to buy some fireworks! You can't keep lying to her about losing your job. Eventually, she'll find out where you're going every day. Yeah. [Bells and music on TV.] Yeah, you're right. Okay, I'll tell her tonight. [Crickets chirping.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Mellow instrumental music.] Victory is mine! LOIS: I'll need the checkbook in the morning. I'm going to Stop 'N Shop for some sweet corn. You're spending money on food again? Lois, we just had dinner. I enjoyed it so much, I thought we'd eat again tomorrow. Since when are you so concerned about our food budget? I just Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but What is it, Peter? - You're getting kind of fat. - What? It's just It's not healthy. Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape three times a week. When was the last time you saw your toes? I thought you people were supposed to be jolly. Peter, what the hell is the matter with you? Honey, if there's something wrong, you can tell me. - Sorry, man. Am I late? What did I miss? - Thank God you're here. What do I do? Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep. I don't know. Where's the other guy? [Cars honking.] This is unbelievable! I promise you, everything's fine. You got nothing to worry about. STEWIE: Well, well, Mother! We meet again! Stewie, I thought I tucked you in an hour ago. Not tightly enough it would seem. And now you contemptible harpy I shall end your reign of matriarchal tyranny. LOIS: You can play tomorrow, honey. Right now it's bedtime. Blast you and your estrogenical treachery! PETER: Sweet dreams, kiddo. You have the power to end this! How'd she take it? I told her she was fat. No. I hate lying to Lois. It's just It's the best way to keep her from the truth. You have no choice. Your unemployment will dry up soon. She'll probably sense something's amiss when they repossess your house. You really oughta think of your family's welfare. Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea! Okay, do you have any disabilities, past injuries, physical anomalies? I didn't have gas for the first time until I was 30. [Breaks wind.] What the hell was that? PETER: Guys, our money problems are over! We're officially on welfare. Come on, help me scatter car parts on the front lawn. How much are we getting? Let's see. $150 a week. Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal. [Uplifting instrumental music.] Whoops. No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon. I was giving a piano lesson. Stewie, why don't you play in the other room? Why don't you burn in hell? No dessert for you, young man. Who would've thought getting drunk would get me $150,000 a week from the government? This is why I don't vote. Maybe somebody down there was drinking, too. Mr. President, why do you think the public supports you during these impeachment proceedings? Probably because you're so fat. Peter, you might want to call the Welfare Commission. That check is obviously an oversight. Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like their one millionth customer. BRIAN: What? You're gonna spend $150,000 a week? - Yeah. - On what? LOIS: Oh, my God! Peter, you bought the statue of David? No. I just rented it. But they're gonna be ticked. The penis broke off while I was loading it into the car. I shall call you ""Eduardo."" Peter, how can we afford this? You won't believe it, Mom! Dad's getting A big raise! Peter, that's wonderful! But, Dad, I thought The kind of raise that'll allow me to give my kids a big allowance just for keeping their big mouths shut. Come on, guys. I'll buy us the most expensive meal we've ever had. Yeah. I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please. CLERK: I beg your pardon? And a ""So-sage"" McBiscuit, please. Peter, what's the big surprise? You know how I always said you should be treated like a queen? I got you your own jester. JESTER: Good to be here in New England. And what's the deal with ""New"" England anyway? It's over 200 years old! Last time I checked, that's not that new. This is great. I can finally afford to give my little girl the lips she's always dreamed of. MEG: Thank you, Daddy! [Kisses Peter.] I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing. But did you have to buy breast implants for Chris? It makes him happy. These are cool. MAILWOMAN: When did you get a pool? It's a moat. I know it's silly but my husband thinks our family needs extra protection now that we're rich. Does it work? It does keep the Black Knight at bay. [Horse sputtering.] Congratulations in all your success. Here's your welfare check. What the [Foghorn blowing.] Hi, honey. What? PETER: I know what I did was wrong. But I only did it for you and the kids. Except for the jukebox in the bathroom. That was for Peter. Yeah, from the American taxpayers. I am so mad I can't see straight. No problem. We got money to get that fixed with enough left for us to buy our way out of any trouble our kids might get into. Just like the Kennedys. LOIS: I feel like I don't even know you anymore, Peter. The man I married would never think he could fix a problem just by spending money! Boy, she's pretty pissed. Who thought fraud would be one of her buttons? Why have a jukebox in the john if your wife's mad at you? Peter, you may have to return that money to the taxpayers. But I gotta make sure Lois knows I'm doing it. I need an event with thousands of people. Something that everybody cares about. We might have to leave Rhode Island for this. ANNOUNCER: The air is electric here at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight! Pat, it's safe to say that all these fans came out here to watch a game of football! John, we're in commercial. Yeah, I know. I'm just making conversation. Come on. Football! Amazing. You can barely drive a car. Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp? Yeah, America's great, isn't it? Except for the South. Boy, I hope Lois is watching. Okay, taxpayers, here you go! PAT: Looks like we're getting some rain here tonight, John. Yeah. Hey, wait a second! This is no ordinary rain! It's some kind of crazy money rain! I'm being told it's a man and his dog throwing cash out of a blimp. Man. I hope this works. Otherwise, I'm gonna have to start dropping these. [People cheering.] JOHN: The crowd is storming the field! This is pandemonium! Have you ever seen anything like this, Pat? Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl. This is the old ""trying to make amends ""for spending $150,000 a week in misappropriated welfare funds"" play. I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining a perfectly good game of football! - Madden to Fox Security. - Go ahead. JOHN: Take them down! GUARD: Yes, sir. How was your shower? I tell you, all of the rumors about dropping the soap are true. Really? You can't hold onto that thing to save your life. It was slipping everywhere. Guys were laughing. GUY: There's the guy that couldn't hold the soap. That was classic. Boy. I really let Lois down this time. Do you think she'll wait for me? If every woman dumped her husband for crashing a blimp, no one would be married. Yeah, you're right. Okay, I got the top bunk. My collagen is wearing off. Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way of telling you you shouldn't cover for your father's lie. What does it mean when your armpits cry stinky tears? It means you're becoming a man. But hopefully not the kind who stays out all day and doesn't call like your father who shall remain nameless. STEWIE: Hello, Mother. LOIS: Hi there, sweetie. You know, Mother, life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get. Your life, however, is more like a box of active grenades! [Dramatic instrumental music.] STEWIE: Now, I offer one last chance for deliverance. Return my mind-control device or be destroyed. You just want your toy back. Okay, here you go, honey. Yes Well, victory is mine! [Explosion.] STEWIE: Damn you all! [Phone ringing.] [Phone ringing.] Hello? Oh, my God! Lois, am I glad to see you. I have nothing to say to you, Peter. I gave the money back. Why are you still steamed? Peter, you lied to me, you betrayed my trust. Compared to that, welfare fraud doesn't even matter. Really? Let's hope the judge feels that way. This court will come to order. I figured the sooner I cashed the check the sooner they'd catch their mistake. Why are we making a federal case out of this? Don't you think you should have alerted the government of such a gross overpayment? I was gonna call them. But my favorite episode of Different Strokes was on. The one where Arnold and Dudley get sexually molested by the bike shop owner? All right. Now I want you boys to scream real loud at my ass. And everybody learns a valuable lesson. Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson? Yes. Stay the hell away from that bike shop. [People murmuring.] Okay, everybody, I feel really bad about what I did. I just I don't know. I saw the one chance l'd ever have to give my family the things they deserve. I guess I screwed it up. I cheated the government. And worst of all, I lied to my wife. And she deserves better. I'm sorry, honey. Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison. No! - No! - No! No! Yeah! [Rock music.] [Rock music stops abruptly.] LOIS: Excuse me, Your Honor? JUDGE: Yes? Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times. He may even be downright stupid. But I know he only accepted that money because he wanted to be a good husband and father. But what he needs to remember is that we love him. And no matter what, I'll always stand by him. I love you too, honey. That was very moving, Mrs. Griffin. Okay, you can go to jail with him! What? Intolerable as it may be l'm completely dependent upon those wretched drones for sustenance. Let us see how the constitution of American justice fares against the device! [Device pulsates.] Is that your boy? What? Yeah. That's Stewie. Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young from his father. It's unjudgmenly. - Hell, you've learned your lesson, right? - Yeah. - All right. You're free. - Wow! Can you give me my job back? No. - Yes. - All right! [Cheery instrumental music.] [Man laughing on TV.] ED: That was a crazy one, Dick. DICK: It sure was. In this next blooper from Joanie Loves Chachi watch what happens when Scott Baio tries to say: ""She sells seashells down by the seashore."" What does your mom do? She sells seashells down by the That is kind of a tongue twister. It's good to have you home, Peter. Honey, I knew everything would turn out okay. I sure am gonna miss being rich. PETER: Don't worry. I got a way to get money. Not another welfare scam? No. Minority scholarship. [Giggles.] [Jazzy instrumental music.] LOIS AND BRIAN: No. STEWIE: Are you insane? Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit. [Giggles.] BRIAN: No. LOIS: Don't think so. STEWIE: Absolutely outrageous. Okay, disability claim. [Theme music.]"

                    			[Cheery instrumental music.] LOIS: Look at Stewie. Isn't he adorable playing with his Sesame Street phone? Put me through to the Pentagon. ERNIE: What sound does a cow make? STEWIE: Don't toy with me! I've already dispatched with Mr. Hooper. I've six armed men outside Big Bird's nest. And as for Linda? It's difficult for a deaf woman to hear an assassin approach, isn't it? ERNIE: Can you count to three? STEWIE: Indeed I can. One! Two! Three! Can I count to three? For God's sake, I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level. LOIS: [Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" Come on, Stewie. You can't leave the table until you finish your vegetables. Then I shall sit here until one of us expires. You've got a good 40 years on me, woman! Sweetie, it's broccoli. It's good for you. Now open up for the airplane. [Makes airplane noise.] Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you! And damn the Wright Brothers! My, aren't we fussy tonight. Okay. No broccoli. Very well then. L Who the hell do you think you are? Honey, it's not gonna go away just because you don't like it. Well, then. My goal becomes clear. The broccoli must die. [Sinister instrumental music.] Mom, will you take me out to practice driving? I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour. Maybe your father can take you. Sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you. But Daddy also loves Star Trek. And, in all fairness, Star Trek was here first. KIRK: Captain's log, Stardate 8169.7. The Enterprise has just discovered a strange new planet in the Gamma Faloppia star system. Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9. LOIS: For God's sake, Peter. You've been in front of the TV since you got home from work. Why don't you spend some time with your family? I will, during the commercials. And if that's wrong, maybe I'm missing the point of having commercials. [Sighs.] Please. My road test is tomorrow and you haven't taught me anything. You may want to find a better teacher than Peter. What are you talking about? I'm a great driver. Remember your trip to the Southwest? [Road Runner meep-meeping.] - Jeez. Did I just hit that ostrich? - No. - Are you sure? - He's fine. Keep going. Don't believe that. I always keep my eyes on the road. PETER: I don't miss a thing. TV: We now return to Star Trek. Holy crap. Uhura's black? All right, Meg. Now here's your first lesson. You always want to be aware of other cars on the road. If you catch eyes with the guy next to you at a red light, you gotta race him. - This guy's asking for it. - But Dad I don't make the rules, honey. Now rev your engine twice. Okay. [Engine revving twice.] [Horse sputtering twice.] Go! [Fast-paced instrumental music.] [Screaming.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] PETER: You forgot to flip him off. But other than that, nice job. You're back already? That wasn't much of a lesson. I didn't want to overload her on her first time out. Besides CHiPs is about to start. So let's sit back and get lost in a world of California Highway Patrol fantasy! [Police siren.] [Funky instrumental music.] - What's the charge, Officer? - Driving without my phone number. [Gunshots firing.] Or maybe I should arrest you for being too beautiful. [Teeth sparkling.] So, broccoli, Mother says you're very good for me. I'm afraid I'm no good for you! The first rule of war is know thine enemy. And I know this! Cold kills broccoli! It's so simple. All I need to do is build a machine to control the global environment. Forecast for tomorrow, a few sprinkles of genius with a chance of doom! [Sinister instrumental music.] PETER: This is taking forever! Come on. Let's go. Fox is running one of those new reality shows at 8:00. Fast Animals, Slow Children. [African instrumental music.] Come on, guys. Wait up. [African music continues.] Dang. I got honey all over my legs. Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life depends on getting my license. If I can't drive, I'll never have a boyfriend, never get married and then I'll have to adopt a kid like Rosie O'Donnell. Are you implying that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive? I'm so nervous. You're gonna do great. Remember everything I taught you. - Let's start by going down Main Street. - Okay. [Engine revving twice.] [Police siren.] - What are you doing? - I'm driving. [Screaming.] Are you gonna mark me down for not flipping him off? God, my life is over. I am the biggest loser I know! I know how you feel, pumpkin. I've had my share of disappointments, too. DOCTOR: It's a girl! Can you check again? You just have to remember that life has its little ups and Jeez! We're gonna miss the beginning of my show. There it is. MEG: Dad, watch out! [Horn blaring.] PETER: Meg, honey, are you okay? MEG: Yeah, I think so. PETER: The Quahog Cable Television Transmitter. [Citizens grumbling.] You just knocked out cable TV for the whole town! Boy! Look. There's Bigfoot! Whoa. This isn't about me. This is about you. At least I bought us some time. - She did it. - What? Dad, you were the one driving! I was teaching her to drive and she lost control of the car. Come on, we all did stupid stuff when we were kids, right? I remember when I tried to sneak into an R-rated movie. - Come on. Give the kid a break, huh? - Why should we? She got her arm shot off in Vietnam. [Murmuring.] GUY: Poor kid. MAN: What a senseless war. I can't believe you just sold out your own daughter. I know what I did was wrong. And I know it's not the first time I've embarrassed you. And if you add the measure of the angles of a right triangle, the sum Meg, clean out the shower the next time you shave your legs. It's like a carpet in there. I hate to see you so upset. I know. Let's play a little game called Taking the Fall for Daddy. If you win, I'll buy you a convertible when you get your license. Really? Daddy! Now I love you again! You're gonna make some Jewish guy a great wife. [Metallic clanking.] Because of an accident at the Quahog Cable Company television transmission will be out for an undetermined amount of time. Of course, no one can see this news program so it doesn't really matter what we say. I'm the Lord Jesus Christ. Think I'll go get drunk and beat up midgets. How about you? Tom, I just plain don't like black people. You guys, we're still on in Boston. Excellent. The weather machine is nearly completed. What do you say to that, broccoli? Stop mocking me! What's this? It appears the witless provider has finally brought me something of value. I can use that crude device to amplify my deadly signal. Victory shall yet be mine. Guess what, Mom? Dad crashed the car into the city cable transmitter. - What? - It's okay. If I take the blame, he'll buy me a convertible when I get my license. Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame if you go around telling everyone. Peter, you're bribing your daughter with a car? Come on, Lois. Isn't ""bribe"" just another word for ""love""? You wanted me and Meg to bond. That's what we're doing. CHRIS: Dad, I was in a chat room on America Online and Doomie 22 told me some idiot knocked out the cable. We could be without TV for weeks! Now, Chris, now let's not panic. We can manage just fine without TV. [Brian scoffs.] - What's that supposed to mean? - Face it, you're addicted to television. You're not exactly Mr. Cold Turkey. Remember when you gave up candy? I'll ask you one more time. You didn't eat anything in my factory? No. - I'm just asking - Are you calling me a liar? - I'm just saying - Shut up, Wonka. Yeah. That was different. I'll be fine. - Are you sure, honey? - For God's sake, you guys. You think I'm some simp who can't live without TV? Give me a break. - What's happening now? - Sipowicz is finding who stabbed the super. Are you gonna tell me, or am I gonna have to show you my ass? I ain't saying nothing! All right, it was Jimmy the Hat! Forget it, Mike. Without actually seeing his ass, this is just radio. Class, we were scheduled to watch a PBS program on the mating rituals of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe of New Guinea. Unfortunately, Megan Griffin ruined TV. So instead, we're having a surprise test. WONDER YEARS VOICE: Suddenly I was public enemy number one. It was time to tell the truth. Wait! I didn't drive into the satellite dish! And who did? WONDER YEARS VOICE: I was just a 15-year-old girl. But at that moment, I realized I had a whole lifetime to make new friends. But only one chance to get a new car. And I had to take it. Okay, I did it. PETER: I don't know how much longer I can last. It's been a whole week since I seen a TV show. I wonder what Scooby and the gang are up to now. NARRATOR: We now return to The Scooby Doo Murder Files. Gee whiz, gang. The killer gutted the victim, strangled him with his own intestines and then dumped the body in the river! - Jinkies! What a mystery! [Moaning.] You're right, Scoob. We're dealing with one sick son of a bitch. You just need to find something to fill the void that's left in your life. Lois has knitting, Chris has video games, Meg's learning how to drive. And me, I like the sauce. Whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here? [Moaning.] Can't live without TV. Must see TV. [Frightful instrumental music.] [Whimsical instrumental music.] [Sinister instrumental music.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Sighs.] Stewie, I expect you to finish off your vegetables. Rest assured, you relentless harridan, I expect I shall finish them all off! And you as well! Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter. Last night I woke up and he was channel surfing through static. I'm sure he'll find a way to cope. - Morning, Lois. - And you were worried. - Peter, what the hell is that? - It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins. Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning to think you're losing your grip on reality. PETER: Boring. I'll go see what else is on. LOIS: Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie. Don't move! [Making ridiculous noises.] [Screams.] STEWIE: A little help? PETER: It's Glen Quagmire, the wacky next-door neighbor. PETER: What's he up to this time? QUAGMIRE: I'm going to work! Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes. We have to find your father, Chris. He's not well. I never knew anyone who went crazy before except my invisible friend Col. Schwartz! I get all the channels on this thing. Lifetime. CBS. Hey, UPN. All right. 90210. - Dad? - Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly? They're really reaching for guest stars in the 10th season. Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here! I'm already a total outcast because of you! You're just upset because you wrecked the cable transmitter. I did not! Forget it. What good is a car if I have no friends? I didn't wreck TV! My dad did! - What? - What'd she say? - Peter Griffin ruined TV? - And blamed his daughter? That's the lowest thing I've ever heard. Peter, take that thing off and come home. Hey, Lois. You're just in time for the exciting conclusion. Looks like some boob's about to get lynched. Let's watch. There they are. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] That's the guy who ruined our cable. Let's get him! Stop! What is wrong with you people? Okay, yes. My husband is responsible for knocking out TV. But we should be thanking him. He's broken television's hypnotic spell over us. Now we can see the world for what it is a beautiful place full of wonderful things just waiting to be experienced. Another chick flick. She's right. All the hours we've wasted on that damn idiot box. - I'm gonna paint my house! - I'll build a ship in a bottle. I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick down a dirt road. LOIS: I'll take you home, honey. I can't believe I let Meg take the blame. You were right, Lois. TV is evil. I hear that Manson guy watches it in jail all day long. If I haven't seen it, it's new to me. You just went a little overboard. You need a little balance in your life. There are other things to appreciate besides television. - You mean like this lamp? - Yeah. Okay. - The lamp gives us light. - I get it. And your family gives you love. You should spend some time with our kids, Peter. And with me. What could me and you do together? [Naughty laugh.] Lois! You've got a sick mind! Peter, I'm talking about making love. I thought you wanted us to murder the children and harvest their organs for beer money. [Amorous giggling.] What a gorgeous day. Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun? It's always a nice day with two scoops of raisins, Peter. [Car alarm blaring.] - Top of the morning, everybody. - Excellent! Thus completes the penultimate adjustment to my weather control device! Victory is Release me at once! Your mother was right. It'd be a crime to sit around and wait for the TV. - Great. You can teach me how to drive. - There'll be time to drive when you're dead. There's a world out there waiting for us to grab it by the short hairs! - Damn! - Let's go. [Cheery instrumental music.] I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing really wore me out. Wake up! You promised you'd get this hook out of my mouth. [Screams.] Thank you. Now, kids, your father's just trying to spend time with his family. Or kill us. I'm not sure which. TOM: The Chinese sure like to spit, don't they? Diane, that last report was so good, I think you deserve a spanking. I don't think your wife would appreciate that. That frigid old cow lives in Quahog. She can't hear a word I'm saying. Actually, we're back on the air in Quahog. STEWIE: Thank God! Their puerile minds are once again distracted by that flickering box. Time to be bad! PETER: Come on, everyone. We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival. You know those Germans. You don't join their party, they come get you. But Dad, the TV's back on. What do you know? Okay, let's go. Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend so much time with the family. But we're exhausted. Maybe we could just sit and watch some TV together? We're too busy living life to the fullest. Come on, let's go. - I'm sick of life. - Yeah. My dogs are barking. - But I thought we were having fun. - We were. But now it might be nice to watch other people have fun or get killed. - You know, whatever's on. - Look, Peter. It's your favorite show. This is a dangerous mission. And it's likely one of us will be killed. The landing party will consist of myself, Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey. Crap. Sorry, Lois. There's only one show I want to see. It's called Make Every Day Count, starring Peter Griffin as himself. LOIS: Come on, Peter. Don't you miss TV just a little? The familiar stories, the broadly drawn characters, the convenient plot turns that bring a character around at exactly the right moment? Hi. I'm William Shatner. My car broke down on my way to give a speech on how TV keeps families together. Would you like to hear it? No, I don't want to miss the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar. Wait a minute! I love schnitzel! Come along. I bet you could squeeze into Lois' lederhosen. I'll change in the car. If I had a nickel for every time one of my parents walked out instead of teaching me how to drive, I'd be one rich little Let's go, Meg. [Sinister instrumental music.] Fare thee well, broccoli! [Band playing German folk music.] I don't know. I can't imagine choosing life over television. I'm telling you, it's great, Bill. The only thing that would make this perfect day better is if my family was here. My God! It was sunny a moment ago, but now it's pouring! Let's take off our shoes and run home barefoot! Griffin, you're a madman! Barefoot, you say? LOIS: This is not safe. I'll teach you how to drive some other time. Pull over. Mom, I can't even tell where ""over"" is. [Giddy laughter.] You were right, Peter. I've never felt so alive. Victory is mine! [Screams.] STEWIE: God damn it. [Giddy laughter.] My God. [Car colliding.] My God. I hit William Shatner. Light growing dimmer. Can't breathe. Beam me up, God. I did not see that coming. Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over and killed Mr. Shatner. Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast, I'll do enough living for me and Bill. Honey, can't we go back to the way things used to be? There's a big dent in that couch that nobody else can fill. Haven't you guys learned anything? TV took over my life once. I'm never gonna let that happen again. My God. We've lost him. If you help me out of here, I know a meadow where the blueberries are begging to be picked. Look, buddy. Just go in the pan. And don't call me unless you're flatlining. PETER: Turn that TV off. Nurse? ANNOUNCER: What would you do for a Klondike Bar? ANNOUNCER: Would you stand on one leg? MAN: Sure. ANNOUNCER: Would you act like a monkey? ANNOUNCER: Would you kill a man? [Gunshot.] Daddy, now that I've finally passed my driver's test can I still get a convertible? No. But I'm proud of you for getting your license, sweetheart. And I'm proud of you, Peter. You taught us all a valuable lesson. It's not what you do that defines the quality of your life it's who you do it with, and your family It's on. I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie, but you'll thank me when you grow up big and strong like your father. A compelling argument. You've swayed me, woman. That is good. I feel stronger already. It's good tasting and good for you. Nice try. - Quadruped. - Mutant. [Theme music.]"

                    			LOIS: [Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" [Cheery instrumental music.] LOIS: Everything's all set for Stewie's birthday party. I can't believe he's almost a year old. Yeah. I'll never forget the day he was born. DOCTOR: One more push, Lois. DOCTOR: This is a miracle, Mr. Griffin. Would you like to see? PETER: Yeah, I've never actually seen a baby being Oh, God! DOCTOR: Congratulations. It's a boy. DOCTOR: Wait a minute. I don't think we're through. Oh, my God! Is it twins? DOCTOR: No. It's a map of Europe. [Sinister instrumental music.] I confirmed everything with the birthday party planner at Cheesie Charlie's. - Why Cheesie Charlie's? - It's cool, Dad. They have this game where you put in a dollar and you win four quarters! I win every time! I get to go, right? Why can't we have the same kind of party we always do? Peter, this could be our last first birthday ever. When Meg and Chris turned one, I had so much to do, I missed everything. [Kids chattering.] [Sighs.] PETER: Lois, you won't believe this! Meg just said ""Da-Da!"" Her first words? Then she stood up by herself and started walking! - Her first steps? - Yeah. What the hell are you doing in here anyway? [Drums playing.] PETER: All right! Her first drum solo. [Applause.] Thanks to Cheesie Charlie l'm not gonna miss a moment of Stewie's party. I say, am I to spend the entire day wallowing around in my own feces? A little service here! Hey, Stinky. Have we got some big plans for you. Plans? What the devil are you talking about? It's your birthday, dude. Saturday's gonna be real special, honey. I've hired a professional to make sure everything goes just right. A professional? There's treachery afoot! [Crying.] Meg, you're home late. I stayed after school to try out for cheerleading. Don't keep me in suspense. How'd you do? I'll give you a hint. I S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked! Yay! I mean, sorry, honey. MEG: God, I hate high school. I don't fit in with anyone. Boy. Do I know that feeling. [Suspenseful, jazzy instrumental music.] Okay, man. Okay. You are really throwing me off. It's step-kick, step-twirl. Got it? I thought we were gonna rumble with those greasy Sharks. Not without seven years of ballet and two of jazz tap, we're not. From the top, people! Why don't you just hang back and stretch? I don't get it. The more I try to make friends, the more people hate me. Listen. You're a one-of-a-kind girl with a mind of her own. - Now, see, that's what people hate. - Really? I'm telling you, just be the girl you think everyone else wants you to be. Wow, it's so obvious. Thanks, Daddy. MEG: Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom. LOIS: I haven't seen Meg this happy since that bus broke down in front of our house. Hi. Can we use your phone? Holy crap! It's The Children of the Corn! - Meg and I had a little father-daughter talk. - It seems to have worked. I wasn't just blowing smoke when I bought this T-shirt. Well, you're the number-one husband, too. I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt. STEWIE: ""Dear Diary ""It seems the domestic overseers are plotting against me. ""Their plans somehow relate to the anniversary of my escape from the womb. ""I'm still haunted by the memories of how I was incarcerated ""in that amniotic Attica. [Epic instrumental music.] ""As I recall, it was every potential man for himself. [Whooshing.] ""I alone had reached the target objective, thanks to the intrepidity ""I developed at testicular boot camp. But it was a trap! ""I was imprisoned in that uterine gulag for nine grueling months."" Day 171. I've sprouted another finger, counting the one from yesterday. I'm up to 11. ""As the months of solitude passed, I began to go insane. ""It seemed my prison cell was getting smaller and smaller. ""I was quite sure that soon I would be dead. ""But then, a miracle! There was a light at the end of the tunnel. ""I rushed to freedom, but suddenly I was ambushed by a mysterious man in white!"" The man in white. Of course. He must be the hired professional of whom they spoke. He failed to thwart my escape into the outside world. And now, one year hence, he's returning to rectify his mistake and put me back in the womb! [Dramatic instrumental music.] Boy, it sure is great being thin and popular. GIRL 1: Let's throw up. GIRL 2: Sure! GIRL 3: Good idea! I love throwing up. [Laughing.] [Sighs.] Hi. I'm Jennifer. I'm Meg. My God. Your hair is so beautiful. I just want to brush it. Really? You want to go throw up? [Western instrumental music.] Hey, Dad, let's go whack some moles! Now, Chris, we're not here for fun. [Children giggling.] Now your mom is counting on us to drop off the deposit. So let's just deliver the check and PETER: Hong Kong Phooey! Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat my dust! PETER: Come on, move it! Oh, man! Chris, this place is great. Pull over, you bastard! Pull over, you bastard! Man. CHRIS: Hey, Dad, they even got games in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon! Yeah, way to go, Chris. Where's my watch? All right. I won a watch. What's The Dukes of Hazzard? That's mine. Come on. Come on, give that back! - Give it! - Come on! UNCLE JESSE: Folks in Hazzard County hadn't seen a watch fight in a long time. Them boys rassled for a full five minutes before the manager stepped in. Come on! Hands off, fatty! Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. I'm a paying customer. I got a deposit check for my kid's party right here. Mr. Griffin. I am terribly sorry. We're really looking forward to Stewie's special day. Now I don't know, after the emotional trauma I've endured on your premises, I think I deserve a little discount. Sir, our prices are set by the corporate office. Then maybe I'll just take my business elsewhere. Good luck filling our spot by this Saturday. MAN: I got cash! WOMAN: I'll take it! Suit yourself. Wait. I was just bluffing. My wife has her heart set on this place. [Peter yells after him.] Chris, this is a big day for you. The day you become the man of the house. Because when we get home, your mother is going to kill me. So the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb, is he? If I'm to defeat him, I shall require professional forces. STEWIE: Here we are. ""Come to Managua, the Mecca of mercenaries."" I must prepare for my journey. Let's see. Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios - So, are we all set at Cheesie Charlie's? - Actually, I canceled the reservation. What? - How could you? - Lois, I got a very good reason. Wait a second. These are always classic. Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good. See, it happened like this. [Spooky instrumental music.] [Screaming.] Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's. Heil, Hitler! Actually, the name's Griffin. I was sent by my smart, beautiful, and still sexually appealing wife, Lois. Yes. We're all set for your little boy's party. I understand we're getting a terrific bargain here. Absolutely. The children get to play our games. And if they win enough tickets, they get a prize. I have 13 tickets now. Is that enough? Sorry, Timmy. But you need 15 tickets to live. [Screaming.] They also get food, cake, and your choice of ice-cream flavors vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people. - What was that? - Chocolate. Give me the check. Hold it! Lois may have had her heart set on this place but I love my family too much to risk their lives. - Come on, Chris. We're leaving. - No, you're not! Please don't make me angry, pal. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. [Eerie instrumental music.] LOIS: All right, Peter. That's enough! Bravo, Peter. You are the Spalding Gray of crap. Do you know how hard it was to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's? I had to book it the day of my ultrasound. We'll never find another place in time! For once, it was all gonna be so perfect! Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect. We'll give him the best birthday ever right here in the safety and comfort of our own home. - Peter, we've been over this. - Honey, you won't have to lift a finger. I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo, a big-ass piñata, the works! - You got all those things? - You bet I did. LOIS: Wow. Even Cheesie Charlie's doesn't have a petting zoo. Okay, I'll call the parents and let them know the party's here. - You don't have any of those things. - How do you know? Face it. You're a terrible liar. [Sniffing.] It was you. Clowns and petting zoos book months in advance. You're gonna have a tough time finding a Hold on. DRIVER: Ya! Ya! [Horses neighing.] Some day. Hey there, little boy. Are you lost? STEWIE: Now, listen to me, Jolene. I've got an army to raise, and I must get to Nicaragua. I require a window seat and an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles! - God help you if I find pickles. - Henry, I have a lost little boy. Hey there, little fella. Why don't you come with me? STEWIE: Damn you! You're one of them, aren't you? What are they paying you? I'll double it! I'll give you whatever you want! Money! Women! Men? Dad, what are we doing here again? Pigs, Chris. We're getting pigs for Stewie's petting zoo. [Blower starting.] [Pig squealing.] [Pigs squealing.] [Motor stopping.] Crafty swine. UPS. Little bastards ain't as smart as Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer. She gave me a ride home. Meg, you made a friend. JENNIFER: What a lovely house, Mrs. G. Meg, you didn't tell me your mother was just like Martha Stewart. Oh, no. Once you get to know me, I'm really very nice. You know what's nice? Having a friend like Meg. And kittens. It was super swell meeting you. Bye, Meg. Friends forever. Forever and ever. [Giddy laughter.] Wow! What a great yard! Guess what, Mom? Jennifer invited me to a party on Saturday. This Saturday? Meg, you can't miss Stewie's first birthday. MEG: But Mom Meg, our entire family is going to be here for Stewie's party. And that includes you. Understood? I can't believe you'd put your family before your own daughter! She's a whiny little runt, isn't she? I said ""runt."" I don't think I'm in the right place. I'm looking for a guy to entertain the kids at my son's birthday. Sure. I can do that. You do children's parties? Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand, and some somersaults maybe. I can make pretend like the children are little bugs in my web. Do you know your phone number, son? The only way you'll get me to talk is through slow, painful torture. And I don't think you've got the grapes! It sounds like you don't want to go home. Are you running away? Stewart Gilligan Griffin runs from nothing! You know, son, running away never solves anything. You're getting to be a big boy now. And part of growing up means facing your problems head on. The ruptured capillaries in your nose belie the clarity of your wisdom. You're saying I must return to face this man in white myself. So be it. As for you, kind sage, I only hope my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm as you spend the next 10 years in frozen carbonite! Peter, you've only got a couple of hours left. If you pull a party out of your ass, you'll want to stand up. My friend Jennifer invited me to hang out with her friends. Can I go? I won't fall for this trick. Did you ask your mother? Yes. Okay, then. Have fun, sweetheart. Thanks, Daddy! Brian, Stewie's birthday is gonna suck. The only stuff I could get on such short notice was a cake and that big-ass piñata. I sure hope candy comes out of that. Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father, a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser. I'll never be able to face Lois. The circus is in town. Maybe you could run away and join it. The circus! [Marching band playing.] [Elephant trumpeting.] Hi. This is the right day, isn't it? Oh, yes. Peter should be back any minute and then we can start the party, I hope. Hey, Lois, look. The two symbols of the Republican party an elephant and a big fat white guy who's threatened by change. LOIS: Peter, this is the most wonderful celebration I could have imagined. PETER: Yeah. Where's Stewie? He's upstairs, resting up for his big day. [Oriental instrumental music.] I'll get him. If you see Meg, tell her to take plenty of pictures. Meg's not here. She went to a friend's house. What? She's gonna miss Stewie's birthday. I dropped her off an hour ago. Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what? Peter. How could you let her go? What's the big deal? So Meg's with her new friends. They seemed like some nice kids. JENNIFER: I'm glad you could join us. We're gonna have a great time on our trip. A trip? Like to the beach? Because I didn't bring my swimsuit. You won't need anything where we're going. Excuse me. I've gotta go mix the punch. [Whimsical music playing.] [Whimsical music playing.] CHRIS: Birthday dude? Do you want some ice cream? Yes. But no sprinkles! For every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you! Come on, Lois. I hate to see you so upset. We got animals. We got clowns. I mean, a party couldn't be any better if Jesus himself showed up. Okay, everybody. For my next miracle, I'm gonna turn water into funk. [Disco music playing.] Peter, the circus is terrific. But it's not just Stewie's birthday. We're also celebrating the day our family became whole. Today means nothing if Meg isn't here. Meg, you seem sad. Today's a happy day. I know. It's just that I really like that guy over there. But he doesn't even know I exist. He must think I'm a total dog. That is so not true. Then what is it? - He's a eunuch. - Really? Sure. All the guys here have been castrated. It's cool. - Do you think that girl is hot? - No. Me neither. [Elephant trumpeting.] Hey, you. Hit me. There. Now, if I can just find a midget with some gin, I'll be in business. Where are you off to? I gotta make things right for Lois and get this monkey off my back. PETER: Ow! Knock it off! All right, men, the man in white is coming to put me back in the womb. Today he comes for me, but tomorrow it could be you or you! I offer you the opportunity to join me in glorious battle. I know that for some of you, your motor skills are not developed. Sadly, you will be used as decoys. Sadly, you will be used as decoys. But your children's children will know that you fell for a noble cause. Now, who's with me? Duckie? Useless, every one of you! Fine. I'll defend myself, and the hell with all of you! There, I've gone and soiled myself. Are you happy now? [Gong goes off.] Our leader is here to take us on our journey! My children, rejoice. The hour of transformation is close at hand. Who are you? This is Meg, wise one. Can she come with us? Perhaps. Do you have a mind that seeks enlightenment and a heart that seeks purity? Not really. Okay. Are you a confused adolescent desperately seeking acceptance from an undifferentiated ego mass that demands conformity? Wow, that sort of sounds more like me. Great! Then all you need is a dark-blue jogging suit. Let's see what we have in stock. What are you? About a 9? No. A 6. Right. Dispense the refreshments. Meg, there you are. Dad, what are you doing here? I'm so embarrassed, I could die! GUY: Not before the rest of us! Meg, your mother wants the family together today. It's just Stewie's birthday. So what if I'm not there? Who's gonna remember? Your mom will, trust me. She remembers everything. In fact, she always says the best memories she has are when you kids were born. Meg, that's it. This day is more for your mom than it is for Stewie. With all she's given us, she oughta get whatever she wants. And, Meg, today she wants you to be with the family. Really? Daddy, you must think I'm the worst daughter ever. No you're not, honey. What about that fat girl from the Judds? I'm sorry I've been so selfish. TEEN 1: I miss my mom. TEEN 2: Me, too. I also miss my nads. Mr. Griffin, can we come to Stewie's party, too? Sure. The more the merrier. Meg, you have the coolest family. She sure does. Here's to family! To family! Jeez, look at the time! Come on. Come on, kids. Let's get going. [Bodies falling over.] Sorry, Meg. It's another bunch of people that'd rather fake death than go to a party with you. Children, the time of ascension has arrived. For the love of God. Haven't any of you ever been in a cult before? Damn it! I can't achieve transcendence by myself. That would just make me some kind of lone nut. Somebody's got to die with me. Come back, Meg! Whoops. Can't forget my ceremonial white robe. I guess there's nothing left but the birthday cake. MEG: Right here! Meg! I'm sorry, Mom. Thank you, Peter. No problem. I cannot wait to taste this cake. The guy who sold it to me said it was delicious and erotic. Peter, there's a naked man on this cake. There were only two left. And trust me, you did not want the one of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples. LOIS: Gather round, everyone. It's time for Stewie's big moment. [Knocking.] LEADER: Hello? Is anybody home? STEWIE: Greetings, man in white. I've been expecting you. Who said that? STEWIE: Peek-a-boo! I see you! You're getting warmer. Where are you? What do you want? STEWIE: Freedom! What do you want? I want to get the hell out of here! STEWIE: I'm sorry. We're fresh out of that. I'm afraid all that's left is untimely death. [Dramatic instrumental music.] What the hell is this? It's a boy! [Energy pulsing.] Anybody seen Stewie? Yeah. Where is the birthday boy? Victory is mine! Yes. And this cake is yours, too. Stewie, make a wish. If you blow out the candle, it'll come true. That's right, little buddy. What do you want most in the whole world? In the whole world, you say? [Bombs whistling.] [Troops marching.] [Bombs exploding.] What the hell.

It's a normal part of a baby's life. Very well then, I order you to kill me at once! Honey, I know you're hurting. But Mommy has to clean up the house, all right? No, it's not all right!

So I took care of dinner. Really? All you gotta do is gut it, clean it, scale it, and cook it. LOIS: I spent all morning cleaning up the house. And in five seconds, you turn it into low tide at the pier. Jeez. I'm sorry, honey. I'd help you clean it up. But you know how lousy I am with housework. Remember when I tried doing the laundry? Let's see. Shirts, pants I'm missing another sock. Welcome to Narnia. I'm Mr. Tumnus. Give me back my sock, you goat bastard! PETER: Hey! You're right. It's better if I do it.

That's not talc! That's paprika! Take that! All right, I'll do that, too! Can you at least take Chris to his game? Jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat drinking beer, telling jokes, and screwing around. How about a little me time? Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please! All right! You know I spoil you. CHRIS: Thanks for the ride, Dad. All right. Have fun, Chris. Hey, Petey! Quagmire?

[Playing classical music.] [Lois shushing.] It's okay, Stewie. Where the hell's Peter? That was good, Reuben. Now play Brahms' Lullaby. [Sings.] ""Lullaby and good night"" Enough! The only thing worse than the wretched pain in my mouth is the excrement spewing from yours! I wish I could make the pain go away sooner. But I can't turn time forward. Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course! I'll simply build a machine that can move time! I shall call it a time machine. E-flat, Salieri! E-flat! PETER: Go, Chris! Daddy loves you! I mean in a platonic way. I'm married. [Whistle.] Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue! That's the 10th time today! Nice grab, orca. Get Moby Dick off the field before he burps up a license plate! Easy, fella. That's my kid. Now apologize. Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain dead stinking blue cheese feta! That's it! Way to go, Dad! You hit my mom! No, I hit your dad. Stand back. Give her some air. You mean, ""Give him some air."" Call an ambulance. She's going into labor. You mean, ""He's going into labor."" [Baby crying.] Whoops. PETER: I can't believe I punched a woman. A pregnant woman. I just hope she accepts my peace offering. I sent her a little something for the baby. [Melodic strumming from box.] I would've brought it over myself if I wasn't under house arrest. You're just fortunate this is your first offense, Peter. Could've been a lot worse if the cops knew about the other times I broke the law. And there was that time I took a whiz in public. And that time I snuck into Wimbledon. And that time I snuck into Wimbledon. Me and Cleveland are gonna ""amscray."" Wait. You guys can't leave me here alone. Why don't you come with us? I can't leave the premises. They're monitoring my every move. [Electronic beeping.] PETER: I gotta get out of here! There's my little house husband. It's been so wonderful having you home all week. Thanks, honey. But I don't know how you stand it here all day. I mean, I'm so bored, I can't even watch TV anymore. All the shows are starting to run together. NARRATOR: This contains adult content and is brought to you by the letter ""H"". [Phone ringing.] BERT: Hello? Son of a bitch. I'm on my way. Some poor bastard got his head blown off down at a place called Hooper's. Bert, I wish you wouldn't drink so much, Bert. Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat cookies in the damn bed! Bert, you're shouting again, Bert! [Comedic instrumental music.] I know you can't understand what I'm going through. All the stuff that makes you happy like cooking and cleaning, is right in the house just waiting for you. - You are one lucky - Stop now. Peter, I don't do those things because I enjoy them. I do them because I love my family. [Giggling.] Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family. ""Lois and the family sitting in a tree"" See, Lois, the guys would've found that hilarious. Why don't I go buy some groceries and make us a nice romantic dinner? Like when we were dating. That oughta take your mind off the guys. It already has. I wonder what the guys are up to? That's nasty. Where's the damn pull string? [Yells.] You never know what you're gonna find down here. [Dog barking, Peter yells.] PATRIOT: Peter! PETER: You're the Pawtucket Patriot. Verily. Come hither and give heed. Whoa. I don't swing that way, pal. Look, I got a date with my female wife. I just came down to get some beers. PATRIOT: Why spend time with your wife? If you build a bar in this basement and stock it with plenty of frosty Pawtucket Patriots your friends will come down here for a beer as well. Build a bar! That's a great idea. Wait. One last question. If I walk through you, does that mean, like, we've done it? PATRIOT: Jeez. What's with you and the gay jokes? [Cheerful instrumental music.] [Snoring.] [Lnstrumental music slows down.] [Sighs.] [Door opening.] LOIS: Where the hell have you been? We had a date. Sorry, honey. I must've lost track of the time. What do you say? You think the guys will like it? This is why you missed our dinner? To make a bar for your friends? Yeah, isn't it great? Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen. I build stuff and I have a criminal record. [Macho grunting.] [Sniffing.] [Guys laughing.] Okay, guys. I got another one. What's the difference between pornography and art? [Chuckling.] Here it comes. A government grant. Peter, you are in the zone. You know those little clam cakes you make whenever we have company? I need about a dozen. Actually, better make it like 600. That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant. And I'm through taking care of you and your bar buddies! Jeez. Where the hell did that come from? LOIS: Watch the kids. I'm taking a hot bath. Put me down, you blunderbuss! He's a little cranky from teething. I can fix that. [Mumbling.] Good God, man! One can only imagine what foul regions that finger has erstwhile probed! There you go. My mother used to use whiskey whenever I had a toothache. My tooth hurts! PETER: There. How's that feel? It's delightful. [Bathwater running.] [Applause.] Thank you. Thank you very much. Lois, you are a wonderful woman. Words cannot express the depth of my appreciation and love for you. Peter! You must be Lois. No, not silicone. Silicon. And the design of the device is quite ingenious if I do say so myself, Misty. What a delightful moniker. You see, Misty [Stewie giggles.] my time manipulator employs axioms from the quantum theory of molecular propulsion. I've broken my pencil! I have a Barney pen in my purse. You are spectacular! Chris, what are you doing here? Sorry, Mom. I'm gonna need to see some ID. Chris, go to your room! Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one of your oh-so-exhilarating games of peekaboo? Oh, my God! My baby is drunk! PETER: No, I'm not! Him? Yeah. He's a real lightweight. Meg, take Stewie upstairs. [Sings.] ""Show me the way to go home"" Everybody! ""I'm tired and I want to go to bed"" Just the women! Peter, in the 17 years that we've been married I have never been as angry as I What is my piano doing down here? It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet, but Never mind. That does it, Peter. Either this bar goes or I do! PETER: I haven't even told you the other reason your piano's down here. I wanted you to play it. Like it was an instrument. I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys? Come on! I couldn't. Come on! Maybe one song. Pretend you like it no matter how bad it stinks. [Lois chuckles.] [Starts playing piano.] [Sings.] ""You'll never know just how much ""I love you ""You'll never know just how much I care"" Yeah! ""And if I try, I still ""couldn't hide my love for you ""You oughta know for haven't I told you so?"" Okay, guys. Thank you. You can stop pretending now. GUY: All right! ""If there is some other way to prove that I love you ""I swear I don't know how"" MAN: Sing it. Something troubling you, Peter? Nothing. Just all my friends are eye-humping my wife. ""You'll never know if you don't know now"" [Applause.] GUYS: Wonderful! Wow! [Cheery instrumental music.] It was absolutely amazing. The second that spotlight hit me, I became a whole different person! Silence, you contemptible shrew! I bet your gums are still sore. You're so observant, aren't you? Are you a detective? Yes, my gums are sore! Enough of this! I must complete my time machine, move time forward, and end this agony! CHRIS: Hey, Dad. Mom says she was really on last night. Yeah. About that. Lois, see, the guys were just being polite. They thought your singing was too I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better. Tonight? Honey, I don't think anyone's gonna come back tonight. LOIS: [Sings.] ""Gimme, gimme, gimme what I cry for ""You know you got the brand of kisses ""that I die for"" This one takes me back. Now that's a woman! That's a house. That's a fish. That's a bee! ""You know you made me love you"" I love you. Thank you. Thank you. Johnny Muldoon, ladies and gentlemen. [Band strikes up.] I was born in a little town called Quahog. FAN: We love you, Lois! [Lois laughs.] Let me finish the story, fellas. You don't want to be up all night. Or do you? ""Or do you?"" She's a smokin' little pistol, isn't she? Are you a woman? No. My house arrest is over, Brian. Round up the guys. Now that I'm a free man, we can do anything we want. The guys only want to do one thing. And that's ogle your wife. If Lois were my woman, I'd keep an eye on her. Then again, I'm the jealous type. Wow! Lois Griffin! I love your act. Nice melons. Listen, pal Peter, I'm holding melons. And her hooters ain't bad either! Now hang on a second there! Peter, I'm holding hooters. Sorry. No problem. Your wife's hot! PETER: That's it! Your singing days are over. If I wanted to marry Lola Falana, I would have. Look, Lola. This whole thing is just going way too fast for me. For the last time, I'm not Lola! I'm Leslie Uggams! Peter, having me sing was your idea in the first place. I just wanted to keep my bar. I built that thing so my friends would come to see me, not you. Is that so? Let me tell you something. I love singing! And I will continue to sing! How dare you upset me this close to showtime! Lois. Watch where you're going, buddy. Griffin, I got a bone to pick with you. Listen, I don't want any more trouble. Thanks to your wife my husband hasn't been home all week! That singing hussy is destroying our marriages! [Women murmuring.] Yeah, then do something about it. Come to my basement tonight and drag your husbands out of there. Maybe we will. Yeah! Jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside? LOIS: This next number is dedicated to my very supportive husband, Peter. Hit it! [Sings.] ""Don't tell me not to fly I've simply gotta ""If someone takes a spill it's me and not you ""Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade"" Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh? Yes, your judgment lately has been rather You have crappy judgment anyway. STEWIE: This is intolerable! This foolishness is preventing me from completing work on Egads! The blueprints for my time machine! Those are for my eyes only! Thank you. Look everyone, Stewie drew a picture for his mommy. No! [Fan whistling.] Hold up the picture. Let's see. No! Nothing to see here. GUY: How cute. It's a time machine! No! It's a Blast, what the devil do children draw? It's a pheasant! A time machine. Sure. Here's where the flux capacitor goes. I can't wait to build one of these of my own. I'll not stand idly by while you abrogate my plans. You shall rue this day. Go on! Start ruing! Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs to kiss you good night. Burn in hell! Hell. Hell has fire. And you know what else? [Sings.] ""It's got steam heat ""I got steam heat ""But I need your love to keep away the cold I got"" ANGRY PARENT: All right, break it up! What's going on here? Your little peep show is over! We're taking back our men! Peep show? I just do this for fun. Look, all day long I scrub and cook and take care of my kids. And nobody cheers. No one even says thank you. But when the band starts playing and the music's flowing through me, I feel, I don't know, special. I guess you all think that's pretty silly. Not at all. You didn't tell us that part! Peter, you're behind all this? Yes. And you'll never catch me! [Giggles maniacally.] [Screams repeatedly.] I bet he also didn't tell you he never helps me around the house. Or takes me out to dinner. Or notices when I get my hair done. - Oh, no, that's just - My husband's the same way. So's mine. [People chattering.] Wow, this place is full of dead pigeons. I'm gonna go grab some ozone. Peter! There's a king in the cards! They saw my blueprints! What a grievous breach of security! Damn! What do to? Wait for it Yes! Instead of moving time forward to bypass this wretched teething it might just be possible to reverse time's heady flow and undo ever having drawn those damnable blueprints. - You'll never get away with this! - Silence! Lois, you make it sound like I don't appreciate you at all. Peter, when was the last time you told me you love me? You know I do. I want to hear it! Is that what this is all about? Run for your lives! Holy crap! Hot! [Explosion.] [Screaming.] LOIS: There's no way out! At last! My time device is complete! Just one final adjustment. There. Now I shall negate ever having drawn those damnable blueprints. Blast! Jeez. We're screwed! Look, I promise if we get out of this alive l'm gonna help out around the house and say ""I love you"" every day. You mean it? I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man. And to think, if I hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game I never would've learned this valuable lesson. [People talking backwards.] [Mystical instrumental music.] [Backwards speech slowing.] Honey, I'm begging you. Drop Chris off at his soccer game and come right home. I need you to look after Stewie while I'm teaching piano lessons, please! All right! You know I spoil you. My foot! I can't walk! I guess you'll have to take Chris yourself. [Giggles.] - My device! My teeth! - I'm free! Free! I claim this mouth in the name of Incisor! I think not! Bicuspid! We meet again. - Have at you! - En garde! Shall we bite the tongue then? On three. One, two [Screams.] [Theme music.]"

                    			[Cheery instrumental music.] Machiavelli! You've told me nothing I don't already know! Sun Tzu's The Art of War. LOIS: Stewie, those books aren't for babies. Here. Watch the Teletubbies. How dare you! That book may hold the key to my enslaving of all mankind. Fuzzy. [Giddy laughter.] Tickle. God. The more I resist, the more intriguing they become! I can't look away! TELETUBBIES: Again! Again! Yes! Yes! Again! Again! Dear God, please once more! PETER: Sorry, Stewie. A&E Biography is doing the life of the other guy from Wham. I'm free! Free from the spell of those diabolical Teletubbies! Thank you. When the world is mine, your death shall be quick and painless. LOIS: [Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" Attention, please. Tomorrow is softball practice. We have a lot of work to do for Saturday's game. Don't forget how badly we were humiliated last year by Pawtucket Joke and Novelties. [Raucous laughter.] [Peter giggles.] Look at those morons and their stupid glasses. Oh, man. I hate those guys. More than I hate spinach, traffic jams, and the last few years of M* A*S*H. When Alan Alda took over behind the camera and the show got all dramatic and preachy? Am I right? Who's with me? This year we will defeat those Pranksters with our secret weapon Guillermo. [Screaming.] Bravo! I hired Guillermo because I believe he'll be an asset to our company on and off the field. MR. WEED: You have impeccable credentials. I'm sure I can find a position for you somewhere. Back to work, people. PETER: Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for a new line of TV action figures. Facts of Life Transformers, huh? Watch the transformation. Cute as a button fat as a cow radioactive scorpion. Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair. - I'll consider it. - He'll consider it! I got another one where Natalie's one of those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park. [Applause on TV.] Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle. ""Go tuck yourself in."" PAT: You got it. Well, you were close, Dad. Yeah. I still can't believe we missed the phrase, ""My hairy aunt."" Come on, Brian. I gotta get to softball practice. Practice? I thought we'd go next door and welcome our new neighbors. No. I don't want anything to do with neighbors. Last guy who lived next door borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again. If that slut wants full custody of the kids, she's got it. [Short-circuiting.] Peter, they might be very nice people. ""Very nice people."" Yeah, that's what they always say. Then you open up the septic tank and Skeleton city! [Panting.] Pervert! Don't flatter yourself, honey. I don't have any sweat glands. MR. WEED: Okay, time for batting practice, my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys. Guillermo, you're up. Unfortunately Johnson isn't here to pitch today. His wife is in labor. Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him? Jeez, I'll pitch. I don't know what's more questionable, your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity. Oh, how hard [Laugh track.] Oh, how hard can it be to pitch? - Okay. Take your base. - Somebody call 911. Tell them he is allergic to penicillin and white zinfandel! Idiot! If you don't find a ringer to replace Guillermo, you're fired! Man. What'll I do if I get fired? I'll have to go back to my old job as a Calvin Klein model. FEMALE VOICE 1: I don't wanna be like everyone else. MALE: But I don't want to be different. FEMALE VOICE 2: I just want to be. PETER: What was the name of the bad guy from Tron? This is gonna drive me nuts! LOIS: Moving is never easy on a family. Well, we are gonna miss the go-go-go pace of Providence. But with number two on the way, Joe thought it was time to move. And I can't say no to Joe. Ever. Quahog can be pretty exciting, too. Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo. l-17. Darn it. [Screams.] I haven't played Bingo in years! Silence! Ever since you two met, you've done nothing but wax idiotic! I must escape this infernal babble! [Chuckles.] What a little explorer. Yes. He's so full of wonder. To be the Lindbergh baby right about now. BONNIE: Joe, you have to meet our new neighbor, Lois Griffin. It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy? This is Stewie. Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson. You will bow to me. MEG: Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door. I know. I've admired you in the garden from afar. - Will you go out with me? - I'd love to. [Romantic instrumental music.] CHRIS: Oh, he's gay. MEG: You wish! Get out of here, you mouth breather! PETER: I'm as good as fired. Where the hell am I gonna find a guy as strong as Guillermo? One time I walked into the locker room, I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed. PETER: Great. Lois is getting chummy with the new neighbors. BRIAN: She wants you to meet them. PETER: She's always making me be social. Cocktail parties, school functions, that time we planted trees in Jerusalem. What? Look, all I'm saying is put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy and I can't tell the difference. - You must be Peter. Joe Swanson. - Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil. You got a neighbor on the other side of your house, too. So, don't think you always have to bug me. I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have a screwdriver I can borrow? Man, you neighbors are like viruses. Starts with a screwdriver. Before you know it, you're using my supermarket my dry cleaner, and even my postman. Can you believe that guy? ""Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?"" What an ass. - Did you find a replacement for the team? - No. Believe me, I've been looking. Hideo-san would be honored to play for your team. But he wishes to know what compensation you offer. Me love you long time. Gosh, I'd like to help. But I've gotta go out in the hall and chew on my ass for five minutes. LOIS: Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie to your game on Saturday. Lois, I don't want those people there. See, this is why I ask you to submit everything to me in writing first. Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan. He played in college. He did? Welcome to the neighborhood. Hiya, Joe. - Peter! - Don't get up. This is a surprise. I kinda thought you didn't like me. What? Because of what I said this afternoon. No. See I have that disease where stuff pops out of your mouth. Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean? I'm so sorry. I thought maybe I crossed the line when I asked to borrow a screwdriver. Are you kidding? You can borrow whatever you want. Great. Say, you don't happen to have any picture wire, do you? Picture wire? You son of a bitch. [Dreamy ringing.] Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! There it goes again. I don't want to impose. No problem. That's what neighbors do. You know what else they do? They play on their neighbor's company softball team like this Saturday. PETER: What do you say, neighbor? JOE: Sounds fun. So much fun it should be illegal like copyright infringement. [Mickey voice.] See you at the game, Joe. [Cheery instrumental music.] - Hey, you want a piece of gum? - Thanks. - That was joke gum. - What do you mean? Now you're addicted to heroin. I'm cold. LOIS: Hey, Peter! MR. WEED: It's nice that your family is here. If your ringer doesn't arrive soon, you can spend every day with them at home. He'll be here, Mr. Weed. You should see this guy in action. PETER: He can hit, he can throw JOE: Peter! MR. WEED: What's he doing in a wheelchair? Holy crip, he's a crapple! Peter, our new secret weapon is this very attractive paraplegic? Okay, Joe, you got me. Rise and shine. Come on. - Stand and deliver. Get the hell up. - You're a hoot, Peter. - Play ball! - Let's do it! I swear I didn't know. Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him. JOE: I got shortstop. The movers tracked grease all over my carpet. - I tried everything to get the stain out. - What about lemon juice? - What about club soda? - What about shutting the hell up? Isn't baseball great? They say baseball's the national pastime. I can't taste salt. Crap! Don't hit it to Joe. Please don't hit it to Joe! [Fans cheering.] You're out! All right, Joe! Way to earn that parking space! BONNIE: All right! LOIS: Did you see that? BONNIE: That's my Joe! STEWIE: What the deuce? Half man, half machine. STEWIE: Why with that technology, I could escape these wretched harridans! Go, cyborg! [Fantastical instrumental music.] MR. WEED: It all rests on that man's broad, rippling shoulders! [Whooshing.] MR. WEED: All right, Joe! Run! All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah! MR. WEED: Hurry! Joe! All right! Yes, vamos! PLAYER: Let's hear it for Joe! Yeah, let's hear it for the guy who found Joe! Okay. That's finger suckin' good, huh? It's an old policemen's recipe. Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket. BONNIE: Joe, you're so funny. They love that one down at the Precinct. This sucks, Brian. Joe is stealing my thunder. Hey, everybody! Time to limbo! - Face it. He's the life of the party. - Yeah? I'll show you who's the life of the party. Hey, look! I fell in the pool with my clothes on! How hilarious is that? That is so Peter Griffin. Guys? Guys? JOE: That's my idea. MR. WEED: Peter, come here. Finally. A little recognition. Joe has the most wonderful idea. Hey, I just suggested a line of handi-capable toys, you know to show kids the fun side of being physically challenged! That's what kids want to play with. Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble. What about my idea? Come on! Tootie morphs into a stink bug. Joe, you're exactly the kind of man we need at our company. Peter, make yourself useful. Go get Joe a drink. Jeez, first he takes my friends. Then he takes my job. But the way I wear my hat No, no. He can't take that away from me. You! How came you by this metal construct? - I demand to know who made you! - Stewie, it's not polite to point. I'm so sorry. That's okay, Lois. He's just curious about the chair. About 10 years ago I was investigating a robbery at an orphanage. JOE: It was Christmas Eve and some presents had been stolen. [Tense instrumental music.] [Grunting.] Reach for the sky, dirtbag! All right, pal! You've stolen your last Christmas. [Exciting instrumental music.] ""You think you have won You think all is well ""But kiss my green ass I shall see you in hell!"" [Screaming.] Are you Timmy? Merry Christmas, Timmy. Enough! If you won't share your technological schemata with me peaceably I shall take the information from you by force! Wow. Looks like you have a fan. - Come on. Let's get out of here. - Peter, you can't leave. Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd take them on a dream vacation to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids. What are you talking about? We want to hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories. He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy. Well, technically he was killed by the state, but funny story. He did curse my name just before the injection. LOIS: Peter, what's the matter with you? Why are you guys making such a big deal over Joe? You don't admire wheelchair people. You're supposed to feel sorry for them. When did it become okay to be handicapped? Don't talk like that! He's a remarkable man and the rest of your family adores him! Fine. Then why don't you all marry him? And if he's so remarkable, let's see him do this. Hey, look at me. I'm walking. I'm a remarkable man. [People laughing next door.] Well, look who finally came home. I thought you were gonna spend all night at Joe's. I could've. That man has got magic fingers. He found this one spot behind my ear, I Forget about it. I thought my leg was never gonna stop. I don't believe this. My whole family worships the ground that guy can't walk on. It's not too hard to see why. He's a hero. He makes the world a better place. I've done lots of things to help people. Remember the time I sang to the kids at the Sunday school? Yes, you forgot the words. [Singing.] ""Jesus loves me ""He loves me a bunch ""Because He always puts Skippy ""In my lunch"" No. It's not the same thing. Joe puts himself in real danger every day. You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero. Unless I put myself in real danger, too! For my family's sake! BRIAN: Why are the pretty ones always so dumb? [Creepy instrumental music.] [Screaming.] [Cat squealing.] DISPATCH: Gang shooting on Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead. - Is it me or is rap music just getting lazier? - No. It's my new police scanner. This hero thing is gonna be easy once I find the right crime. DISPATCH: Domestic disturbance PETER: Boring! DISPATCH: Report of a stabbing in DISPATCH: All units! A major robbery is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust. Suspects are armed and extremely dangerous. - Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids? - Over at Joe's. Well, go fetch 'em. They're about to see a real hero in action. To the Batcave! [Adventurous instrumental music.] [Bats crying.] PETER: Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! PETER: You thought Joe was something. You ain't seen nothin' yet. LOIS: Peter, what's the big rush? All right, you guys wait right here. Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal. ROBBER 1: Give Tammy a round of applause. This was her first robbery and she was very brave. [Muted laugh.] Now before we go No, don't go. Oh, princess, we have to. PETER: I hope you brought your striped pajamas, boys. Because there's a five-year sleepover at the big house. And you're invited. ROBBER 2: You'll never take us alive! [Gunshots.] Lois and the kids should be in here to see this. Yes. It's going very well. Mom, what do you do when you like a boy but he doesn't even notice you? Meg loves Kevin. Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit! Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl. He'll come around. Such a mom answer. Have you tried showing off the goods? How's that for a mom answer? Creepy. I saw some cute dresses down the street. If nothing else, it'll make you feel better. Come on, you guys. BRIAN: If you want to be a hero, now might be a good time. This isn't what I was expecting. I thought being a hero would be all fun and games. [Heroic instrumental music.] PETER: Sorry, Wonder Woman. I got three kings. Now let's see your pair. [Wonder Woman sighs.] All right. Robin, what are you looking at me for? Look at her. [Space whooshing.] ROBBER 2: Come on. Let's go. Oh, perfect. ROBBER 2: We got hostages! Don't try anything funny! Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan. Good. I was afraid you were just gonna improvise. Actually, I was gonna use the little girl as a human shield and run like hell. But improvise, that'll be easier on my back. [Space whooshing.] Okay, in this improv, Tammy and the short robber are husband and wife. PETER: Okay. And where are we? GUY: A bar! MAN: A pet store! GRANNY: Guadalajara, Mexico! Okay, okay. I heard pet store. And I'm the gruff but lovable owner. All right. Begin. Hello, married couple. I see you found a puppy. Yeah. His name is Sparky. PETER: Well, before you take Sparky home, let me check him for worms. Okay, drop it! All right, you guys. Let's get out of here. COP: All right, stand back! Whoa. Hang on. Sorry, no one can leave. Listen, the whole reason I saved you guys today was so I could be a hero. This wheelchair guy moved in next door and he can do all these great things and Your family idolizes the lousy cripple and not you? That's right! How'd you know? We've all been there. CHRIS: Cool! The bank is getting jacked! LOIS: Officer, my husband's in there! - Can you tell me if he's okay? - What's he look like? LOIS: He's wearing a white-collared shirt, kind of big, with glasses. COP: I got him. LOIS: Oh, thank God. - Take him out. - No! Hey, there's my family. I just want you to know I rob banks because a deaf man stole my job at the phone company. So if anyone's gonna bust me, I'm glad it's you. [Tense instrumental music.] But But I was gonna be a hero. Nobody's going anywhere! Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble! A failed robbery at Quahog Bank and Trust has led to a terrifying hostage situation. That's right. A hostage situation. - I gotta go. - I know. If we want the cops to take us seriously, we have to waste a hostage. But who? - Excuse me. Shouldn't that be ""whom""? - Okay, you. Crap! JOE: This is Police Lieutenant Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out. Not him again. I hope this place isn't wheelchair accessible. Bonnie, it's Peter. Don't worry. Joe's an excellent negotiator. I was a virgin when we met. It took him three hours. I can't believe my dad is in there. This'll probably scar me for the rest of my life. I got a new dress. Try talking about him. So do you like music? Yeah! I played guitar in a band before we moved. But it interfered with my studies. What do you listen to? You first. I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur. My parents don't like me listening to that stuff. But I do anyway because I am not a robot! I also like Radiohead. And even though society has turned its back on you I promise you there are people who care. And you know what? I'm one of them. He sure gets it. Maybe he's right. We can make a new start. Come on, guys. Don't let him sweet talk you like that. Wait. You can't leave now. PETER: I'm supposed to be the hero. Wait! Can you let me pistol-whip you a couple times for the camera? Stupid robbers with your guns and your make-out parties. [Crowd cheering.] [Cops cheering.] Excellent! They detached the human component from the machine. Machine, I am your new master and I order you to go! Engage! Blast! Must be some kind of proprietary command system. Now on the Russian MiG, it's next to the altimeter. LOIS: There you are. I can't turn my back on you for a second. One day I shall unlock the secret of that device. And when I do, Mother, victory shall be Peter, you had us so worried. What on earth were you trying to prove? I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy. I guess I was just tired of him being your hero. Peter, Joe is a hero. But he's not our hero. - You are. - Really? Yeah. You're always right there on the couch for us, making us laugh when we're upset. Changing the channel when something boring comes on. Eating the last slice of pizza so the rest of us don't fight over it. Yeah, Daddy. If you hadn't pulled this stunt I wouldn't know how to manipulate Kevin. And when the kids at school see us on TV they'll think you're a total psycho. And I can say, ""That psycho is my dad!"" I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano, had you not driven me to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a.m. I guess being a hero isn't always about saving lives and catching bad guys. It's also about just being there for the people you love. OLD WOMAN: Help! Someone just stole my purse! Who cares? I don't even know you. [Theme music.]"

                    			Blasted matriarch! She has failed once again to replenish this frigid box with potations. l shall give her a piece of my mind! Damn it! Now look here, you. Oh, my God! [Dramatic instrumental music.] Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie. What you saw was actually a very beautiful thing. Evidently, madam, you and l differ greatly in our conception of beauty. What l just witnessed was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls! Stewie, mommies and daddies like to hug each other that way. ln fact, sweetie, that's sort of how you were created. That is a vile and odious lie! How dare you fill my head with such loathsome propaganda? Get out, you horrid woman! Okay, honey. l'll go get your teddy bear. [Stewie moaning.] Good Lord. You saw them together, didn't you? You know the tub where you take your little baths? They've done it there, too. [Exclaiming.] LOlS: [Singing.] ''lt seems today that all you see ''is violence in movies and sex on TV ''But where are those good, old-fashioned values ''on which we used to rely? ''Lucky there's a family guy ''Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ''all the things that make us ''laugh 'n' cry ''He's a family guy'' What in the name of our Christian God? You're out of the semicircle! All Scouts have to sit in the semicircle! Why? Why? Saunders, tell him why! Because it's Rule 142-B! Because it's Rule 142-B! Good job, Scout. Now drop and give me 20! Thank you, sir! Ladies, this Saturday at 0800 there will be a soapbox derby as a reward for all your obedience. [Scouts barking.] [Cheery TV theme music.] Mom, Dad, I reaIIy Iike Potsie. Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy. No, Mom. I mean, I reaIIy Iike Potsie. MR. CUNNlNGHAM: We heard you the first time. You have a homosexuaI attraction to Potsie. Anything on that remote lower than mute? l got a surprise for you, Chris. lt'll have to wait. This is where the Fonz goes. [Exclaiming.] [Exclaiming.] [Laughing.] Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go. Chris, this is the speed machine that's gonna win you the soapbox derby. But, Dad, l was supposed to build it myself. lt's a rule. Come on. Rules were made to be broken. [Peter grunts.] Here, let me show you the turbo booster. Dad, what would you say if l told you l didn't want to be in the Scouts? l'd say come again? And then l'd laugh because l said ''come.'' But thank God that's not the case. You're a Scout. And you know what that means? That means l love you. Meg? Chris, get out of here! You're not allowed in my room. l thought that was just when you were asleep. What do you want? l don't want to be in the Scouts anymore. l just want to draw. l was kinda hoping you could tell Dad. But try and open with a joke. Tell him yourself. l can't. l don't want to disappoint him again. You remember when he tried to sneak me into the County Fair? One, please. [Chris sneezes.] Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed! And horses can't talk! No! Nothing about this adds up at all! Okay, look. Dad is really easy. All you have to do is sit on his lap give him a big kiss on the cheek, look him right in the eye, and he's butter. What the hell? Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And l. Wait a minute. Chris, l am going to stand up, walk out of this room and we will never speak of this again. [Moans.] [Exciting instrumental music.] Speed, you should not race! Ha-ha! The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha! But Pops, l must race! Ha-ha! Very well. But l am not really your father! Ha-ha! [Exclaiming.] [Crowd cheering.] Okay girls, get ready [Scouts making revving sounds.] get set. [Stammering.] Please God, l don't ask you for much. But let my boy win this race. Do not go until l wave my flag. l can't stress that enough. l'll wave it once just to show you how it looks. CHRlS: Look out! LEADER: Griffin is disqualified! [Leader grunting.] LEADER: Your boy is out of the Scouts! Who died and made you President Nixon? Look, it's been two years! Your idiot son hasn't earned a single merit badge. lf you'll excuse me, l've got to administer some spankings. Come on. Give him a little more time. All right! You've got three days to earn a badge! Three days! That's tomorrow! We gotta get going! [Cheery instrumental music.] Stewie, look what Mommy made for dessert. Jell-O. How exotic! l feel like l'm on the deck of the QE II. Me and Chris will take ours to go. We've only got one more night to get that badge. Dad, maybe we should just give up. l mean, we tried everything. We almost got that one for insect study. Look, Chris. lt's a whole family of WASPs. My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham. Perhaps l can't bake a ham. But what l can cook up is a little grace and civility at the table. Patty, did you know that your mother is a whore? l think it's great that you and Chris've been spending so much time together. But he's the one who should be earning that badge. Where do you get off telling me how to raise my son? Right. Okay. We'll try it your way, honey. [Laughing nervously.] PETER: There's my Scout! Not anymore, Dad. l'm out. They made me turn in my uniform and everything. What? Those bastards! Don't you worry. l'll get you back in! lt's okay, Dad. l'm not really-- Don't take no for an answer, Chris. You're a Griffin. And a Griffin never knows when to stop. PETER: Clear! PETER: Clear! [Gasping.] You saved my life, Doctor! PETER: Clear! l'm calling that troop leader. We're going over his head. Straight to the Scout head office in New York. Pack your bags, you guys! The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple! Ha-ha! Did you hear? The Griffins are going to New York! This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha! l can't believe we're going to New York. Dad, you don't really have to do this. Yes, l do. No boy of mine is gonna get booted out of the Scouts. [Chris moans.] What the hell do you think you're doing? Strapping you in, honey, so you don't get hurt. So l don't get hurt. That's the best you can do, you dull-witted termagant? l brought your Raffi tape. Play WheeIs on the Bus and get the hell out of my sight. Where's Brian? Aren't you coming? No, thanks. l've been to New York. lt's like Prague sans the whimsy. Will you be okay by yourself?. l think l'll manage. All right, you guys. We're off! Those Scouts are never gonna know what hit them. And neither will that guy. [Tires squealing.] [Adventurous instrumental music.] Okay. l'm thinking of a movie. -ls it an action movie? -No. -ls it a musical? -No. -ls it a good movie? -lt has its moments. -CooI Runnings. -Right! [Music on TV.] After years of study, I've discovered the secret to Ionger Iife in canines. And that secret is-- TV NARRATOR: We interrupt this program for some episodes of One Day at a Time. Damn it, JuIie. I'm a singIe mother doing the best damn job she knows how! And damn it, Schneider! I asked you to fix that damn sink two days ago! I'II fix your sink, Miss Romano. And by that I mean I'II have sex with you. And by that, I mean I'II fix your sink. And by ''sink, '' I mean your reproductive organ. [Laughter from TV audience.] And by ''reproductive organ, '' I mean the thing between your knees. And by ''the thing between your knees, '' I. I guess that one's kind of seIf-expIanatory. [Brian hollers.] Peter, we're lost. Would you please ask for directions? We are not lost. And even if we were l can't ask a human being for directions. -Why not? -Because l'm a man. Haven't you ever seen a stand-up comedian, Lois? Dad, maybe we should go home. No way. We came to get you back into the Scouts. And that's exactly what we're gonna do. [Gurgling.] -What was that? -Nothing. [Gurgling.] Peter, the car is making funny noises. You're wrong again, Lois. That wasn't the car. Although you were right about that prune smoothie. Are you okay? l'll be fine. l just have to concentrate on driving. [Alarming instrumental music.] [Groaning.] [Gurgling.] [Peter groans.] [Peter groans.] Come on! That one's not even real! God! We gotta stop! [Car screeching.] MEG: Wow! An lndian casino! Yeah. l gotta find me the stink lodge! [Moaning.] [Thrilling instrumental music.] Come on, you guys. No time to lose! Hold it. Hold it! Hold it! [Moaning.] AUTOMATED lNDlAN: WeIcome to our casino, paIefaces. FeeI free to visit gift shop in Iobby and restaurant on second fIoor. Do you have reservations? OnIy about the veaI! [Laughing.] This is gonna be a photo finish, Lois! [Moaning.] l'm gonna ask someone for directions. Meg, watch Stewie. Excuse me. Can you tell me how to get to New York? Sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am? Don't you want to play first? Thank you. But l really don't approve of gambling. Technically it's not really gambling. We're trying to rebuild our shattered culture after you raped our land and defiled our women. As long as you're not using it for firewater. Look, a bow tie. [Singing.] l'm David Bowie. Bo Derek! Very funny! Now tell the one that doesn't suck! [Laughter and applause.] Thank you. Yes. And what's the deal with airline food? Thanks, ''Watches You Pee.'' PETER: Where's your mother? Over there. l didn't know you knew how to play poker. -Yeah. -How you doing? -Yeah. -That's good, honey. Let's go. Yeah. lt's funny. l never knew video poker could be so much fun. You win a few hands and all those lights go off. And you just feel so good inside. Yeah, gambling is great. No question about it. lt felt so good. l kept putting my money in. And before l knew it, l'd lost $40. l'm so embarrassed. That's okay. As long as you learned your lesson. l did, Peter, for a couple of minutes. Then. This is so silly. l started playing again. l could swear l parked here. Yeah, you did. But here's the really silly thing, Peter. l sort of bet our car. [Exclaiming.] l won't panic. l need to go back in the casino and find a high roller who'll pay $1 million to sleep with my wife. What? That's ridiculous! These people took $24 for the island of Manhattan. They have no idea what things are worth! MEG: Nice going, Mom. l finally get my driver's license and you lose the car to a poker machine. How ironic. Don't talk about your mother that way. She is not an iron. We gotta figure out a way to get to New York and get Chris back into the Scouts. But Dad-- l got it. l'll just get Brian to wire us some money. [Phone ringing.] [Brian laughing.] Damn it, JuIie! I am not shacking up with my boyfriend. I am just going away for the weekend. SCHNElDER: Yeah. AII the away. [TV audience laughing.] [TV audience laughing.] [Hooting.] Damn, Schneider! What won't you say? No answer at the house. You didn't bet that, too, did you? l'm sorry, Peter. l feel so foolish. lt just seemed like such a good cause. Everyone in the tribe gets a share in the casino's profits. -What did you just say? -''l'm sorry.'' -After that. -''l feel foolish.'' -After that. -''Casino's profits.'' -Before that. -''Everyone in the tribe.'' -The whole thing. -''Everyone in the tribe shares the profit?'' That's it! Let's go! l'm sorry to hear about your misfortune. But we're not allowed to return gambling losses. l think you can make an exception in our case, Lenny. See, l'm an lndian, too. LENNY AND LOlS: Excuse me? You heard me. l'm a member of your tribe. And that entitles me to a share of your wampum, kemosabe. Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast. Tell me of your history, of your past. l come from a long line of you people. My great-grandfather's name was Jeep Grand Cherokee. l mean, Chief Grand Cherokee. He was a rainmaker. [Native singing.] [Singing.] ''l'm so happy doing the neutron dance ''l'm just burning doing the neutron dance'' And he also killed a bunch of Krauts at Wounded Knee. So are you gonna give me back my car, or what? l have to confer with the council of the elders. You wait here. Are you nuts, Peter? You'll never get away with this. Why not? l've fooled people before. You remember that time l pretended to be gay? [Cheery TV music.] There is no way they're gonna believe you're an lndian. LENNY: He's an lndian. How do you know? -l can tell. -You think everyone's an lndian. He could just be another moocher. Maybe we can put him through a test. Like a really impossible stunt to prove he's the real deal. Way to think outside the box, Frank. To prove you are truly a member of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest. Do you know what a vision quest is? Of course l do. l'm an lndian. But why don't you explain it to my wife? She's a little slow in the head. A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey. Your husband must go out in the wilderness without food or water. -Or shoes. -Yeah. Or shoes. He must remain there until he can communicate with nature. He must hear the wisdom of the rocks and trees. And then his guiding spirit must appear to him and reveal a great personal truth. And it's gotta be a real vision. We're lndians. We're gonna know if he's lying. [Howling ominously.] [Laughing.] Sucker. LOlS: Peter, please don't do this. We can buy another car. l'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays. Come on. All l gotta do is have a spiritual vision. l've had one before. Oh, my God, Brian. There's a message in my Alpha Bits. lt says ''Ooooo.'' Peter, those are Cheerios. You must begin your journey now. -Now's your chance to be alone with Dad. -Are you nuts? l'm not attracted to Dad. -Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts. -Thanks, Meg. Yipes. Dad, can l come? -How about it, Lenny? -What the hey? The more the merrier. Now get the hell out of here, you nut, and go have yourself a spiritual vision. [Mysterious instrumental music.] Water! Thank God! CHRlS: Dad, l'm hungry. Are we gonna die? PETER: Of course not. This isn't the first time l found my own food in the wild. [Girl humming.] [Peter shouting.] [Girl screams.] [Laughing.] Dumb broad. [Screaming.] [Wolf growling.] They've been gone for over six hours. How long do these vision quests usually take? lt varies. lt depends on the person's age, and height, and sign. You have no idea, do you? Of course l. No. Why would you send my husband and son out into the wilderness without any food or supplies? Because we really like your car? [Lois sighs.] They're dead, you know. [Wolves howling.] Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours. Can't feel my eyes. Wonder if club-footed midgets get justice in heaven. TREE 1 : Hot enough for you? What? l say, ''Hot enough for you?'' Yeah. l guess. Oh, my God! l'm communicating with nature! Tree, if one of you falls and there's no one around, do you make a noise? Are you kidding? Scott fell last week. -He hasn't shut up about it since. -Sure. Stand there and bitch! But would any of you take the time to help me? l'm playing the world's smallest violin, Scott. FONZlE: Yo, Griffin! The Fonz! [Exclaiming.] What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in the middle of a Tuscadero sandwich? Yeah. But l'm your spiritual guide, see? l want to lay a little personal truth on you. Now, Mr. C was like a father to me. And he always listened, you know? And Griffin, right now, your son needs you to listen to him. Whoa! Sure. Whatever you say. Fonzie? There's something l always wanted to ask you. You were with a lot of girls. -Did you ever get a sexual disease? -Herpes twice. And the clap. [Exclaiming.] Dad? Can l talk to you? Not now, son! Sure. Go right ahead. Sure. Go right ahead. l don't want to be a Scout, Dad. l just don't have fun there. -l guess you're pretty disappointed in me. -Yeah! -Dad, this is what l really like to do. -What? You want to draw? Son, why don't you just stick a knife in my heart? -l mean, so you drew this? -Yeah. l know they suck. Not all of them. Some of these look pretty good. -Really? -Yeah! l didn't know anyone in this family had any talent. Except for that one thing your mother does. -You mean play the piano? -No. She. Yeah. l probably don't say this often enough. But l'm really proud of you, Chris. Thanks, Dad. [Singing.] ''And the cat's in the cradle with the silver spoon ''little boy blue and the man in the moon ''When you coming home, Dad? l don't know when ''But we'll get together then, son You know we'll have a--'' Oh, my God! TREES: Fire! Let's get out of here! TREE: Run, you stupid bastards! Peter? Chris? Thank God. Are you okay? Fantastic, Lois! l saw my guiding spirit. Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision? lt was amazing! l spoke to the trees. And l saw the Fonz. Really? What's the Fonz like? l bet he's stuck up. A little. But thanks to him, me and Chris have never been closer. l want a spiritual vision, too! Man! l guess we've lost touch with our noble roots. l mean, sure this casino's brought our tribe money and prosperity. -But what is the price of our souls? -$6 million a week. That sounds right. Take your crappy car back. Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet. All right! We did it! Let's get the hell out of here. Stupid, greedy savages! Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say. This one particular tribe has lost their way. But most Native Americans are proud hardworking people who are true to their spiritual heritage. They are certainly not savages. That's funny, Mother. Just this morning you said they were lazy like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding. The Mexicans are a clean and industrious people with a rich cultural heritage. Yeah. Not like those dumb, gargantuan Swedes. Actually, the Swedish people run the gamut from very short to tall. And did you know that Sweden gave us the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel? Yeah. Which is more than we ever got from those freeloading Canadians. Canada sucks. [Theme music.]"

He's still upset because Abby threw out his baseball cards. Maybe I should make him a sandwich. [Laughing.] Dad. That's your solution to everything. [Sister crying.] Dad! What? Eight is enough.

No, of course you didn't, you worthless little There! See what you made me do? Do you think I enjoy hitting you? Actually, I do. I enjoy it so much I'm going to do it again! Stewie! My clothes are not for you to play with, understand? Thanks for telling me, Brian. I don't know what we'd do without you. I'm on to you. Your pathetic attempts to hinder my work have not gone unnoticed. You prance about this house like the cock of the walk. But will you be prancing when there's nothing to prance about? Will you be prancing then? You just want to eat him up. MEG: It is so hot out there! How hot is it? I don't know. Like, around 98, 99. I don't get it. I think I'm a little sweaty. You! You seem to know all the players in this poorly-acted farce. What do they call that one? That's Meg, dude. You know that. Meg! You vile-smelling girl, you're not to touch any of my things! You understand me? Dirty girl. DIANE: Meanwhile, here at home Quahog remains in the sweltering grip of a freak heat wave. I don't think you should use the word ""freak"". Some people might find it offensive. - Finish your oatmeal, son. - Why bother? I'm just a freak! We're all a little different, Diane. Each of us. Good point. We're even feeling the effects of this heat wave here in our studio. [Sneezing.] Freak. So stay inside and stay cool. I think I saw one of her nipples! Chris, that's a terrible word! ""Nipple."" I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister. Am I to strut about all day like a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta? Fetch me something linen to throw on before I call Child Services! Please don't threaten Mommy. She's very hot. Chris, you're hogging up all the fans! Yeah? You're hogging up all the ugly! Check this out, you guys. PETER: The Rhode Island Dog Show Championship is in Quahog this year! - First prize is $500! - Really? If you won, we could use that money for a new air conditioner. Brian. You could win for sure. You could do your impression of a barbershop quartet. [Singing.] ""We were sailing along ""On Moonlight Bay ""We could hear the voices singing ""They seemed to say"" Sorry. I don't do dog shows. It's not my thing. Come on. All you gotta do is a few simple commands. And maybe a trick or two. It'll be like taking candy from a baby. [Baby gurgling.] Please, Brian. I don't know. I mean I don't even know where my papers are. Can't you get the money another way? I've been trying. That's why I went on that game show. For $800, this chemical dye is found in over 95% of all cosmetic products. Diarrhea. [Laughter.] What? Sorry. What is Diarrhea? Come on, Brian. We really need a new air conditioner. [Groaning.] Okay, let's go over the commands. Sit. Good. Roll over. I'm already shvitzing like crazy here. Let's call it a night. Do you want to win this thing or not? We haven't even talked about how you'll wear your ears. I was thinking up. I need a cocktail. Don't push too hard, Peter. You gotta take Brian's feelings into consideration. After all, it's only a dog show. Lois, honey, I love you but you're sucking all the energy out of the room. [Knocking on door.] Come. I got you a little something for the show. It's Italian. Do you like it? It's exquisite. It's not for every day. Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now. I know how hard you've been working. And the whole family appreciates it. Thank you, Lois. I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs whenever you're ready. And Brian you look very handsome. [Lnhales deeply.] Showtime! ANNOUNCER: Welcome to the Quahog Dog Show. Today's competition will be almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits. almost as hot as the weather, which is once again in the triple digits. [Bird squawks.] Peter, I'm not really comfortable with all this. Do I know you? I don't think I can do this. You can't back out now. How about a pill? - Something to relax you before you go on? - Peter, are you offering Brian drugs? Not drugs. Just a little blue thing celebrities take to help them perform. Well, those celebrities are wrong! Lois, if Liza is wrong, then I don't want to know what right is. STAGEHAND: Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli! Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle! It's time to make life a cabaret! Lady, for God's sake, I'm just a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help! [Grunting.] You there, child-woman! I'll give you a shiny dime if you'll roll me into the nearest lake. Let me see if I can find you a juice box. And get the lead out, pudgy! ANNOUNCER: Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, ""Brain"". We're off to a good start. [Dramatic instrumental music.] ANNOUNCER: A beautiful performance from ""Brain"" Griffin! Go, Brian! [Crowd applauding.] All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up. What the hell is this? This? This is the part where you beg for a treat. I don't think so. Brian, you're embarrassing me. God, he can't expect Brian to do that. It's easier than it looks, Mom. Come on, Brian. We had a deal. Yeah? The deal's off. Me and the little shred of dignity I have left will be waiting in the car! Brian, come! Don't you walk out on me! I now command you to leave. Keep going. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, flip me off. Good boy. [Giggling.] How could you let me down like that, Brian? I let you down? Because I refused to demean myself by perpetuating the stereotype of the good dog? This is the one thing I ever asked you to do for us. This and not do that thing where you drag your ass across the carpet. One time I did that! Peter, Brian, please. Let's just have a nice family car ride like we always do. Yeah. Except for the time Dad hit that deer. Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding. There's no reason to involve the insurance companies. I should still take down your information. Really? You could probably just buff that out. Yeah, but I I would really feel better if I got your information. Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong. Maybe you really don't care about this family. If you cared about me, you'd never ask me to do something so degrading. The next time I ask you to do something, I expect you to do it. Understand? Who wants to sing show tunes? ""In old"" BRIAN: Stop the car. PETER: Is that what you want? Because I'll stop. BRIAN: Pull over now. PETER: Fine. God. Brian, don't do this. Is the doggie going bye-bye? I'm so sad. Quick! Back up! [Sorrowful instrumental music.] Great. Is there a problem, Officer? Can I see your license, boy? ""Boy""? Oh, God. I left it on my other collar. - You been chasing cars tonight, boy? - Look, the name is Brian. - I was just out for a little walk. That's all. - Without a leash. I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down on the sidewalk. Down! I don't believe this. I don't suppose you could let us off with a warning? Sorry, sir. But leash laws are for his own good. The fine is $10. You behave, little fella, you hear me? [Slave voice.] Lordy, I'll never roam again! Jackass. He's the law outside this house just like I'm the law inside this house. - And you better start obeying both of us. - Look at you. Big man, can't even afford to buy an air conditioner for your family. What a bitch. DIANE: Good morning Quahog. The heat wave has finally broken. It sure has. You know what they say, ""If you don't like ""the weather in New England, go back where you came from."" I don't think that's the expression. I guess I had too many bloody marys this morning. But anyway [Belching.] God. I hope the boss isn't watching. [Laughing.] I don't know how those two manage to be so perky in the morning. Something smells good. Homemade cinnamon buns fresh from the tube. [Giggling.] Nothing says ""I love you"" like something from What the hell are you doing, you crazy bitch? These oughta cheer Brian up. Cinnamon buns are his favorite. Really? I could've sworn his favorite was ""treat Peter like crap"" buns. LOIS: Good morning, Brian. My, your summer coat is really coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter? Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo I bought you. It cost a little extra. But I would do anything for you, Brian. I'll be on the veranda since you're already on the cross. Eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns. May I have one on a plate or is Peter planning to balance it on my nose? Peter, Brian, stop this. Can't you two go back to the way you used to be? [Ragtime music playing.] We can't go back to the way things were after how I was treated. - Not after the things I've seen. - What did you see? Was it breasts? Get over it, Brian. I mean, how bad do you really have it here? - When I found you, you were just a stray. - You swore you would never speak of that. No, thank you. I just had it cleaned. No. Jeez. All set, sir. I don't have any change. Sorry. That's okay. No charge. [Sad instrumental music.] Wait. [Stammering.] You hungry? Because my wife makes this beef-a-roni casserole. Out of this world. Look, you got everything you could possibly want right here. Now just eat your cinnamon bun and stop being a bad dog. How dare you? How dare I? Where do you think you're going? Out! You're not going anywhere without your leash! I don't need your damn leash, or you! I'm going for a walk. Don't worry. He won't get far without this. And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered. What? That. Yeah. I'll clean that up on my way out. See that sign? Now why don't you go tie yourself up to that parking meter? I don't want any trouble. Mom, have you ever had a problem with freshness? What do you mean, honey? You know. Have you ever felt not so fresh? I'm not sure what you're I don't follow you. Have you ever felt like you're dirty? Down there? [Exclaiming.] God, no! That was Brian's favorite commercial. ""Brian""? No, it's not ringing a bell. Stop it! We all miss him. Go find him, apologize, and bring him home. You heard him. He doesn't want to be a part of this family. We don't need him. We'll get another pet. No way, Dad. No one can take Brian's place. STEWIE: Silence! That mongrel is probably decomposing on the side of a dirt road as we speak! - Let's get a kitty! - See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea. - I don't know, Peter. - Lois, trust me. We'll get a lovable kitty-cat and everybody will feel a lot better. [Hissing.] PETER: Here, kitty, kitty. Come on down nice and easy. That's a good kitty. [Gasping.] What the hell was that? Something near a window. Preferably a booth. Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans in the kitchen! Yeah, that's authentic Italian. BRIAN: Don't do that. That's what they expect you to do. Okay, fine for you. But what about your puppies? And your puppies' puppies? Am I the only one who's outraged here? I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner. How come you're still setting a place for Brian? Because when he comes home, I want him to know he never left our thoughts. I know you're thinking about him, too, Peter. Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me. Besides, we have a new pet. And we love our fluffy kitty. Gross. Did he just drink from the fountain? Hey, you! COP: Stay! [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Shouting.] Joyce DeWitt? So that's where you've been. Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside. No dogs allowed in the bus station. My blind guy's in the john. I'll point him in your direction. PETER: Brian's tennis ball. Man, he loved to play with this thing. REFEREE: Double fault! Come on, Brian. Peter, why don't you just admit you miss Brian? You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding? This family needs Brian. I need him. [Cat howling.] God, I hate this freaking cat. Can you spare some change? Why? So you can go buy yourself another bottle of booze? Why don't you make something of your life, like this dog? That's me! I mean, that was me. MAN: Yeah, sure. No, I mean it. That was me. Get away from me, you crazy animal! You want me to be a crazy animal? Okay, I'm a crazy animal! Stop! Help! Help! BRIAN: All right, who wants to be next? You? You? Brian! PETER: I'm here to bring you COP: You're going downtown, pal. home. Hi. How's it going? Oh, God. I know karate! [Kung fu noises.] [Dog growling.] Look! A tasty little baby! I see somebody's been neutered. Come on, sugar. It's time. Thank God. He's cute. Aren't you precious? Lethal injection. Next! - What? - Oh, no! You can't do this! Who's up for a little lunch? Something festive. Did someone say Tex-Mex? I'm sorry, sugar. Help me. Don't worry. I'll get you out of this. I'll get us the best help there is. PETER: ""Dear MacGuyver ""Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip, and a drinking straw. ""Please save my dog."" You're looking well. Don't get too close. They say I'm dangerous. That's why the man's gonna put me down. Don't say that, Brian. Peter is working on your appeal. You'll see. Everything's gonna work out. I may have been born with my eyes closed, but now I see the world for what it is. I'm a second-class citizen, Lois. Great news! The City Council agreed to hear your case! BRIAN: You're kidding! If I prepare my case, I might have a chance after all. I don't know how to thank you. We're family. This is what we do for each other. Right, Peter? LOIS: Peter, don't stare! [Lntense instrumental music.] Good luck, sweetness. Thanks, Felicia. This meeting was called to review the judgment in City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin. Justice, for all? Or for some? Does a dog not feel? If you scratch him, does his leg not shake? Yes, he is man's best friend. But what manner of friend is man? I would like to cite the case of Plessy v. Ferguson Wait a minute. Why are we listening to a dog? Take him away! Does not every dog have his day? Wait! Please! I gotta say something! Look, all Brian's ever wanted is the same respect he gives us. That and Snausages. He's mental for those Snausages. And sure, sometimes we have arguments, like when he's sleeping on the bed and Lois is in the ""oodmay"" but Brian won't ""amscray."" - Peter - Okay. Look. The point is, he's a member of our family first and a dog second. And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy. Sometimes we all need a second chance. Sometimes we all need to forgive! I stole $10 from Meg's room! I stole $10 from Mom's purse! I've been making counterfeit $10 bills for years. Mr. Griffin, this dog is a danger to society. Albeit an articulate and charismatic one. But the law is the law and can't be circumvented by pretty words. I'll give you each $20. Deal. He can go. [All cheering.] STEWIE: Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial! [Triumphant instrumental music.] No. Let him go. Anybody want more pizza rolls? Yeah. Quiet, Lois. Murder She Wrote. Charles Montrose, after all these years. Jessica Fletcher! Why I haven't seen you since you had the You can say it, Charles. I'm not ashamed. Abortion. So she's the murderer! Come on, kids. Bedtime. Good night, Brian. And welcome home. CHRIS: Good night, you guys. MEG: Good night. - Dog? - Yeah? If you ever tell anyone about that, I will kill you. [Theme music.]"

                    			LOIS: [Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" Mother, this hot dog has been on my plate for a full minute and it hasn't yet cut itself. LOIS: Honey, I'll be right there. By all means, take your time. When you do finally get around to it, I'll be the one covered in flies with a belly that protrudes halfway to bloody Boston! MEG: Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping in Chris' room this weekend! It smells like old milk in there! If I could find it, I'd clean it up! Kids, keep it down. I haven't even told your father that Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit. PETER: Who said Marguerite? LOIS: Peter, it's just for a week. A week! No. Please, God, kill me now. Damn, crap, damn it to hell, son of a LOIS: Peter! Lois, sometimes it's appropriate to swear. Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. You bastard. I love Aunt Marguerite. Because if it wasn't for her, I never would've met you, Peter. LOIS: Aunt Marguerite, have you seen my towel? Have the towel boy bring you another. I don't want to bother him. Nonsense, dear. You're a Pewterschmidt. Towel boy! [Dreamy instrumental music.] Hi, my name is towel. I have a Peter for you. My name is Peter. I'll be your nipples Towel boy! Oh, jeez. [Doorbell ringing.] Okay, everyone. Give Aunt Marguerite a big Griffin family welcome. LOIS: Aunt Marguerite! Lois! Oh, my God! She's dead! Whoa! Be careful what you wish for, huh, Lois? CHRIS: What if they bury her and she wakes up because she wasn't really dead she was only sleeping? Yeah. That's what happened to our big brother Jimmy. That's why Mom and Dad adopted you. What? Peter, you remember Coco, my friend from Newport? Peter, I almost didn't recognize you without a towel on your arm. Lois, where are your parents? Don't tell me they're still on safari. You know Daddy. He won't rest until he kills something on every continent. But I'm hoping they'll be back in time for Christmas. It just wouldn't be Christmas without your parents. I dropped my watch. Would you be a sport and fetch it for me? Sure thing, Mr. Pewterschmidt. [Screaming.] Peter, we've got to put that out! I'm telling you, Brian, nothing changes. These bluebeards still treat me like scum 'cause I'm not loaded. I got news for them. I'm as elegant as anyone in this room. LOIS: We have to meet with Aunt Marguerite's lawyer tomorrow. She left us something in her will. Holy crap! You sweet old broad, I love you! [Mourners gasping.] [Peter humming.] Oh, my God. She's dead. Madam Pewterschmidt's passing has saddened us all. Yeah, it's a real tragedy. What did we get? Come on, big money! No whammy! Stop! Peter, please! I'm sorry. He's stricken with grief. Before she passed, your aunt recorded a message for you. ROBIN LEACH: Newport, Rhode Island home of New England's most elegant and historic estates the Breakers, Rosecliff, and exquisite Cherrywood Manor the palatial mansion of Marguerite Pewterschmidt. Marguerite is a shining example of how people with a lot of money are just plain better than everyone else. MARGUERITE: Lois, you were always my favorite niece. I just knew you'd find a wonderful man who would make all your dreams come true. But I was wrong. And now you're dead. Score one for Peter. It's time you started living like a Pewterschmidt. That's why I'm giving you my summer home in Newport. Cherrywood? That's so generous of Aunt Marguerite. Our own summerhouse! Now I feel bad for doing that thing with her toothbrush. [Broadway showtune music.] STAFF: [Singing.] ""We only live to kiss your ass"" Kiss it? We'll even wipe it for you. STAFF: ""From here on in, it's Easy Street"" - Any bars on that street? - 24 happy hours a day. Oh, boy. ""We'll stop Jehovahs at the gate"" Can I see that pamphlet, sir? PETER: ""My God, this house is freakin' sweet [Music continues.] ""I make brunch, Clive cooks lunch ""each and every day ""Chocolate cake à la Blake ""Hundred bucks, Blake is gay ""We'll do the best we can with Meg"" Are you saying I'm ugly? It doesn't matter, dear. You're rich now. ""We'll do your nails and rub your feet"" That's not necessary. Oh, my. ""We'll do your homework every night"" It's really hard. That's why we got that Steven Hawking guy. ""My God, this house is freakin' sweet ""I used to pass lots of gas ""Lois ran away ""Now we've got 30 rooms ""Hello, beans, good-bye, spray ""We'd take a bullet just for you"" What a coincidence. I've got one. Stewie! ""Prepare to suck that golden teat ""Now that you're stinking rich ""we'll gladly be your bitch ""My God, this house is ""freakin' sweet"" STAFF: Welcome! That's a wrap, people. Let's get the hell out of here. Wait. Where are you going? The old bag only paid us up through the song. LOIS: We can just pick up after ourselves. After all, we'll only be here on weekends. No, Lois. It's time you started living like the Piece of Schmidt you are. That's ""Pewterschmidt""! PETER: Wait, you guys. You're all hired to be full-time Griffin servants. Peter, where are we gonna get the money to pay all these people? Simple. I sold our house in Quahog. You sold our home? Surprise! Peter, how could you? Whoops. [Singing.] ""I recognize that tone ""Tonight I sleep alone ""But still, this house is freakin' sweet"" LOIS: Peter, how could you sell our house in Quahog without even asking me? Honey, this is where you belong. You deserve a big house and nice stuff. Like diamonds. [Classical instrumental music.] But I love our old house. You have to buy it back. It's too late. Our stuff is packed. It's on its way here. Come on, Lois, you'll love living in Newport. Sure, this house is big, but it's also very intimate. [Echoing.] Intimate. MEG: So we're really gonna live here now? That's right, honey. I don't know, Peter. Please, Mom. Look, there's a pool. CHRIS: Yeah. And there's a chair. BUTLER: The solarium is at the far end of the west wing. TWINS: Come play with us, Stewie, forever and ever and ever. Yes. All work and no play makes Stewie a dull boy. BUTLER: Across the hall from the library we have the billiard room. And here we have the lounge. Sweet Mary, mother of God! Jackpot! What can I get you, sir? We have 10 varieties of single malt scotch and a wine cellar with over 10,000 bottles. Don't make me beg. I did love spending time here when I was a kid. All right, Mom! COCO: Jonathan and I just returned from sailing our yacht around the world. Funny sailing story. A guy's on his boat, in the middle of the ocean and he sees a little black dog. This dog's been swimming for days, and he stinks like a dead otter. Peter, maybe this isn't the place Hang on, Lois. So the guy takes the dog into the vet. The freakin' vet tells him, get this, ""It's not a dog. It's a rat."" A big, stinking Mexican rat. True story. Dad, that's just an urban legend. Hand to God. I'm telling you, it was a huge freakin' rat. Five times as big as that guy's steak. LOIS: Peter, that rat gets bigger every time you tell this story. I got a million of them. Like the time my buddy's sister's boss was drinking with a hooker in a Vegas bar. Bam! Woke up without his kidney. [Vomiting.] PETER: I can't believe they kicked me out of the yacht club. I barely had time to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket. Face it, Peter. You have a knack for saying the wrong thing. This sucks. Lois' friend ""yacht boy"" and his lovely wife ""Caca"" invited us to some hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon. I don't want to embarrass her again. You gotta help me. Teach me how to be a gentleman. BRIAN: Peter, it's not really that hard. Let's start with polite conversation. For example, ""It's a pleasure to see you again. Lovely weather we're having."" Now you try. It's a pleasure to see you again. After Hogan's Heroes, Bob Crane got his skull crushed in by a friend who videotaped him having rough sex. How's that? BRIAN: Wow, perfect. My work is done. But just for the heck of it, let's try again. BUTLER: More coffee, madam? LOIS: I can get that, Sebastian. To tell you the truth, we're all a little uncomfortable being waited on. STEWIE: Cut my egg! Your eggs are cut, sir. Cut my milk! I can't, sir. It's liquid. Imbecile! Freeze it, then cut it! If you question me again, I'll put you on diaper detail. And I promise, I won't make it easy for you! Meg, you're gonna love Newport High. It has a beautiful campus. Filled with beautiful people. And I'm gonna bag me a rich one. Meg, that's a terrible thing to say. You should marry someone you love. That's what I did. And he got us kicked out of the yacht club. You can't be mad at your father for being himself. That's the reason I fell in love with him in the first place. He was so different from everyone else. [Waltz music playing.] JONATHAN: Coco, the day I graduate from Harvard l'm gonna carry you off into the sunset on a white horse. It better be a stretch horse with leather seats and a chauffeur. Isn't she a bit of terrific? [Laughing.] [Rock 'n' roll music playing.] Kids, if you marry for love, your life will be filled with its own riches. Money doesn't buy happiness. STEWIE: I beg to differ. [Rings bells.] STEWIE: You! Bring me The Wall Street Journal! You two, fight to the death! [Dramatic instrumental music.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't have to resort to shock therapy but your progress has been Who are we kidding? You haven't made any progress. Now the left TV is tuned to Frasier. The right TV has Ricki Lake. If you so much as glance at the right TV, I'm giving you 10,000 volts. Got it. NILES: You're so corpulent that when you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa you sit around the magnificently appointed Tuscan villa. This is the smartest show on TV. GUEST: Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend. She ain't supposed to be having no penis! [Electricity surging.] Master Brian, do you really believe you can pass him off as a gentleman at the auction? We've got a long road ahead. But I've worked miracles before. PRESENTER: And the Oscar goes to Marisa Tomei! Peter was supposed to meet us here an hour ago. I hope he didn't change his mind. Maybe he's already here. Maybe he's fitting in so well, we can't tell him from the other bluebloods. I don't think we have to worry about that. [Trumpet fanfare.] Lord Peter Lowenbrau Griffin the First. Play me down the stairs, boys. [Band playing classical music.] Good day. Enchanté. Pasta Fazul. Looking good, fellas. Brian, do you know anything about this? Lois, please. I'm just a dog. A stupid dog. Vodka stinger with a whiskey back. And step on it! [Piano playing.] COCO: Peter, you're simply enchanting. You must join us tomorrow for a game of baccarat. Right baccarat at you. [Laughing.] Brian, what happened to Peter? He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his mouth or asking anyone to pull his finger. LOIS: That's not the man I married. So, I guess, technically, that makes you available. What? Lighten up, toots. It's a party. [Laughing.] Barkeep, it's like the damn Sahara over here! How you doing, honey? BRANDYWINE: Welcome to the Historical Society Auction. Our first item is a 17th-century gilded vessel. We'll start the bidding at $140,000. What a marvelous vessel. It would look smashing in Lois's crapper. I mean ""crapier"". You are so right. Any woman would love to have that vase adorn her crapier. Jonathan! $140,000. $150,000. Brian, that sounded like Peter. Come here, you! [Laughing.] $160,000. $170,000. - $180,000. - $190,000. $200,000. We have a new record for the Historical Society! The vessel goes to $100 million! To Mr. Peter Griffin for an astonishing $100 million! BRIAN: [Singing.] ""Money, money, money"" COCO: Peter, we had no idea you were such a philanthropist. It's a fabulous vase, Peter, darling. Do you collect objets d'art? If that's French for ""Star Wars collectors glasses,"" then si. [Laughing.] Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man since Ted Turner. I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift the whole world can appreciate. I've colorized the moon. Peter, you don't have $100 million! Of course I do, my dear. Now, would that be cash or check? Drop by Cherrywood this evening. I'll have the money wired to me from my Swiss bank account. Very good, sir. You don't have a Swiss bank account! Right. My lawyer's advised me to keep some of my assets a secret in case things don't work out. LOIS: I'm going home. Where's Brian? I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL. Can you help me out? I'm sorry. But I've made my decision. We're moving back to Quahog as soon as we can get packed. Quahog, that one-horse town? Shut up. No, you shut up. No, you shut up. You're the one talking. There's no one else here. Everybody just shut up! What's that? The wind! A pox on Quahog! BRIAN: Easy! If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just so I can poke poor people with a stick! Bon Jovi, everyone. Now I remember why I left Newport! It changes people. You kids have lost your values. You've lost your mind! And I don't much care for Stewie's new friends. The Pacific Rim economy is still a tad shaky for my taste. Stop it! You can't become a bloody fiscal hermit crab every time the Nikkei undergoes a correction! Asia's market has nowhere to go but up! Interesting. Indeed. I wish we'd never come here in the first place. [Sighing snobbishly.] Go buy yourself some more money. Hey, old bean. What are you doing with my Star Wars glass? Illustrating a point. Peter, when Han Solo took the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City he saw that Lando Calrissian had turned control of the station over to Darth Vader. Lando had forgotten who he was. It was only after Han was encased in carbonite and taken by Boba Fett to Jabba's palace that he was able to see the error of his ways. Look inside yourself. You're not a Newport millionaire. I created you. In a way, I am your father. That's not true! That's impossible. Damn it, Peter! Snap out of it! No! I just had the craziest dream where I bought a $100 million vase. BUTLER: A Mr. Brandywine from the Historical Society is at the front gate. He'll be here in half an hour. BRIAN: That wasn't a dream. He's here for the money. Brian, I'm screwed. If I welsh on that debt, I'm gonna prove to everyone that I'm not good enough for Lois. If I only had something worth that much money. I never should've dropped Joe Green's jersey. Good game, Mean Joe. You want some of my Coke? Hey, kid. Catch. Wow. Thanks, Mean Joe. What about this house? I could give him the house and call it even. Cherrywood isn't worth $100 million. Brian, it's the Historical Society. We just gotta convince him that $100 million worth of history happened here. So you're saying that Jesus carved his name into this mantle 51 years before he was born. Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything. And look over here. PETER: That's where the market crashed. BRANDYWINE: Mr. Griffin! You can't take a step in this house without uncovering something historical. [Locomotive choo-chooing.] Wait a second. Could that be Harriet Tubman's secret underground railroad? It is! Go, Freedom Train! I've seen enough. I happen to know that nothing of historical significance ever occurred here. Please, have our money ready by tomorrow. Good day! Wait! Look, this is where the Pilgrims landed at Fraggle Rock! LOIS: Excuse me, Lord Griffin. Your family is going back to Quahog. If you get tired of being a snob, look us up. Lord Griffin is dead. It's just me, Peter the towel boy. Peter, you're back! Let's go home! We can't. I sold our home. Our beautiful home with the stolen cable and the man with the penis for a light switch. LOIS: We'll find another place. Your Aunt Marguerite is laughing at me while she's burning in Hell may she rest in peace. She was right. Everyone was right. I'm not good enough for you. Peter, I don't care what anyone else thinks. All that matters is that I love you. I love you, too, Lois. [Gears grinding.] Lois, our problems are over! PETER: Our mansion is historical, all right. Cherrywood was America's first presidential whorehouse! See, there's Lincoln, Grant, Robert E. Lee. Those are fake! They're real. And, FYI, Lincoln had the jungle fever. So you see, Chubby Franklin lived across the street. Chubby Franklin would always make a face like this. Dad, you're not listening. I have a serious problem. I got a girl pregnant. What do I do? And when we saw Chubby Franklin make his face, we would all make this face. [Audience laughing.] [Rubbery warbling.] Oh, God! Dad, you never did tell us how you got our house back. Simple. I just offered the people I sold it to double what they paid. What? But how could you afford that? I kept one of those Lincoln pictures and held a little auction of my own. Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our house back and I learned a valuable lesson. It doesn't matter if your family doesn't think I'm good enough for you. That's right, because all that's important is that I love you. No, because your ancestors were nothing but a bunch of pimps and whores. [Laughing.] [Theme music.]"

Tomorrow we'll all go to a big dinner to honor him. Why? We barely know him. Yeah. How come he never visits us? Kids, your grandfather has never been comfortable with the fact that I'm not Catholic. [Church bells ringing.] Dad loves all of us. He's just too busy working to show it. He's been that way since I was a kid. And now the winners of the father-son three-legged race. First place, Bobby Hammill and his dad. Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad. Third place, Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn. Now that he's retiring, we can finally spend some time together. I want us to have one of those father-son moments, like on TV. Where we hug and the music goes [Band playing sentimental music.] Thanks, boys. Just like that. Can you do that fluttery thing like when the Brady kids run down the stairs? [Band playing fluttery music.] I don't want to tattle. But is Bobby really a doctor?

And they are certainly not an enchanted forest. [High-pitched noise.] But seriously, tonight we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate the career of our oldest and most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin. Francis. [Applause.] [Whistling.] At mass this morning it occurred to me that I may never see any of your faces again. I just want to say that Jesus loves you. But in my eyes, you're a bunch of sinners and slackers who forced a hard-working old man to retire. So you can take this shiny watch and shove it. [Gasping.] I adore this man! That was some speech, Dad. Yeah. It's a shame Grandma wasn't there to hear it. Bless her heart. She's on another one of her prayer missions in Las Vegas. Hit me, you five-card stud. [Hacking cough.] Cocktail! Aye, she's a rose. It's a pity you couldn't find yourself a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter. Francis, this must be embarrassing for you. I'm in the car. Now that you're retired, you're coming to stay with us. No more excuses. I'm putting my foot down. [Brakes screeching.] Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad? - I don't want to be a bother. - It's no bother, is it, Lois? Of course not. It'll be fun. You're a good woman, Lois. Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all. Maybe you'll just go to purgatory with all the unbaptized babies. There you go, Lois. You love kids. Look at that. Dad's reading Stewie to sleep, just like he never did for me. ""So God cast the pagans and sinners into the fiery bowels of Hell ""where their flesh burned in agony forever and ever."" The end. Children love a good bedtime story from the Bible. Yes, charming. Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac. Hey! That was a lovely service, Francis. Super. And only three more hours till school. I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. Mass. I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m. What else haven't you told me? I rather like this God fellow. He's very theatrical, you know. A pestilence here and a plague there. Omnipotence! Got to get me some of that. Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house. Really? What's your favorite book of the Bible? That one where Jesus swallows the puzzle piece and the man in the big yellow hat has to take him to the hospital. [Knocking.] Open this door! Open it, I say! [Toilet flushes.] Sorry, Grandpa. You might want to give that a minute or two. I know what you're doing in there, and it's a sin! If you ever do it again, you'll burn in Hell! But I do it every day. Sometimes twice. Mark my words, lad. You may think you're alone, but God's watching. Don't do it again! God's watching me do number two? I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert. Megan! How was school? Good. Kevin walked me home. - Kevin? - He lives next door. He lives next door to a harlot! Grandpa, we were just holding hands. It'll be easy for him to take your hand when God strikes your heart with leprosy. He can take it right home with him! Lord, it's great to see you kids. [Theme from The Dick Van Dyke Show.] [Cheerful theme music continues.] Francis, we were watching that. I'll tell you how it ends. Laura burns the roast and God kills her for parading her bum around in those pants! [Baseball field organ music playing.] Yeah, not a bad way to kick off your retirement, huh, Dad? Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought fathers and sons together for millions of years. Stewie's having fun. Why does that man drop his club before he runs around? I would bring it with me. Hey, who wants a Fenway frank? Nothing says, ""Please talk to me, Daddy,"" like a Fenway frank. Is there a bathroom here? I don't think I can wait anymore. In a public restroom, lad? For the good of your soul, show some restraint. Hey, hot dog guy! I'll get him. Oh, no, Dad, they bring them to you. Well, la-de-da. I don't need my food brought to me. I'm not a broken-down old mule! I can still work! I can still take orders! Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad! Aw, crap. That was money well-spent. He just left without saying anything? Where would he go? I don't know. I asked him to buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks. I don't care if he ever gets back. I wasn't being cute. I really hope he's dead. Tom, the city of Boston is examining its conscience tonight in preparation for a visit from the Pope. That's right, Diane. I'll tell you what else will be examined, this cock. The Rhode Island Cock Society is sponsoring free check-ups for this year's Cock Awareness Week. I don't know why the suggestive name. They could've just as easily gone with ""rooster."" I'm telling you. Something must've happened to him. He's probably hurt, or lost, or shanghaied by pirates! That renegade pirate ship captained by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon! [Phone ringing.] Peter, calm down. It's his first night of retirement. He's probably out enjoying himself. He's in jail. PETER: Dad, my God, are you okay? Don't be using the Lord's name in vain! He's okay! Thank God! COP: It seems he broke into the old mill after hours. We found him working on a kick press. Dad, you left the ball game with me to go work in a mill? Yes! I want to work! I want my job back! But, Dad, you're retired. I'd rather be dead. I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville. You know what killed it? Talkie pictures. But you can still make it. You just need a gimmick. I, for one, am a tumbler. Here, watch my round-off. Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of my pocket and put one under my tongue. I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always been the secret to male bonding. It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell and his father in A League of Their Own. I hate to say this but it doesn't seem like your dad is interested in bonding with you. All he cares about is work. Wait a second. Work! That's what'll bring us together. We can start our own father-son business. [Theme from Sanford & Son.] What are you doing with all them bathtubs, you heathen dummy? Pop, why you gotta be like that? We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary in them and sell them as shrines. That's my boy. At least, that's what your mama always told me. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich. Or you could just get your father a job with you at the toy factory. That's an even better idea! Lois, you're a genius. Now give me a hug before I give you a knuckle sandwich. LOIS: Peter, I can't hug you. Cut it out. I'm serious. And this is the nerve center of the whole factory, my station. I assemble our new action figure, Zeke, the moody drifter. You mean to tell me you stand here all day playing with dolls? It's not easy. See, I gotta twist on his head and stick a tiny pack of smokes in his torn denim jacket. [Coughing.] Any of you kids want to see a dead body? Wait here, Dad. Hey, Mr. Weed? Peter. Listen, I was wondering if you might have a job for my dad. Your father? He must be a man of at least 70. Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape. Except his prostate. At 2:00 a.m. Last night, I thought a horse was using the bathroom. All finished. What's next? You did my whole day's work in five minutes. We should sell you to the circus, you freak! I've never seen such productivity. How is this possible? I'll tell you how it's possible. Because this man always put his job before everything else. His wife, his health, even his own son. Especially his own son. I need hear no more. Everyone, this is your new shop foreman. Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit. Dad, after all these years, you and me together, side by side, father and son. Peter, this is truly a miracle. I'm so grateful. Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on. [Sentimental music playing.] Go ahead, Dad. Thank you, Jesus. I have a purpose in life again. Hey! Break up the sewing circle and get back to work! My, my. What a thumping good read! Lions eating Christians, people nailing each other to two-by-fours. I say, you won't find that in Winnie the Pooh. Please don't say ""pooh."" Are you all right? Where's your father? Still at the factory. He's turning the break room into a chapel. A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch? Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin. Bestiality is a sin. I'm not sure how that came up exactly, but me and Dad have never been closer. Having him at the factory is the best [Snoring.] MAN: I got it. Your dad stinks. I'm working triple shifts, and I'm still not Employee of the Week. How am I supposed to compete with that? PETER: Where is he anyway? This'll be for my fourth birdie. Looks like someone's in the zone. Tough break there, Jesus. Yup. Or was it? Boo-yah! Back to work, all of you! What's going on here? Dad, some of the guys think that since you took over, work is no fun. - Work's not supposed to be fun. - Why not? Why not? That's Satan talking! You're a failure as a worker and as a father! Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect. At least I love my kids enough not to spend every minute of the day working! I'm a damn good father, and that's more than I can say about you! [Gasping.] Peter, you've never spoken to me like that before. You're fired! Well, in that case, I'm suing you for sexual harassment. I'll see you at home. GRANDPA: What are you doing, lad? CHRIS: Nothing! GRANDPA: Something's wrong with your shower. The water's not cold enough. I like me showers colder than a well digger's kerblocken. I think it's time someone sits his kerfluffin' down and has a talk with his unemployed son. If he needs to talk he'd best go to confession to beg forgiveness for all his failings! Have a glorious day. LOIS: How can you just sit there and let him talk like that? He's right, Lois. I am no good. Even my own dad doesn't love me. Face it. I'm going to Hell. PETER: Adolf Hitler, Al Capone, John Wilkes Booth. Hey, what are you doing here? I killed a hooker. She made a crack about me being faster than a speeding bullet so I ripped her in half like a phone book. STEWIE: Yes, the fat man's going to Hell. And from the looks of his midsection, he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity. Oh! I love God! He's so deliciously evil. Stewie, eat your oatmeal. Honey, you're a wonderful husband a loving father, and, for some reason I'll never understand a very devoted son. That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly, it means nothing coming from you. TOM: The moment has arrived at last. We now go live to Logan International Airport where the Pope's plane has just touched down. EMCEE: Hello, Boston! Are you ready to humble yourself before God? [Crowd cheering.] What? Have you all taken a vow of silence? Come on! [Crowd cheering.] Then put your hands together for the one, the only His Holiness, the Pope! [Band playing upbeat music.] Hey, I just got a crazy idea! Why? Why? Hey, I just got another crazy idea! Hey, did you ever notice this? On page 375, it says ""Jebus."" It's supposed to be ""Jesus,"" right? - Room service! - We didn't order no room service. Actually I just wanted to check the honor bar. The last Pope we had here filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers. All right, wise guy, who are you? I'm just a faithful Catholic man with a family crisis only His Holiness can resolve. I've never asked the church for anything, but I don't know where else to turn. Dust him! My heavens, son! Are you okay? Yeah. I just got bounced by the Pope's road crew. It's good you missed me. I'm to drive the Popemobile. Any slight bump on the head knocks me unconscious for a few hours. I always wake up fine, but it's just so darn inconvenient to be knocked out that easily. Even by the slightest tap. Like this. [Crowd cheering.] Taking it off here, Boss. - Take it off there, Luke. - Wiping it off, Boss. - Wipe it off, Nine. - Waving at the Pope here, Boss. Wave at the Pope there, Luke. Are you sure this is Boston? Yeah, it's Boston. See, look, there's Harvard. That's just a barn. Someone went to Yale. PETER: Lois, put the coffee on. LOIS: Careful. I just cleaned the floor. Good thing. Lemony. Your Holiness, this is such an honor. Please, go into the living room and make yourself at home! What is the Pope doing here? Relax. I just hijacked his bubble car so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy. You kidnapped the Pope? This is the most reckless thing you've ever done! Come on. What about the time I was on that airplane? [Giggling.] [Laughing.] POPE: Peter, you've raised a fine family. Well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up. I was hoping you could change his mind. He'd have to believe you. You're God's go-to guy. Your father is entitled to his opinion. But more important is what you think. Look deep in your heart, my son. Do you think you're a screw-up? [Sentimental instrumental music.] No. I'm not. You know what? I'm a damn good father. PETER: I have great kids. MEG: That's not what Grandpa says. Grandpa is wrong. Meg, it's not a sin for a girl your age to like boys. Thanks, Daddy. And Chris, what you do in the bathroom is between you and God. And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you. Thanks, Dad! Good for you, Peter. But isn't there someone else you should speak to? Yes, there is. Scarecrow, you've had brains all along. Same goes for your heart, Tin Man. And Kristy McNichol, come back to television. We miss you. I meant you should talk to your father. PETER: You're right. You with me, big guy? Peter, I go where I am needed. To the Popemobile! [Theme from Batman.] [Desperate muttering.] Remember when we brought in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday and it turned out to be his son? I think this is gonna top it. MAN: Wow, it's the Pope! GRANDPA: Slothful sinners! You're here to work, not sit around with your Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father. I am not worthy. Rise, my son. You are indeed worthy, for you have raised a fine son. His zest for life is an affirmation of God's great love within us all. Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope! So I guess you were wrong about me, Dad. I was wrong all right. Stand by, boys. I was wrong about you! You've gone soft on me, Holy Father! Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist could tell this boy's no good! Are you calling me a liar? - Whoah, easy, Pontiff. - Because I'll excommunicate your sorry Okay, time out. Oh! I have never met such an infuriating man! You must have the patience of a saint. Well, he's my dad. And I just want him to love me. Peter, how could you say such a thing? I love you with all me heart. [Sentimental music playing.] - You do? - Of course. I just don't like you. I don't like anything about you! [Music stops.] Keep playing. I think this is as good as it gets. Dad, to be honest, I don't like you either. Jeez, that's a terrible thing to say. I guess I am going to Hell. The good Lord said to honor thy father. He never said anything about liking him. Well, in that case, Dad l'm gonna eat meat on Fridays, golf on Sundays laugh at Jewish comedians, and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife. But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it. Well, fine. I'll be on me way. Take back your job, and give your old man a hug. I love you, Dad. I know you do, Son. - What are you gonna do now? - I don't know. I guess the good Lord doesn't have much use for an old man like me. I suppose I could use another pair of hands on my tour. You'd give Dad a job, even knowing what a jerk he is? I have to. As you said, Peter, ""I am the freakin' Pope."" [Crowd cheering on TV.] GRANDPA: All right, get back! No flash photography, or you'll go straight to Hell! You! You're in God's house, you heathen! Take that cap off before I take it off for you! I think your father found the perfect job. Let's hope so. I love being a good father. But I don't want to have to be a good son again for a long, long time. [Knocking.] GRANDMA: Peter, open the door, and break out the schnapps! Guess who needs a place to sleep it off for the weekend? - Mom? - Oh, my God, no! Quick, everyone! Into the pod! [Exciting instrumental music.] [Theme music.]"

                    			It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy (TV) That concludes our special half-hour salute to the past 1,000 years.  We leave you with a look back at some of those we've lost this millennium.  Kevin asked me to Quagmire's millennium party. I am so psyched. There's nothing like someone else's party. You never have to clean up the mess. Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey! Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey! Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey! Well, looks like someone's going to a big party tonight. You should pick up a chicken-strip party pack for all your friends. Here's a coupon. Look, pal, I don't take coupons from giant chickens. Not after last time. Oh, yeah, and that nice chicken outside gave me this coupon. I'm sorry. This has expired. You son of a - I'm gonna need these by Friday. - Will that give us enough time to? Chicken gave me a bad coupon. - Some other time, pal. - There won't be any other time. The world is gonna end at midnight. - Y2K. - Are you sellin' chicken or sex jelly? Haven't you heard? At midnight, every computer in the world is gonna fail. Planes will fall out of the sky and all the world's nuclear weapons will explode, - Annihilating the entire planet. - No! Silly rabbit. Trix are for kids. Damned long ears, tryin' to take Easter away from Jesus. What were you sayin'? Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know, a balloon tied to a mailbox is the international symbol for ""party over here!"" Forget the party. The world's gonna end. Y2K. I heard it from a chicken-man. Oh, Peter, you are the height of just-too-muchery. Laugh, but when you die, you'll have to go to heaven. And you know what? I bet you run into those two dead bailiff ladies from Night Court.  And you won't know which one is which. And it'll be really awkward. So bite me. - Can you help me with these damned studs? - Aren't you a little overdressed? Oh, actually, I'm just stopping off at Quagmire's. There's a benefit gala at the Boston Pops tonight, and well, I'm trying to nail the flautist. Oh, Stewie, you're adorable. Yes, yes, I rather like the sash. But do the Huggies make my ass look big? Peter, come on. You've had 1,000 years to get ready for this party. It always takes him so long to get dressed. Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's wedding. Aren't you dressed yet? Oh, crap. Well, one of us is gonna have to change. (sighs) Unzip me. - Where's your father? - He's still down in the basement. Peter, you've been down there all day. I hope they're already Oh, my God! The government is here. Run, ET, run! The end of the world is comin'. Get in your radiation suits. We are not missing a once-in-a-lifetime event because of some wacko doomsday theory. OK, OK. You know that one Christmas present you really wanted, but didn't get? - A phone? - A dead Lois? Yeah, well, it's in the basement. Come on, let's go see. What the hell? Peter, if you wanna stay here, that's fine. But we're goin' to the party. Kids! - Honey, are you pregnant? - No. Oh, dear me. Yes, yes, this is how I wanted to enter the new millennium. Locked in a basement with imbeciles, dressed like a gay Neil Armstrong. Thanks a lot. Right now I could be in Boston, pretending I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi. - And I could be getting felt up by Kevin. - Now don't you give it all away up front. Make him work for it. And shame on you, Peter. Scarin' the kids with your nuclear-holocaust nonsense. You said ""nuclear"". It's ""nukular"", dumb idiot. The S is silent. It's almost midnight. We now go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa. Tricia, what can you tell us?  Quahog's fabled alabaster clam is about to descend and usher in a new millennium. - Ten nine eight seven - This is it. - Six five four - Hold on tight. one Happy New Year! - A flautist, Peter. - Well, I hope you're happy. Come on, kids, we can still make the party if we Nice work. Very festive. Actually, each light represents a missile launching by itself. The pattern is just a coincidence. Now that you mention it, the Y is a bit misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing. What the hell. Come here, Hillary. What'd I miss? Holy crap! Anybody else feel that? Good morning, family. Hey, Lois, remember when I was the third Hardy Boy? Peter, there was no third Hardy Boy. Oh, really? Just like there was no apocalypse? He shoots, he scores! OK, we were wrong about the end of the world and you were right. - Can we please just drop it? - It's just not fair. I finally get a date with Kevin, and he gets vaporised. He's just using that as an excuse. Let's just be grateful we survived the apocalypse healthy and mutation-free. - I said I can do it. - Hey, shut up! - Oh, hey, Clevemire. - That's Quagland. Quagland? Oh, you must be dreamin'. Not about kickin' your fat ass. Boys, please. You used to be so close. Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby on account of the fact that neither one of us has had any food since we got fused together. Well, we just finished off what was left in the kitchen. When I think back on all the food we've wasted in this house. Eat, Tom Selleck. Come on. Down the hatch. Come on. Hey, hey! None for you, Higgins. Tryin' to steal Tom Selleck's food. No. No. You've had yours. Thank goodness Peter bought a huge supply of dehydrated meals before the blast. Peter, whaddaya doin'? You just ate a year's worth of food. What a waste of money. I'm still hungry. Everyone leave. I have to poop. Now! Well, so much for finding food at the Stop 'N Shop. It figures. The one time I remember my value-club card. Wait a minute, I smell barbecue. So, whaddaya think, Diane? Can I cook or what? Delicious, Tom. I guess we should be eating her with chopsticks. Oh, my God. They're eating Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa. That's crazy. They're just gonna be hungry again in an hour. Come on, Woody. We're gonna search for food. - Sorry, Chris, the plant can't come. - It's his best friend. Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed. I'll take care of Woody, son. - (gunshot) - What was that? - Nothing. Let's go. - Go where? If there's no food in Quahog, why should there be food anywhere else? Lois, everyone knows there are only two things that can survive a nukular holocaust: cockroaches and Twinkees. And there's a Twinkee factory in Natick. - Twinkees? - Yeah, I saw a story about 'em on A&E. And now, back to A&E's biography:  Twinkee the Kid.  It was difficult for Twink to play with other children.  He was different. He was definitely  He had no bones,  and he couldn't really play any sports.  - That's why we got him the lasso.  - Yeah.  He's spend hours in the back yard playing Wonder Woman.  - He's gonna kill me.  - He loved that lasso.  He Not as much as the baton.  But, uh we put a stop to the baton.  He he was different enough, you know.  We gotta get to that factory and we'll have all the food we need. Well, goodbye sweet home. Maybe someday we'll return. - Hey, Joe, can you keep an eye on the place? - I might as well. I'm melted to the ground. There you go. These oughta keep the rats away. Thanks. Stay in school. (roars) Bring it on! Look, Peter, people. - Halt. - Uh-oh. I am Jorad. I and my band of highway warriors control this territory. - Do you have food? - No, that's why we're on the road. Then you may not pass until you answer the following question: Name something you'd take on a picnic. - A blanket. - Potato salad. - A dead Lois? - OK, we're gonna go with potato salad. Show me potato salad. Maybe we should go now. - Aw, jeez. Outta gas! - Hey, Dad, look. Well, howdy, strangers. You look plumb tuckered. - Like to sit a spell? - Actually, we are tired. - And hungry. - Well, we got plenty o' room here. - And all the fresh apples you can eat. - Oh, Peter, we found a new home. - We're goin' to Natick. - For what? A Twinkee factory that might not even exist any more? She's right. Besides, this place is paradise. - Sure is, except for Randy Newman. - Randy Newman? Yep. Just sits there all night and day, singin' about what he sees. Fat man with his kids and dog Drove in through the morning fog Hey, there, Rover Come on over Well, it's nice to have music while we eat. Red-headed lady Reachin' for an apple Gonna take a bite Uh, no, no She's gonna breathe on it first Wipes it on her blouse She takes a bite Chews it once Twice, three times Four times Stops Saliva working Takes a long, hard look at Randy Five times Fat, old husband walking over Let's get the hell outta here. They're walking down the road Left foot, right foot Left foot, right foot Left Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot Please, Chris, Mommy's got a very big headache. Stop it! Thank you, sweetie. Now, Peter, we've gotta find some food. Oh, my God. Look! - It's Natick. - (cheering) There's no factory? Oh, very good, fat man. We've followed the pied piper to the gates of oblivion and look what it's brought us. We're finished. We're done. Game over, man. Game over. - Dammit! - Get outta that nuclear waste. Who knows what animals have been in there? (cheering) It's about damn time. Oh, words Should've sent a poet. - There's enough food to last us for ever. - We're saved. You were right. We can settle down here and build a house just like we had in Quahog. Yeah, and we can build a mall so I have a place to hang out. And two Denny's, so we can say ""Let's not go to that one. Let's go to the good one."" We can dig Joe out of the driveway and we can build a community just like the one we had. No, we'll build a better one. I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog. Well, this isn't very good, now, is it? Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! - Guess who? - Stop it, Chris. Wrong! Oh, wait. Did you say ""Chris""? Stewie, time for breakfast! Did you wash your tentacles? My big, handsome boy. What the devil are you talking about? I'm repugnant. I'm a radio-bloody-active freak. Yeah, I fold. Hey, come on. Let's go home and get tender with your wife. I don't know, Quagmire. Lovemaking with Loretta has somehow lost its intimacy. All right. Excuse me, Mr Mayor. We have an outsider who wishes to join our community. Welcome to my fair city. If you wanna become a citizen, you have to get a job. - Before the disaster, I was a physician. - That's terrific. We need a doctor. We sure do. Let's hope you get it. Now, pick a job out of the hat. Ah, village idiot. That's a good one. On Tuesdays you get to wave your penis at traffic. Congratulations. Maybe we shoulda just let him be a doctor. No. These are the rules of New Quahog. That's how everyone else got their jobs. Go! You see, Doc, my back tooth is killin' me. And things have worked out fine so far. Peter, no offence, but that's because we all pitched in. - We've built schools and hospitals. - Not to mention the theatre. But when I saw the movie, it looked like Audrey Hepburn not only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's, she hadn't eaten anything in a year. I'm such a bitch. We have everything we need. And no crime, no guns, no pollution. Brian's right. We've left ourselves defenceless. - Guys, we need to make some guns. - Guns? Guns only lead to trouble. And when that trouble happens, we'll blow its freaking head off. Without guns, how would our forefathers have settled their differences? Eight, nine, ten. And turn. Honey, Mommy's making you some new feetie pyjamas. And look, it has a little trap door for when you gotta make inky. I'll show you inky. - Let's see if they fit, hm? - Never! Eugh. Ha, ha, ha, look at me! I'm Fred Astaire. - Aaah! - Gotcha. Oh, you are gettin' heavy. I'll have your father flood the basement, so you can get more exercise. Yes, yes. I do seem to have gained a bit of girth. Actually, my gullet seems to be rumbling. There we are. Oh, I say. I've laid an egg. That wasn't so bad. I don't know what these women are always complaining about. Attention, New Quahogians. Today, my vision for our future comes true. A chicken in every pot and a cap in every ass. Put that away. Where did you get the metal for all those guns? Recycling. I used the pipes from our irrigation system. Are you crazy? You destroyed all our water pipes? We don't need guns. We need food and water. I have a canker sore on my lip, and I keep pokin' at it with my tongue, - But that's only makin' it worse. - There's a reason I'm in charge here. I'm the one who knew the world was gonna end and found the Twinkee factory. - And I gave elocution lessons to Rosie Perez. - That's nothing to be proud of. Don't be stupid. She speak good and everything. - Let's get him outta here! - Throw him out! Wait! We can work this out! I haven't been thrown outta any place since I was a counsellor at the bulimia clinic. Aw, man. Did anybody else throw up after eatin' that fish last night? - That's the last of 'em. - Good riddance. What the hell would we ever need guns for? (Stewies) Victory is ours! Quick, grab the guns! They're our only hope. You remember the other day you were asking me what the definition of irony was? And I said Honey, I'm sorry I got us kicked outta New Quahog. I guess nobody really needs guns. I'm not always right after all. Oh, Peter, hearing you say that almost makes it worth havin' the world blown up. Where are we gonna go? I hear there's a Carvel factory in Framingham. All right! Fudgie the Whale, and Cookie Puss, and Cookie O'Puss, and Nutty the Chocolate Ghost. Come on, everybody. Let's sing a song. Oh. Uh Left foot, right foot. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot. - Bobby. - Good morning. Oh, Bobby, I just had the weirdest dream. I dreamt I saw the strangest episode of Family Guy,  and there was a giant chicken and Stewie was an octopus. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now. It's all right. Everything's going to be OK.

                    			Hello, neighbour. I'm glad we're together again. Oh! I think I hear our friend, Trolley. - Actually, it's your mortal enemy, Stewie. - What the? Don't visit the neighbourhood of make-believe today. - I dare say you'll find it quite in ruins. - What? Meow, meow, meow, meow! Meow, meow, meow, meow! - Oh, my God! - That's right, all dead. And now, Mr Rogers - Fred. May as well drop the bloody formalities. - I'm going to kill you anyway. - No, please don't! How ironic! ""Rogers"". It almost rhymes with ""eliminate"". No! - Wha wha?! What the devil? - It's OK, Stewie. You were just talking in your sleep. But now it's time for you to meet Mr Death. Argh! It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy Meow!  Help! Jane!  Stop this crazy thing!  Stop! Help!  - Oh, my God! George!  - Did you not hear me out there?  - Are you?  - Go to your room.  - But what happened?  - Go to your room!  For 45 minutes I was out there screaming.  I know that cos my damn watch is broken!  - I'm I'm sorry.  - Ooh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!  Jane is sorry! I could have been killed!  So, what are you wearing? Wow. I bet you can see right through that. - Chris, who are you talking to? - Grandma. - Oh, no! - What is it? It looks like Stewie had an accident on the carpet. Oh, Lois. Again? That baby just does not wanna keep his diaper on. Here you are! What the hell is this? Sweetie, that's tuna salad. Oh, is that what it is? Really? I could have sworn it was mayonnaise and cat food. Here's 50 cents. Do me a favour, sweetheart. Next time you're shopping, why not splurge on a tin of solid white albacore? Stewie, are you upset because you went wee-wee on the carpet? - What did you just say? - Hey, Lois Did you pee in here? In a moment. What did you just say? Peter, we have a serious problem we need to discuss. Oh, jeez. This isn't another one of those interventions, is it? Peter, you've been wearing that giant foam cowboy hat for eight months now. Please, for your family, take it off. Hey, I can take this hat off any time I want. I just don't want to. Get away! No, it's Stewie. He peed on the carpet. - Do I do I hit him? - No! - Bend down, Mother. - Yes, honey? How dare you sully my good name by spreading slanderous filth! Stewie, no hitting. Use your words. He's probably just ashamed, Lois. You're a helpless little carpet tinkler, aren't you? Well! The outrages I have suffered today will not be soon forgotten. I will not be forgetting those outrages. No, no! No, they won't be forgotten. - Not the - Outrages, yeah. I think we got it. Oh! Maybe it's time for Stewie to start potty training. Isn't he too young? You know what happened to the Lindbergh baby. - Charles, he's only six months old. - Honey, would you relax? God, I flew across the Atlantic by myself. I'm a national treasure, for God's sake. I think I know how to Oh, God! Oh, God! All right He was kidnapped. You call the police, I'll write the ransom note. What about Amelia? She saw everything. You leave her to me. Come on, honey. He's been having accidents. Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready. This could be a nice way for you and Stewie to bond. Bond? James Bond. All right, Lois. I'll do it. (snores) Oh, God. Not again, Brian. Why can't you stop peeing on the carpet? Dammit! It's not coming out. - (Lois) Brian, is that you? - Uh, yeah, it's me. - Is everything OK? - Yeah, I just I couldn't sleep. - I'll be up in a minute. - OK. (sighs) Join us tomorrow for more ""Price is Right"".  Remember, to help control the pet population,  have your pets spayed or neutered.  Oh, just die already. Ew! Mom, Stewie peed on the rug again. - No! - Oh, this has gotta stop. Oh, God! It smells gross! Princess, I don't see anyone dabbing yours behind their ears. It looks like someone already tried to clean it up. - No, it doesn't. - Mine smells like soda. - I'm looking for toilet-training books. - Yes, we can help you there. Everybody Poops is still the standard, of course. We've also got the less popular Nobody Poops But You.  - Huh. See, we're Catholic, so - Then you want You're a Naughty Child and That's Concentrated Evil Coming Out the Back of You.  Perfect! - Brian, what are you doing? - Hi, Lois. I was just washing some things. Those look like our sheets and our quilt. They are. I'm washing them with some fabric softener. They were so itchy I couldn't sleep, which is why I was downstairs when you asked me if I was OK and I said I couldn't sleep. You know, cos it was so itchy. Come on, Stewie. Don't you wanna pee in the toilet bowl like a big boy? I remember when I learned to use a potty all by myself. I was so proud. Hey, Lois. I did it! Well, perhaps I could give it the old college try. Why don't you put your hands right there? - It'll help me relax. - OK, buddy. Aagh! Maybe you don't have to pee. I oughta just give you some beer. Goes right through you. Wonderful. And while we're at it, we can light up a doobie and watch porn. Yeah? Listen, you, I'll use these facilities when I'm damn well ready. Until then, you shall continue to sanitise my crevasse and be damn grateful for the opportunity-starting right (grunts) Well, not now. But soon! Oh, and I want these and these and these. - Only one. - But but that man over there got two. Peter, I don't care what the other men are getting. You're only getting one. - I hate you! - (trickling) - Hey, what's that sound? - You're urinating! So, it's been you all along! Oh, this is too perfect! I've been taking the blame for Rex. - Ew! It's everywhere! - It's OK. Meg, hand me my sweater. Brian, where d'you think you are, Payless? I say, I say! Paco, grab a mop. Will somebody get Patches the hell out of here before he bends a French biscuit on the conveyor belt? Sh. It's OK. We'll meet you in the parking lot. Oh, God, Lois. I need help. Look, I I really don't even know why I'm here. The urologist said I was fine. Sometimes these things can be psychological. Doubt that. I've got a very comfortable life. I live with a great family, my needs are met. OK, look, so maybe this isn't where I thought I was gonna be at seven years old. It's just that I Is it OK if I smoke in here? Thanks. It's just that things don't always work out the way we plan. You know, I've never been to Europe. Now look at me. Middle-aged, alone and peeing in supermarkets. Man, didn't see that coming. I had this dream last night. Did you ever see Logan's Run?  (woman) Last day. Capricorn 2537. Our next dedication goes out to Tony from Kim.  (""All Out of Love"") We've got a runner in sector G. Oh. What about him? He's gotta be in his fifties. - So what do you think? - I think you're very sensitive and you put up a tough front. I think you're in pain. - Damn it, Brian. Do not cry. - I'd like to pet you, Brian. Would that be OK? You're a good dog, Brian. A very good Keep it above the waist, Doc. And now Part 2 of our very own Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex.  Tom, I'm standing in the bedroom of Judy and Glen Isaacs. Ten years married and still in love. What's their secret? Judy has an inoperable brain tumour the size of my fist, and that just happens to be Glen's fetish. - Brian, how'd it go? - Well, I think I have a bit of ""me"" work to do. - But I'm feeling things, and that's a start. - Oh, that's wonderful. Like most other people, I used to think therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs. Isn't that silly? Hey, Lois, I Hey, Brian. How you doin'? They let you out already? I was in a therapy session, not a lunatic asylum. Hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have gone on to lead normal, successful lives. What did your therapist say? Dr Kaplan thinks the, uh accidents are linked to some kind of midlife crisis. He suggested I go out into the world and pursue my dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow. Whoa, hang on. I gave you one of the ones with silverware in it. Take this one instead. That one's probably fine. Beautiful. Aagh! - Oh, my God! Are you Stephen King? - No, I'm Dean Koontz. Oh. But, you know, thanks to these sessions, I think I'm OK. Being out in the world, feeling my power-and no accidents. - I've been dry for two weeks now. - Mazel tov. Well, goodbye, Dr Kaplan. And thank you. I know Stacey isn't your mother, but upside-down face or not, you have to respect her! Hey, you're Tom Tucker. Hey! Oh, God, I'm s That was rude. I apologise. Wow. I'm a little teapot, short and stout Here is my handle, here is my spout When I get all steamed up, hear me shout Lois, it looks as if Puddles has done it again! Goodness! He's wet everything. Ha! Ha! Ha! I swear, I don't even remember doing it. I don't understand this. Now, Brian, we know you're not doing this on purpose, but maybe we should consider crating. - Oh, God. - Or you could be an outside dog. Huh? Would you like that? Huh? Outside? Oh, oh, and how embarrassed was I when the word ""crate"" came up! I thought I was past this. I travelled the world, for God's sake. - You know how much I spent? - Obviously we haven't hit the real issue yet. Drop it. Tell me, Brian, the last accident you remember, did anything unusual happen to trigger it? Oh, no, it was a normal day. - Oh, Catwoman? - Peter, no Catwoman today. I'm tired. What's the matter? Is the mighty Catwoman afraid of a little Catwoman melting spray? Peter, no. Peter (giggles) All right! OK! Enough, Batman. I don't Not so mighty now, are you, Catwoman? - Peter! - Take that! Take that! I spit water at you! Peter! Peter! Batman, I can't breathe. Peter! Oh, I'm using my special cat power to get Batman all wet. Meow! Meow! You know, just the usual stuff. - All that running water. That's gotta be it! - Mm-hm. - Brian, tell me about Lois. - Lois. Well, she's a fantastic woman. She's compassionate and charming, attractive. Well, stunning really. I guess you could say I really - Love her? - No, of course not. Me and Lois? That's sick. - Come on, she's my best friend's wife. - Mm-hm. Look, I love Lois, but I'm not in love with her. Mm-hm. Who are you trying to convince, Brian, me or you? Oh, Brian, Brian. What a mess. Don't get antsy. I got three minutes left. So what the hell, Brian? You cured yet? I don't wanna have to live with plastic on the furniture like some Italian family. - My therapist's figured out my problem. - What does Sigmund Fraud think it is? He, uh thinks I'm in love. Oh, my God! You can talk! - Never mind. - Does this girl love you back? - I I can't imagine. - You gotta find out for sure. You don't wanna spend your life wondering what could have been. - Sir, I need a decision. - Uh, uh Uh, salad. No, wait! Soup! Soup! But it was too late. And to this day I still lay awake at night wondering about the soup that got away. Thanks, Peter. I'm gonna go find out how she feels. - I've taken you for granted. - Get a room! - Hey, you, the news is on. - Where is everybody? Stewie's taking a nap and Peter and the kids are out. - Come sit with me. - Oh, OK. Huh, huh. Ohhhhh! And now Part 3 of Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex.  Thank you, Diane. Sex-some people have it anonymously. ""What kind of person would do that?"" you might ask. Well, I'm about to find out. I just picked up a complete stranger in a hotel bar and he's in the bathroom right now, possibly doing drugs. Watch as I have sex with this potentially dangerous man, as we take you in-depth and undercover. I've never had a Spanish chick before. Olé! It is so refreshing to see something other than violence on the news. - Your tail keeps hitting me. - If it's bothering you, I can stop. That's OK. The breeze feels good. It's so warm in here. Ooh. That's better. I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin. (chuckles) Mm. Smooth. Well, I'd better go start dinner. Oh! Well, well, well! How long have you been there? I came about the time you started pummelling her with your tail. - You shut up. - You love her. Ha! Oh, oh, this is so good, it just has to be fattening. - I said shut up! - Oh, by the way, nice rap. ""I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin."" Ha! Ha! Ha! Imbecile. Britney and Amber were, like, ""Let's go to the mall."" I was, like, ""I'll go to the mall."" Then Amber wasn't gonna go. So I went to the mall, and you're not gonna believe it-they both showed up! Hold on. Meg, Meg, I'm sorry. That is a really boring story. I haven't been this bored since that stupid drive-in movie. This sucks! Lois, this pasta-better than Italy. It's just my noodle caboodle. But I did use a different brand of potato chips for the crust. Your culinary prowess is surpassed only by your unfailing grace and the uncommon, sometimes haunting, glow of sensuality that surrounds you. - It's just noodle caboodle. - Hey, what are these hard things? M&M's. I ran out of paprika. - (kissing sound) Magnificent. - Up, up. Stewie wants to go uppie. You want me to pick you up, sweetie? Mama's skin's so soft. My goodness, you're affectionate tonight! Well, let me give my big boy a kiss. Another! Another! Yes! Mama has candy kisses! All right, that's enough! I mean, would you all excuse me, please? Stewie, did did you unhook Mommy's bra? - Uh, hi. - Well, hello, Brian. - I I think we should talk. - Sure. Lois did your heart ever want to ask something but your head was too afraid of what the answer might be? Oh. Oh, God. Sometimes it's best not to ask those questions. Sometimes we should cherish what we already have, like a very special friendship, let's say like the one you and I share, that someone like me wouldn't change for anything in the world. Someone like me wouldn't change it for anything in the world either. I'm glad. To be clear-we were talking about me being in love with you and you rejecting me, right? - Yes. - I was just making sure. Say we were drunk and knew we wouldn't remember? I'd have to be really, really No! I tell you, Peter, I wish I'd taken this up years ago. My great-great-great uncle Angus Griffin invented the game. So we're all clear on the rules, then? No Jews and no blacks. Aye. - You're like the Arnold Palmer of golf. - Yeah, life is good. I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards right, I've got seven years ahead of me. - Whatever happened with your lady friend? - We decided to stay good friends. There are a lot of different kinds of love, and ours was perfect the way it was. So she dumped you, huh? To hell with her. She'll probably end up with some idiot. Serves her right! Damn. Damn. Damn. Damn. Mulligan. Damn."

                    			Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons. A stunning development tonight as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent. We have the identity of the real killer. But first It's fall. The time of year when the leaves turn a pretty, purpley orange and Quahog prepares for its annual Harvest Festival Parade. Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa joins us live from the ceremony where they are choosing this year's theme. Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves. Gently tied to each of their delicate legs is a parade theme suggested by ordinary citizens of Quahog. And here to pick this year's winning theme is Ten Commandments star, Charlton Heston. Let my pigeons go! [Wings flapping.] [Gun loading.] He nailed one! We have our theme! I submitted ""togetherness."" A simple theme. But powerful, nonetheless. Come on, ""overcoming adversity""! Let's go, ""overcoming adversity""! Show me ""women I gave the clap to""! And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is: ""The episode of Who's the Boss? ""where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower."" Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable! [Cheering.] Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley must be turning over in his grave. Wait a minute. He's not dead yet. ""Michael Flatley."" It's great they picked your theme, but isn't it a little esoteric? Esoteric? - Could it mean ""sexy""? - I think it's a science term. Fellas, esoteric means ""delicious."" Who's the Boss? Is not a food. BRIAN: Swing and a miss. LOIS: [Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" I have no friends, and it's all because of this stupid purse! What did you do to my daughter? I swear to God, if you touched her Honey, what happened? It was lunchtime and I love the color of your Prada bag. - Yeah, but yours has that great clasp. - Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch? You know what? There's no room in my car for your big, ugly purse. [Girls laughing.] Meg, let me tell you about popularity. GIRL #1: Mrs. Canner? Are you coming? CANNER: Bye! Daddy, if you really loved me, you'd buy me a Prada bag. I can't say no to you, honey. What are they, like, $10? More like $1,100. [Laughing.] You wish I loved you that much! [Sighs.] We'll never finish the float in time for the parade. Pick up the pace, guys! Peter, your theme is a dud. Yeah. I've never even seen Who's the Boss? Tuesdays in the '80s I was always in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00. But I can't do it without you guys, because I'll tell you who's the boss. It's not Tony or Angela. It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us. You're the boss because you never give up, like with the ladies. Gemini. Capricorn. I know you're not a Virgo! From down here, you look like a Pisces! And Cleveland, you're the boss because of your attention to detail. Like when we play pool, you take so long to line up your shots I just want to crack you with a cue stick. But I don't because that would be a hate crime, and I love you. And Joe, I've had new neighbors before, but none were half the man you are. Since you're half a man already, that splits them into some kind of fraction I can't even measure. He's right. If we work together, we can win this thing. Who's in? Go, Spooner Street! [Heroic instrumental music.] My dad always says, ""Measure twice, cut once."" My daddy always said, ""Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed!"" [Laughing.] We didn't measure! BRIAN: Amazing. The whole neighborhood is working together. You know what's really amazing? I haven't brushed my teeth in three days, and no one has said a thing. If I had a job, I could buy the bag myself. I have squandered my munitions budget on that insipid Rugrats video! Perhaps I should seek employment. Mother teaches piano. I suppose I could as well. All right, try it again, Richard. And remember, the wrong keys are electrified. [Electric shock.] I don't want to play the piano! Indeed. Would you rather play the bassoon? [Playing bassoon.] [Screams.] No experience? No, thanks. [Sighs.] [Whispering.] Oh, nuts. Young lady. What's the little guy's name? What do you care? I can't send an unwed teenage mother out on the street without a job. Stewie. My son's name is Stewie. DIANE: Welcome to the 83rd annual Quahog Harvest Festival Parade. Are you as excited as I am, Tom? Are you kidding, Diane? I've got wood and clipped onto it is a list of this year's float entries. Remember, the float that best captures this year's theme wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam. And here's our first float. DIANE: It looks like some wires got crossed on Clover Street. That's not Angela. That's Mona, Angela's mom. TOM: Wonderful use of tree bark for the age spots though. This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan. That's just plain wrong. Each float possesses its own unique charm. But none of them Oh, baby! Look at that! The float turned out great. Our neighborhood hasn't been this united since Quagmire got us free cable. CLEVELAND: We are not bad people. We just don't want to pay $12 a month for Cinemax. First place goes to Spooner Street. [Cheering.] RESIDENTS: We won! All right! [Uncomfortable laughter.] Come on now! This is damn foolish! My theme, my trophy! My aunt Fanny! You said it yourself! I'm the boss! He said I, too, was the boss. And it's time Cleveland got his due. BONNIE: Joe, my feet are starting to swell. You two go home. I can stay here as long as it takes. You'd be amazed how little one eats when your legs don't work. There's only one way to settle this. Russian Roulette. Three bullets, last guy standing keeps the trophy. Me first. No. Wait a minute, this is crazy. You first. There's gotta be a way for you all to enjoy the trophy. Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it. There it is again! LOIS: Perfect, Peter. Now we can all enjoy it. [Muttering approval.] Here's to togetherness! Car! [Car approaching.] Meg, order up! Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself. I don't care if they're from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan! Try them. You'll like them. Yes, well, I rather doubt that. Yes! These are delectable. Flappy, good news! I've decided not to kill you! What a precious little boy. That's my son. Your son? But you're just a baby yourself. Henry, give the little skank a nice tip. $20! Welcome to Flappy's. Why don't you sit next to my baby whose deadbeat dad doesn't pay child support. [Belching.] [Horrified scream.] [Dramatic instrumental music.] Peter, what is it? CLEVELAND: What's going on out here? Clear the way! I'm a cop! Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on. I'm so sorry. That's okay, son. It's your right as an American citizen. [Screaming.] QUAGMIRE: What's all the noise? I was just jerked out of a sound sleep. Perhaps someone could enlighten me as to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam? - Maybe it fell. - Yeah. Right into someone's pocket. You think one of us stole it? I never said the word ""stole."" Looks like someone has a guilty conscience. Guilty conscience! I'm the only guy on this block who actually pays for his cable. Pretty high and mighty for a man who left our nation's flag out in the rain last Fourth of July. That's against the law, Officer! [Gasping.] You're one to talk. Out there every trash day picking through my garbage. That's an invasion of my privacy. [Gasping.] He's sorting your recycling because he loves our Mother Earth. If you weren't so busy trolling for booty all the time you could do it yourself, like the law says you should. [Gasping.] PETER: It's on now! JOE: Wait a second! What about Peter? He's the one who wanted the trophy all along! I couldn't have stolen it. Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder so I could steal the trophy tonight. What? It's a ladder. He can't use it. It's like taking a watch off a dead guy. Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe. Real oddballs. I don't trust them. LOIS: I saw them taking coupons out of our mailbox. QUAGMIRE: I don't like the look of her! I offer you a recipe. Combine one small-town neighborhood with a dash of missing trophy and what you're left with is a gumbo fit only for a madman. A gumbo served almost exclusively in The PETER: Who the hell is that? I bet he took it! JOE: Where are you going, Serling? Want some of this? QUAGMIRE: Come back here! I'm off to work. PETER: Okay, honey. One of our neighbors took that trophy, and I'll find out who. - I'm taking Stewie with me again. - Fine, sweetie. This whole thing just makes me sick! - We played Pictionary with them! - Bastards! Giddy-up, you stubby little mare! To the pancake house! Well, bye. And to think they used to be our best friends! That was then and this is now! And this is a chair. That's a lamp. You have boobies. I'll find that trophy! JOE: To be honest, Peter, we were all a little surprised you invited us over. We realized our friendship is a lot more important than some stupid trophy. [Kettle whistling.] There's the tea. I'll get it, Lois. Two sugars, right, Bonnie? [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Damn, it's not here! [Suspenseful instrumental music.] Not here either. [Footsteps.] [Suspenseful instrumental music.] ['60s lounge music on stereo.] Nothing. Oh, my God! We were robbed! - Is anything missing? - No. I don't think so. LOIS: Where's that picture of me in my two-piece? Should I call the cops? I'm guessing a cop had something to do with this. Or a pilot. Or a deli owner. Okay, you dirtbags! This means war! Excuse us. We're having a small problem with home security. Do you have those round metal things that you bury in the ground and, when stepped on, they explode? - Land mines? - Land mines. It was land mines. - Quagmire. - Peter. - Cleveland. - Joe. - Bonnie. - Lois. - Cleveland. - Lois. Bonnie. - Quagmire. - Peter. [Clears throat.] Loretta. Come on, Peter. That ought to slow them down. Being a single mother is hard. The real challenge is having a baby that's addicted to crack. - Right, Stewie? - What's that? Yes. I love crack. I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack! This is the first time he's eaten something other than dog food in three weeks. Here's your check. God bless. WAITRESS: Here, Honey. STEWIE: What's this? Blueberries? Oh, my That's better than sex! And could I get that waitress' address? I'd like to help her baby. What are they up to? Cleveland and Quagmire are holding their positions but I haven't seen Joe all day. JOE: Freeze! KEVIN: Dad? JOE: Careful. There's a bear trap two feet to your right. KEVIN: Thanks, Dad. JOE: Look out for your mother! BONNIE: There's a sandwich on the counter, honey. Cleveland, these lobster traps aren't going to catch any intruders. Yes, they will. I baited them with these plump and tasty Fenway franks. Daddy, we got one! Fat boy smelled a hot dog. Couldn't help it. Went right in. [Laughing.] [Classical instrumental music.] - Hello. - Say, get the hell off Hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass. Yes. I was hoping I could ask you about your neighbors, the Griffins. A bunch of card-carrying Commies if you ask me! All right. No! It's not all right! CLEVELAND JR: Fat boy! The Griffins are not to be trusted. Those people are nothing but vile, cheating, lying scum. And their carpet and drape scheme No! No, I won't! Get that puree of loathsomeness away from me! But you love mashed turkey and peas. I'm sorry. What was that? Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Did you just tell me what I love? Write this down, you toad-faced frump. I love pancakes! Hi, little fella. SANDY: Is Meg Griffin here? LOIS: No, she's not. Probably out scoring more rock. Sandy Balfour, Child Services. We're placing this baby in a foster home. - What? - For God's sake, feed me! Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow? What an awful home for a child! How dare you! This is a wonderful home! [Gunshot.] PETER: Quagmire, you rat bastard! Come near my fence again, and that'll be your head! QUAGMIRE: Shut up! Honey, would you like some pancakes? Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me! Stewie! MEG: Next up is Meg Griffin, sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new A woman from Child Services came and took Stewie! She said we fed him dog food! Dog food? Is that a real Prada bag? How in the world did you make $1,100 as a waitress in one week? It's easy when you're the unwed teenage mother of a crack-addicted baby. [Laughing nervously.] Wait a minute. Meg, when did you become a teenager? She's 16, Peter. You knew about this? FOSTER MOM: Welcome to your new home. Baby Stewie, say hello to your new brothers and sisters. Hola, Stewie. Ni hao, Stewie. Stewie. Good God! I've been adopted by a Benetton ad! - I promise, it'll never happen again. - I hope not, Mrs. Stevens. Because next time we won't just take him away, we'll kill him. Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens! So this is where babies come from? Yes, Chris. This is where babies come from. You told me I came out of your vagina! Next! Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins. - I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork. - Look harder! I want my baby back! Please, let me handle this. The name's Griffin. We're the ones who fed dog food to our crack-addicted baby. I never was any good at dealing with the authorities. [Police siren.] Don't worry. I know how to handle this. Are you aware you were going 50 in I'm gonna have to ask you to put your shirt down. Crap. I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island. [Stewie screams angrily.] STEWIE: Damn it! I want pancakes! You people understand every language except English! Yo quiero pancakes! Donnez-moi pancakes! Click-click-bloody-click pancakes! Poor little guy. ""Pancakes"" must be street for ""crack."" Damn those parents of his. Sarah, forgiveness. Now, Stewie, why don't you go play with the others? GIRL: Stewie, come complete our rainbow! I've got a better idea. Let's go play ""swallow the stuff under the sink."" You lied to them! You told Child Services that we steal lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes and worship some guy named Stan. Actually, I said Satan. That's a typo. We didn't know who she was! It's not our fault! No? Then whose fault is it? BRIAN: It's all of yours! You were all working together just fine, but then you won that stupid trophy. You put some shiny hunk of metal before your own friendships. Brian's right. We were so obsessed with that trophy, we lost sight of what was really going on. - Now we have a real problem to deal with. - That's right! Somebody tipped off the cable company about our free Cinemax. Joe? And we have to get Stewie back! PETER: I remembered. CLEVELAND: We're here to help. And we must get our baby back. Right on! Let's do it! Rock their world! GROUP: Yeah! Come on! Let's go! We can do it! See kids? One day the world is going to be just like our home. All races living together in harmony and love. [Creaking.] Pancakes! He must still be working the junk out of his system. He needs hugs! [Doorbell ringing.] Doorbell! We're from the One World, One People Book-of-the-Month Club. Is there something missing in your life? You know, I just bet there is. Sarah, we have guests! And one of them is a homosexual! BONNIE: They're in place! God, it gets me hot when Joe lies to strangers. When I get him home, I swear I'm gonna grease up That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris. Here we go, Dad! Stewie, would you like to learn how to wrap a turban? Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl? Or perhaps she can learn after her people invade your country. Yee, would your people really do this? Try and stop them. And try and stop Pablo's people from using drug money to buy arms from Li's countrymen, who in turn sells them to Ura's people so they can ethnically cleanse this nauseatingly diverse grab bag of genetic party favors you call a family. So now you all understand, yes? You all hate each other? [Crying.] Hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils. Hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus. Just practicing for Christmas. But you're white. Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian. Don't be stupid! Santa is black! Santa can't be black. We do not fear him. CHINESE GIRL: Cram it, Gandhi! Santa is Asian. How can he be Asian? Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles under the speed limit with his blinker on! Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan! [Yelling.] PETER: Come on, Stewie. We're out of here. Dance, puppets! Dance! Lois, we got him. It's all over. LOIS: Careful, Peter. Joe and Cleveland can't stall them. They're heading your way! Crap! FOSTER DAD: Hold it right there! Or what? Don't shoot! STEWIE: Now shoot! So, we're terribly sorry we broke into your home. But we just had to get Stewie back somehow. That's a very long story. But we've grown attached to little Stewie. Plus, the law's on our side. You people can kiss the fattest part of my ass! We'll be back, Stewie. FOSTER MOM: Wait! Is that a real Prada bag? I'd like to propose a toast to our neighbors. Sure they may be black, handicapped, and a heartless sex hound but if they moved out, some smelly Hawaiians might move in. - Hear, hear! - Where's Quagmire? If it wasn't for him, we never would have found out where Stewie's foster family lived. He said he'd distract the social worker. Glen, honey, I have a question for you. What do you do for a living? I have a question for you, too. Why are you still here? What the heck happened to that trophy anyway? I guess some mysteries are better left unsolved. [Chattering.] Submitted for your approval. A family pet with the uncontrollable urge to bury shiny objects in the yard. A shameful secret that nearly buried the peace and civility of an entire neighbor Stewie seems a little feverish after his ordeal. And he keeps asking for pancakes. Let's just let him rest. Flappy, what have you done to me? It's so hot. Now I'm freezing! What I wouldn't do for one syrup-soaked bite. [Screams.]"

                    			LOIS: [Singing.] ""It seems today that all you see ""is violence in movies and sex on TV ""But where are those good, old-fashioned values ""on which we used to rely? ""Lucky there's a family guy ""Lucky there's a man who'll positively tell you ""all the things that make us ""laugh 'n' cry ""He's a family guy"" [Crickets chirping.] - I'm Morley Safer. - I'm Mike Wallace. - I'm Ed Bradley. - I'm Lesley Stahl. And one of you is hung like an elf. [Laughing.] LOIS: I feel so naughty. PETER: Lois, what are you doing? Neither of us is drunk. [Giggling.] PETER: Knock it off! LOIS: Oh, my God! I found a lump! A breast lump! The important thing is to stay calm. It's probably nothing, honey. That's easy for you to say. You get to keep both your cans. Peter, don't talk like that! You'll see a doctor tomorrow and No. I'm not gonna see a doctor, Lois. The healthiest thing we can do is just ignore this and pretend it doesn't exist. Just like we do with the squid. LOIS: Earthquake. PETER: Truck going by. PETER: I'm gonna be fine. Nothing to worry about. [Cat hisses.] [Vulture screeches.] MAN: Morning. Give it to me straight, Doc. How long do I have? Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have about a month to live. But what the hell do I know? I've been sued by every patient I ever had. Look at the size of this file. This is Wow. Let's just wait for the test results. Finish up, honey. Then I'll put you down for a nice nap. No! I shall put you down for a nap, Mother! Blast! I'm so worried about your father. You mean because he's a borderline alcoholic? No. Mommy's made peace with that. Because he's got a lump on his booby. Chris, that's a terrible word, ""booby."" Mom, Debbie Miller's dad had a lump on his breast, and he turned out okay. Really? Who's Debbie Miller? A girl I just made up. Look. Here they are. My family. Guys, I don't say this often enough, but I'm gonna die. LOIS: Oh, my God. STEWIE: High five! Anyone? Anyone? You can't die! Who's gonna take me to the Father-Son dance? Listen, I've had a good life. You can always be proud of your father and all of his accomplishments. MEG: Accomplishments? PETER: Go to your room. Peter, there's no way you could die. You're the most important character in this family. [Somber music playing.] I'll take this one. But I won't pay a cent over $60. Sir, that casket costs $1,000. PETER: Okay, $70. SALESMAN: What? PETER: $2,000. SALESMAN: That's twice the cost! PETER: $40. SALESMAN: What? He doesn't know how to haggle. Peter, what's going on? I'm selling all my worldly goods, so you'll have some cash when I'm dead. Yeah, a lot of memories here. Look, my first bike. Boy, I had so much fun playing with that. More tea, Mr. Bike? Peter, this is ridiculous. You're going to be fine. Dad, the doctor called. Your test results are in. This doesn't look very good. No, this doesn't look very good at all. My nephew drew my portrait. It doesn't look a thing like me. Look at the nose. It's all Will you just tell us about Peter's tests? Okay. Mr. Griffin, all your tests came back negative. As it turns out, the lump on your chest was just a fatty corpuscle. Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute. How the hell can a dead comedian from the silent movie era be lodged in my left bosom? Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine. I'm fine? What? Are you coming on to me now? Peter, he's not coming on to you. He's trying to tell you that you're healthy. Can't it be both? [Kissing.] My sweetie is okay. Better than okay, Lois. From now on, I'm gonna appreciate all the little things in life, like you and the kids. Is this the price of my bill or my phone number? Your phone number. [Sheepish laughter.] PETER: It's still pretty pricey! LOIS: Peter, who cares how much it is? You've just got the most important bill of all, a clean bill of health. Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting to crack out that gem? PETER: This sucks, Brian. Why should I have to pay this? - There's nothing wrong with me. - Too bad you're not dying. Wait a second. That's it! They can't make a dead guy pay his bill. All I gotta do is write ""deceased"" right here where it says ""name."" And where it says ""sex,"" I'll write, ""No, thanks. I'm dead."" It's bulletproof. [Crickets chirping.] But you promised the fat one would perish. I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey? Your father is alive and well and we can be a family for a good long [Knocking.] Who are you? DEATH: I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the hell do you think I am? I'm Death. DEATH: Which one of you is Peter Griffin? PETER: He is. DEATH: Come on, man. Which one of you is Peter Griffin? This is Peter Griffin. [Laughing.] DEATH: That's a good one. [Continues laughing.] LOIS: Why are you DEATH: No, wait. I'm not finished holding my sides. [Continues laughing.] Why are [Continues laughing.] Why [Continues laughing.] Why are you here? The doctor said Peter was okay. DEATH: The doctor! I guess he must know, right? I mean, he's a doctor and everything, and I'm just Death! STEWIE: Excuse me. Hello! I'm Stewie. Big fan. PETER: Death, you made a mistake. I'm not supposed to be dead. DEATH: I made a mistake? What's this? LOIS: Peter, is that your handwriting? [Nervous laughter.] How did you get that? DEATH: Your HMO emailed it to me. I know my doctor was hitting on me, but you don't have to call him names. I don't care what that says! You can't take my husband! Mother! Where are your manners? Don't argue with our guest! STEWIE: Won't you join us for dinner? DEATH: Oh, no. I don't want to impose. DEATH: Is that turkey? LOIS: Yes, Death. We were in the middle of a turkey dinner to celebrate Peter's good health. DEATH: Do you mind? STEWIE: Mind? Of course not. It would be an honor. No, it would be a privilege. Oh, dear. Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl. Come, come. You, heat up some gravy for our guest! My last helping of white meat was drier than Oscar Wilde. How did you do that? DEATH: Let's just say, when I was younger I did some films I'm not particularly proud of. DEATH: That does it for me. Wait! You can't go. After dinner, we usually go into the living room and live for another 40 or 50 years. DEATH: [Laughing.] 40 or Let's go. I guess this is good-bye. Meg, you're the man of the family now. Be strong. Daddy. Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here to see you become a man. Yes. I think we all know what that's going to be like. A 20-minute call to Larchmont? Who do we know in Larchmont? STEWIE'S WIFE: My sister-in-law. Yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes. That's right. How is Carol? - Brian. - Oh, God. - Daddy, can I come with you? - Ask your mother. No, you can't go with him! - Oh, Peter. - Lois. [Crying.] DEATH: Okay, that's good. Come on now. PETER: Hey, Death, you got a file on me? DEATH: Yeah, it's in the car, I think. Does it mention that I ran two weeks of Junior Varsity track? DEATH: Let's not do this. I caught Flo Jo. You don't think I can catch you? [Screaming.] DEATH: My ankle! DEATH: Yeah, listen, don't help or anything. I'm totally fine. Damn Irish. DEATH: Yeah. That felt good, dropping me on the couch like that. LOIS: Here's some Tylenol. DEATH: Great. Tylenol. I asked for Advil. But, you know, whatever. That's good. I got a B-plus in Health. Is there anything I can do? DEATH: Why don't you boil some water and rip up some sheets there, Einstein. It's a sprained ankle. DEATH: I have to stay off it for a while. PETER: Not here. DEATH: Why? PETER: You tried to kill me! Besides, how are we supposed to explain you to Mr. Roper? LOIS: It's okay, Death. You just worry about feeling better. What the hell are you doing? Peter, don't you see? As long as he's here, you can't die. PETER: Go on. LOIS: That's it. PETER: Wait a minute. So no matter what I do, I won't die? Make yourself at home, Death. PETER: I'm going out for a while. DEATH: Wait. You can't tell anyone I'm here. For if humanity discovers l'm no longer lurking in the shadows, consequences will be dire. PETER: Go on. DEATH: That's it. What the hell do you see in him? What the hell do you see in him? LOIS: Peter, where are you going? Lois, 10 minutes ago, I was staring Death in the face. Now that I've been given another chance l'm gonna do the one thing I've always dreamed of doing. I'm gonna jump off this building. Could you repeat that, please, Peter? I believe I had something crazy in my ear. Hold the phone. You took me away from a Swedish girlie-girl and her paralyzed, but trusting, cousin for this? - $1,000 says I live. - $1,000, huh? - What the hell? - Okay. Look at that. I beat my loogie. [Grumbling.] LOIS: It's your turn, Death. DEATH: I know I should find this ironic, but I'm just bored as hell. How old is this TV? You can probably get the DuMont Network on this thing. LOIS: Peter is a good man and a wonderful father. DEATH: Here it comes. Could you please find it in your heart to spare him? After all, it isn't really his time. DEATH: What did you use for this cocoa, crap? LOIS: If you want me to make it again DEATH: Sorry, my fault. I just assumed you were gonna make it with milk, not crap! LOIS: I'll be right back. MEG: I brought you a magazine. DEATH: Glamour, great. I can learn how to please my man. Go get me an Entertainment Weekly. I hear it's got a great picture of me sneaking up on Tom Snyder. [Suspenseful instrumental music.] [Screaming.] [Saw buzzing.] Victory is mine! Wow. I should really watch where I'm going. What the deuce? Of course! It seems with Death incapacitated, my matricidal efforts are futile. I must do all I can to accelerate his convalescence. ""Knick-knack paddywhack, give a dog a bone"" I can't believe you drank 300 bottles of beer without succumbing to alcohol poisoning. Peter, are you a witch? Yeah. But don't tell anyone. The consequences could be dire! You guys, I bet I can go up to each one of those scary-looking bikers and say: ""Aren't you Richard Simmons?"" - Peter, no! - Now you're being brainless. Aren't you Richard Simmons? Aren't you Richard Simmons' best friend, Richard Simmons? BIKER: Shut up! [Laughing.] [Everyone laughing.] DEATH: That feels good. Actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig. I really wanted to be a wood nymph. Man, the second Dad found out, he started in with the whole: ""I have no son. I have no son,"" and Mom just stood there. Yes. Mothers can be quite the botheration, can't they? That's why we've got to get you well. - What was that? - Nothing! Stewie, leave Death alone. DEATH: He's okay. He reminds me a lot of me at that age. I hope his teen years go better than mine. Boy, talk about awkward. DEATH: Oh, Sandy! Sandy! Sandy? Not again. I'm gonna be a virgin forever. Or am I? LOIS: Can we please talk about Peter? He has so much to live for, Death. He loves his children and me DEATH: Okay. I'll spare his life. But you owe me, if you get my drift. What the hell are you doing? I was talking about another fruit cup. Not bad, though. LOIS: Peter, Death just agreed to let you live. Oh, man. This really is my night. I get to live, and I'm on TV. Our top story tonight, the rules of death no longer apply. That's right, Tom. Our own Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa, filed this report, all by herself! I'm here with Peter Griffin, the man who claims he withstood a barrage of bullets and did not die. Peter, are you saying that if I shoot you in the head with this Channel 5 pistol, you'll be completely unharmed? Why don't you give it a shot? Okay, here goes. [Screaming.] What have I done? [Laughing.] You're awful. - Fascinating story, Tom. - It sure is, Diane. And since the laws of death no longer apply, I can do this. That's right, Tom. And now it's time for sports. DEATH: The whole world is laughing at me. This is high school all over again. Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them! Oh, my God, that hurts! You're not killing anyone tonight, mister! Not on that ankle. DEATH: This is all your fault. And there's only one solution. You have to go out there and do my job. You have to be Death! [Dramatic instrumental music.] PETER: Boy, this doesn't leave much to the imagination. Death, there is no way Peter can do your job. He could never kill anyone. Yeah! I've thought about it, like in church and stuff but I don't think I could ever do what you do. DEATH: So you're better than me? I'm tired of always being the bad guy. What I do has to be done. He's right. You've disturbed the natural order. People need to be able to die. [Sentimental instrumental music.] No! - Actually, I think I'm gonna be okay. - Oh, Jack. Now we can get married and everything you promised. Yeah, about that I was pretty sure I was gonna die because there's this girl in New York, and it's getting kind of serious. But thanks for letting me draw you naked. I still can't believe you let me do that! You're saying the only way to make the world right is for me to kill someone? STEWIE: You could kill Lois. DEATH: No. One death isn't gonna do it. You have to do something that will get everyone's attention, something huge. How about if you blow up the earth? DEATH: Too huge. But you're thinking. I like that. You could kill any girls who are prettier than me. DEATH: That would just leave England. Wait. I have it. I'm a genius. You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek! I knew it! As soon as that show came on the air, I said: ""I'm gonna be the one who has to kill these kids."" LOIS: It's true. He did say it. DEATH: Hot, young celebrities. It's perfect! The kids are on their way to LA to renegotiate their contracts. But their plane is gonna be making a little stopover in Rhode Island. DEATH: If you go now, you'll catch them. PETER: No way. I'm not doing your dirty work. There's no way I'm getting on that plane. Absolutely no way, and that's final. See? I'm still here. There's nothing you can say that'll change my mind. DEATH: You kill them, or I kill you. Crap! Nice plant. Note to self, do not go to the bathroom. MAN: James, your last movie killed at the box office. Your Q-rating's through the roof. It's time we ditched the WB and concentrate on features. I don't know who you are, but just because you're sitting across from me doesn't mean you can give me career advice. - Will you sign my ass? - You have a pen? Hello, Death? Guess where I'm calling from? PETER: A plane! DEATH: That's great. DEATH: Are those kids on board? PETER: Yeah. About that, I don't think I can go through with it. DEATH: Peter, listen, without death, the world would be a terrible place. Imagine a world where Hitler was still alive. ANNOUNCER: Today on Hitler, we'll be talking with Christian Slater. Now, they tell me in your next movie, we get to see your butt. [Girls cheering.] SLATER: Yes, you do. HITLER: Can we see it right now? SLATER: All right. HITLER: He's going to do it! ANNOUNCER: If you're going to be in L.A. And would like tickets to Hitler call 213-du werdest eine Krankenschwester brauchen! DEATH: Peter, all you gotta do is sit there. The plane is gonna crash in LA. Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies. PETER: Jeez, everybody? DEATH: Except you. Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda? PETER: It's still me. DEATH: Brenda? PETER: Yes? Just kidding, it's still me. PILOT: We now begin our final approach into Los Angeles International. If you look out the window, you'll see the San Fernando Valley where my brother Gary makes a very nice living directing porn. We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes. GIRLS: [Singing.] ""We like being alive, we like being alive ""We like being, oh, we like being, oh, we like being alive"" I guess it's their time. [Theme from Dawson's Creek playing.] PACEY: Boy, for a teacher, you sure make love good. Actually, it's ""well,"" Pacey. You mean to say, I make love ""well."" - You're good to go again, right? - Yeah. DEATH: Peter? Hello? Peter, are you there? I can hear you breathing? Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it. I've changed my mind. I don't care if you do kill me, I'm not gonna kill those kids. If they die, I'll have nothing to watch on Wednesdays other than the fine programs on Fox. Open up in there! What are you doing? You're not a pilot. I know every pilot in the world! I'm here to keep you from making an error. A pilot error. Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens! JAMES: Nice going, fat I was just trying to save your lives. But now you're all gonna die. - No one can land this plane. - I can. Thank God! It's Karen Black! She landed a busted plane in Airport '75? It was a movie in the '70s. You damn kids with your music. TOM: Both of the pilots were killed. Fortunately for the other passengers, actress Karen Black star of such films as Nashville and Five Easy Pieces, was on board. Hats off to Miss Black for proving once again that, given the opportunity actresses over 50 can land large aircraft. Karen Black. What an obscure reference! DEATH: What the hell? I told you to waste the Dawson's Creek kids. LOIS: You're missing the important thing here. You said you wanted everyone to know the rules of death apply. LOIS: Now the whole world does. DEATH: I guess so. My ankle's starting to feel better. I should probably get out of your hair. But you just got here! We can stay in touch, can't we? What's your e-mail? Mine is ""loismustdie,"" all one word, ""@yahoo.com."" PETER: Wait a second. Death? I used to fear you, but now I'm glad we met. Because you've given me a great gift. The complete Boz Scaggs. PETER: How did you know? DEATH: I just had a feeling. LOIS: We're gonna miss you, Death. DEATH: Don't worry. I'll be back really, really soon. [Laughing.] DEATH: Is he joking? Okay, see you later.

Rescue workers got the fish out of the water but unfortunately it died shortly after. Diane? Tom, another life was tragically cut short today. Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater group known as the Quahog Players passed away this afternoon. Oh, my God!

[Singing.] ""La la la la la, Miss Saigon ""La la la la la, Miss Saigon"" Yes, I just heard. It's so sad. Really? They want me to be the new artistic director of the Quahog Players! - All right, Mom! - Are you gonna do it? I don't know. It's such a big responsibility. I need a moment to think. Okay, I'll do it. This just in. Lois Griffin is named the new artistic director of the Quahog Players. All those years of paying my dues as musical director under that old hack have finally paid off. Lois, congratulations. Our little theater group finally has a committed visionary at its helm. And such an attractive one. Brian, you'll have to audition just like everyone else. God, of course. I You didn't think You thought I was Lois! - I can paint scenery. - Can I be in the show, Mom? Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager who stays backstage and cries because nobody finds her attractive. [Laughing.] - Hey, you guys. - Peter, guess what? I am gonna Me first! Mr. Weed said whoever comes up with the best idea for the big Christmas toy this year gets a huge bonus. Hey, Dad, why don't you invent the Frisbee? That's an awesome toy. - It's already been invented. - Then how come I never heard of it? This is my chance to prove how valuable I am to the company! Sorry, Lois. What's your news? Well, I Mr. Weed, distinguished members of the board may I present this year's hottest toy Mr. Zucchini Head. He's got stupid cool hip-hop style with his little hat and his Doc Martens. Thank you, Peter, that's enough. Wait. This is the best part! He dances! MAN #1: I've seen enough. MAN #2: Inappropriate. MAN #3: I haven't had sex in ages. Gentlemen, I apologize for wasting your time. Peter is an adequate assembly-line worker but you'll be happy to know our company does not pay him to think. [Laughing.] [Nervous laughter.] I'll take this. No calls. Come on, kids! The director can't be late for the auditions. You should've heard them laughing at me. I got great ideas, but they look at me, and all they see is a loser. Except that guy with the lazy eye. He sees a loser and the snack machine. Peter, a lot of creative people had mindless jobs. Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry. Herman Melville was a customs agent. Albert Einstein worked for the patent office. And what is it you want to patent, Herr Smith? I call it ""Smith's Theory of Relativity."" - Hey, look at this. - What? BRIAN: I think Lois is saying that you have to find a way to express yourself creatively. For example, Chris has his drawing, Meg does her birdcalls, I sing beautifully. So I've heard. And Lois has her theater group. Yes. And for my first production, I've chosen The King and I. It's a wonderful story about a loving, patient woman who introduces culture and civility to a barbaric, patriarchal Peter, please don't wipe your nose on the couch. Look, I have to go. Part of being creative is figuring out what you're good at. I know you can do it if you put your mind to it. You're right. Man was meant to create. That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks. It works! Look how tiny they are! [Sweeping instrumental music.] [Singing.] ""Oh, no not in springtime ""summer, winter, or fall ""No, never would I leave you ""at all"" JOE: Bravo! LOIS: Brian, that was beautiful! Thank you! No, thank you. And that note you gave me, ""louder,"" I was thinking that, and then you said it. BRIAN: You're so intuitive. It's a pleasure LOIS: Okay. Next! Stewie, do you want to try out for Mommy's play? ""Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York. - ""And all"" - Why don't you sing Itsy Bitsy Spider? How dare you reduce my finely hewn thespian stylings to mere Mother Gooseries! Sing Baa Baa Black Sheep! Mother, as first lady of the American stage, Helen Hayes, once said: ""I'm going to kill you!"" Hey, can somebody give me a hand with all this talent? Peter, what are you doing here? Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity, like you said. First I took an art class. Am I supposed to draw the penis? Then I tried sculpting. Am I supposed to sculpt the penis? Then I tried music. Am I supposed to conduct with my penis? I started to think there was nothing I'd be good at. But then I realized that this is it. Lois, my penis belongs on stage. Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition. You know, sing, dance. [Laughs.] I get it. Hello, everybody. This is just a formality, since I happen to be doing the director. [Laughs.] Five, six, seven, eight. [Sings out of tune.] ""Marshall, Will, and Holly, on a routine expedition ""Met the greatest earthquake ever known ""High on the rapids, it struck their tiny raft [Yells.] ""And plunged them down a thousand feet below ""to the Land of the Lost"" [Growls.] LOIS: Before I post the cast list my choreographer and I want to thank everyone for auditioning. - You were all great. - Weren't they? I only wish the show was called The King and Us so I could cast you all. [Laughing.] Anna! Baby, baby! I'm a star! Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before. Except for Pearl Bailey at a book signing once but then we later found out it wasn't actually her. Siamese baby? Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts! You wanted a bigger part, didn't you, sweetie? To hell with you! Perhaps I'll skip the stage and go directly to films! - Hello. - What is that on your ear? Is that hair gel? - Yeah. - Great, 'cause I could use some. - No, don't! - I just ran out. [Sighing.] Man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp! BRIAN: The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead! This is so unexpected! Hey, shut up! The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead! PETER: Lois, I think you made a mistake. I'm not ""The King."" I'm not ""I,"" I'm not anybody. - So, what? I had sex with you for nothing? - No, Peter, I It's just that directing this show is a big opportunity for me and I don't want anything to ruin it. - Ruin it? - Yes. By not using you to your full potential. You have too much talent for the stage. You should [Stuttering.] You should be a producer. A producer? Gee, I don't know. PETER: Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr. We made the deal. We're richer and more powerful than ever! I'm the king of the [Screams.] PETER: Damn it! [Gentle dinner music playing.] I love Mexicans. I'll do it! [Pianist playing show music.] JOE: Hang on, hang on! You overextended the plié! You screwed it all up. Let me show you again. Okay, boys! Let's do it! And one, two, three. And just like this. And watch my feet. And one, two, three. Peter, Chris says you told him to build a set for the North Pole. Yeah, that's where Anna goes to talk with her best friend, a penguin. There is no talking penguin in The King and I. There is in ""Peter Griffin presents The King and I."" What? Now we gotta think of some funny stuff for him to say. Peter, the director decides whether or not to add a character. You're the producer, remember? What am I supposed to do with all my great ideas? Put 'em in a tub and clean myself with them? 'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois. Good producers put their ideas to work outside the theater. It's your job to make sure we sell every seat in this house. - And that's creative? - Is it? Well, it's just the most creative job there is. Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out. I'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends and that's, like, 10 people right there. Hey, I recognize you from the television. You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this. PETER: Excuse me? TOM: You. Get out of here! Get out of here! Go on, get out of here! - Wow! Diane Simmons! - You don't look anything like the ad. - You better be huge. - No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer. I'm presenting ""Peter Griffin presents The King and l"" a Peter Griffin production, and I'm giving you the exclusive story. Look, pal, some two-bit community theater production isn't news. Who's the star? For that matter, who the hell are you, and why should I give a damn? Wow, I'm being interviewed by Diane Simmons! Well, Lois, you told me to produce, and I did. I got us a story on the 11:00 news. - Really? - Peter. Our top story tonight. I will be playing the role of Anna in the Quahog Players production of The King and I. - Tom? - Thanks, Diane. In other news, I'm not going to the play because I'm sure it'll be lousy. I'm getting late word that you're a petty, jealous, closet case. Bit of breaking news. We now go live to Diane being a bitch. Diane? But Loretta's playing Anna, and she's doing a great job. Loretta's a nobody. Diane Simmons is a star. You wanted me to sell tickets, right? People who've never been in a theater will come see Diane Simmons. I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter. Some of our greatest actors started in news, like Sean Penn. Today's weather calls for breezy skies and sun, and there's gonna be a Get that camera out of my face! PETER: Hey, everybody, here's our star! This is so awkward. You all know my name, and I've never heard of any of you. - You ever acted before, honey? - I did an independent film in college. [Melancholic instrumental music.] LOIS: Let's start with the scene where Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king. - Are you playing Lady Thiang? - I was supposed to be Anna. They did an all-you-people version of Hello, Dolly that was very successful. Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7. Action! ""Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you. You must go to him. ""Lady Thiang, if he needs me, truly needs me, I will go to him."" Cut! All wrong! No good! Peter, what are you doing? She was wonderful. My ass. Besides, I'm the director. It just doesn't feel real, you know? Anna and Miss Thing both love the king, right? On Springer yesterday, they had ""I won't share my husband"" and these two women bitch-slapped each other. The crowd went nuts. - Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane? - I think I can do that. Wait a minute. Nobody's slapping anybody. This is Rodgers and Hammerstein, not trash TV! I think Peter may be onto something. Springer is one of our station's highest-rated shows. - I don't know. - I thought you wanted to do a good show? - I don't know. - I thought you wanted to do a good show? If you want to do a bad show, why don't we just do Rent? I guess we can try that - Action! Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts make Diane look a little hippie, you know? I thought we could dress her in a pair of sequined capri pants. They didn't have capri pants in the 1860s. They did now! STEWIE: You! You are the worst thing to happen to musical theater since Andrew Lloyd Webber! And you! I just plain don't like you! [Laughing.] LOIS: What's going on? We're just having a little pow-wow to discuss my latest changes. What changes? The Siamese children. How about this? They're not children. They're aliens! QUAGMIRE: That was great. BRIAN: On the money. Isn't he brilliant? No! He's not brilliant! Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant! And I want to do the show they wrote! We're not making any more changes! MEG: We sold out! Yeah. The whole town's talking about your show, Dad! [Cheering.] Your show? Peter, this is my show! What's the big deal? You wanted to sell out, and we did. I am through selling out. I took this job because I wanted to create something beautiful and you've completely destroyed that! You want to be the director? Fine! I quit! Me, direct? I don't know what to say, except, ""I'm the king of the"" Morning, theater fans! Good morning, Peter. I made your favorite breakfast. - What the hell is this? - French toast. I just made a few creative changes to the recipe. I think it's a lot better now. Lois, if this is your idea of a joke, you must write for Leno. It is so fashionable to take a shot at Jay Leno. Look, the fact is the man is out there every bloody night with fresh material and he's charming. Face it, you're just jealous because people like my ideas better than yours. I don't care if the whole world loves your ideas. That doesn't make them good. I was trying to make art. Art-schmart. Put enough monkeys in a room with a typewriter they'll produce Shakespeare. Let's see. ""A something by any other name"" - ""Carnation,"" ""peony."" - No, they did that on last week's Marlowe. - What about ""daisy""? - ""Chrysanthemum""! - ""Iris,"" ""rose""? What about ""rose""? - Did you say ""rose""? - Yeah, ""rose."" - ""Rose"" is good! - ""A rose by any other name."" That works. - I like that a lot. - Moving on. - What about ""tulip""? ""Rose"" is fine. Moving on. Peter, you've never done a creative thing in your life! That's not true. I wrote Bonfire of the Vanities. No, you didn't. You win this round, Lois. You're not being creative. You're just destroying a wonderful show. I have more creativity in my whole body than most people do before 9:00 a.m. The only thing you create before 9:00 a. M is exactly what you've turned my show into. I think my work will speak for itself. [Fake laugh.] I just got that. A poop joke? That's real creative, Lois. PETER: Okay, let's run this scene again. Remember, Diane, you're playing Anna, a steel-town girl on a Saturday night looking for the fight of her life. - Where does it say that? - In my noodle. Okay, places. And action! ['80s pop music playing in theater.] PETER: Stop! All wrong! All wrong! God, send me dancers. We've been rehearsing for hours. I'm exhausted! I'm sorry, but we open this show in three hours and I don't think we're ready! DIANE: No, we're not! You keep changing everything! You bet I do! Because theater is alive. It's a living, breathing creature with wants and needs and you're not man enough to satisfy her! - I can't work this way. I quit! - Fine. - We can't do The King and I without Anna. - Yeah. This is a real snafu. We don't need Diane Simmons. We've had someone better all along. Someone radiant and sassy with the soul and passion that can only come from hundreds of years of black oppression. Thank you, Peter. I'll do it. Get over yourself. I was talking about me. Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio. STAGEHAND: Two minutes, everybody. PETER: Jeez, full house. Look who came crawling back. Peter, have you seen my wheelchair? I don't get it, Mom. If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your show, why'd you come to opening night? I came because I love the theater. If I just came here to enjoy watching your father be humiliated when this asinine spectacle of his is ridiculed by everyone in town what kind of person would I be? A bitch. PETER: Siam, 2015 AD. The city lies in ruins after the ninth nuclear World War. It is a grim future with lots of explosions and partial nudity. A future where an oppressive new king has seized power. Only one man can stop him. No, one machine. I am an Automaton Nuclear Neo-human Android. You may call me ANNA. I am a robot ninja from the planet England who is here to destroy you and free this land from your tyranny. I have been expecting you, ANNA. Let me introduce my Siamese children. [Sultry instrumental music.] I will not be swayed by your attempts to confuse my programming with your all-female sex orgy. - We must kung fu fight! - So be it, ANNA. [Kung fu fighting noises.] I have slain the evil emperor. I hereby proclaim Siam the United States of America. ALL: [Singing.] ""ANNA rules ""Because I kicked all the bad guys in their jewels ALL: ""ANNA won ""Thanks to my gamma-ray atomic gun ALL: ""Dance and shout ""'He's the world's greatest ninja, there's no doubt ""Though they tried to defeat me ""they can all just freakin' eat me ""Because he blew all of us away ALL: ""In the planet of Siam, there's no one as tough as I am ""Just as surely as Paul Lynde was gay"" [Heroic instrumental music.] [Crowd cheering.] Oh, my God! They liked it? Stop it! Stop clapping right now! What's wrong with you? These people shouldn't be encouraged! They should be punished! That man has committed murder here this evening and the victim's name is ""theater."" This is the kind of mind-numbing schlock that's turning our society into a cultural wasteland! This isn't art! This isn't even entertainment! This blows! [Gasps.] [Farting.] [Continues farting.] [Laughing.] [Cheering.] See? This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about. - How was the cast party? - We're a hit. Man, what a night. I got to see my ideas come to life. It's the greatest feeling in the world. - Yeah, I bet it is. - And it's all thanks to you. I never would've discovered I could be creative if you hadn't believed in me. Actually I didn't really, not at first. But anyone who could take The King and I and turn it into that is well, he's gotta be creative. Yeah, Lois, sorry I took your show away from you but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure you get your chance next year. It'll be ""Peter Griffin presents a Lois Griffin production."" - Okay, honey? - Deal. [Peter chuckling.] PETER: Were you there when I farted? [Theme music.]"

I guess now we know what kind of dog he is. A melan-collie. (laughs) Nothing? Oh, wait, wait, wait.|I should have said ""Chi-wah-wah"". I don't have to (bleep) impress you. Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois. But why do we have to cancel our cruise|just cos the dog's a cokehead? We're not going on vacation while Brian's|in rehab. We'll just have to wait till next year. Aw, man! I'll make it up to you.|My cousin works at Club Med. (sings ""Hot Hot Hot"" by Arrow) Holy crap! Look at this place. This is where God would come|if he had to stop doin' blow. - They have tennis courts!|- And a full spa! Wow! No wonder people do drugs! Good luck, Brian. I just know|you're gonna get clean. Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with|all these mineral baths and jacuzzis. Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun|and everyone wets themselves. I give you gold and I get squat.|I'll be in the car. That was a very productive first day, Brian. Our goal here is to find your X factor - the element in your life|that made you turn to drugs. Just having some time away to sort things|out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor. What are you doing here? I'm on vacation. Oh, and if|anyone asks, I'm also on smack. Peter, this is a detox clinic.|You can't vacation here. Why not? This place is|way better than a cruise. I whipped this speedfreak's ass|at horseshoes today. This isn't a vacation for me.|I'm tryin' to get healthy. Yeah, OK. All right. Hey, softball this afternoon. Us addicts are takin' on the pregnant|teenagers from across the lake. OK, come on, everyone. Exercise|is an important part of recovery. Just work with the resistance of the water.|Ten more reps. And one. And two. And three. Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!

Yeah. Yeah. Peter Griffin. Oh, crap. I was lookin' for you. You wanna go mess|with the pregnant teens across the lake? I can't. Group therapy. I saw one of those - more borin' than when|I was a security guard for George Harrison. (Peter sings along to|theme from ""Charles in Charge"") (glass smashes, thud) Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Quiet down up there! You wacky Beatle. I have made a lot of progress lately. Missing|one session wouldn't be the end of the world. There you go. - What do you think they put in the bug juice?|- Bugs? No, they don't! Come on. (uncertainly) Shut up. (girls scream, popping sounds, babies cry) I hope you're proud of yourselves.|14 premature births. Sorry. I don't usually let Peter|talk me into this kinda stuff. You have a pre-existing relationship|with this degenerate? A degenerate, am I? Well, you are a fastizio. See? I can make up words too, sister. - Well, I think we've found your X factor.|- You mean Peter? His behaviour is a negative influence on you.|With your intelligence and sensitivity Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.|I made my own mistakes. All right? This man took me into his home|and treated me like family. - He's my best friend.|- And look where you've ended up. You know, I think my therapy|here is complete. I came here to get clean|and I did. So goodbye. Brian, it's moments like this that make me|sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do. ""He was all coked up and we were choked up ""But now we're happy Brian's home,|cha-cha-cha! I am serious, Lois.|You could be in show business. - Hey, Meg. 18 yet?|- No. - Chris, how are ya?|- I'm glad All right! Brian, I feel guilty. If not for me,|you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk. Joe, if I've learned anything|from my experience, it's that we're all responsible|for our own destiny. - And that's why I'm leaving.|- Leavin'? You can't leave. I have to, Peter. For me.

You're washing a baby's hair, not|scrubbing vomit off your Christmas dress. - We got a letter from Brian.|- Tell him I'm not here. - Let me see.|- Argh! Argh! Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.|There. All better? You are some piece of work, lady.|If you Actually, yes, it is. ""Greetings from California.|I've been very busy."" ""Having a great time trying|to make it as a writer in LA."" ""It's as easy as everyone thinks it is."" ""I've been working the room|at a lot of Hollywood parties."" Oh! Bobby! Loved you in Raging Bull. Hey, Jodie, how's the baby? All right. I need more cheese puffs. Oprah's off the|wagon. No toothpicks. She'll hurt herself. Did you hear about Jason?|Paramount bought his script. - They bought Death Spares Not the Tiger?|- 100 grand. Pretty good, huh? Sheesh. He's been in LA|how long? Unbelievable. You know he actually called the main|character John Everyman? Come on. Well, good for him. (inhales deeply) Keanu Reeves. Wow. I don't usually gush, so forgive me, but when|I was writing Coastguard Oh, I'm a writer. When I was writing Coastguard,|I couldn't think of anyone other than - There's a woodpecker on your head.|- Yeah, he comes and goes. ("" musical intro) Now back to ""Kids Say the Darndest Things"". It's OK. Take your time. Then what happened? He said he would kill me|if I ever said anything. - Do you remember what he looked like?|- Yeah. He had a scar on his arm and he had a big, stupid, doo-doo head. A big, stupid, doo-doo head! (audience laughs) Oh, honestly, the things|these children come up with. If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get|a trip to LA, have them try out for our show. Next auditions in New York|and Quahog, Rhode Island. - Maybe Stewie could get on that show.|- You must be shrooming. Yeah! We can get a free trip|to LA and see Brian. Jeez, I haven't been to California|since I lived with my other family. Guys, I just got invited to a party|at Sharon Tate's house! You guys can come, but you gotta|promise not to embarrass me. Talk! I know you've been plotting|to foil my plans of world domination. Who are you working for?|The Libyans? The French? Very well. If torture won't work,|perhaps a little tenderness will. Mm, I like your taste in women. Yes, she and I|are going to have a good time together. Yes, you like this, don't you? Oh, God. Look at me having sex|with a pig. I've become my father. Stewie, let's get your sailor suit. You gotta look cute|to audition for national TV. Lois, I told you. There's no way National TV, you say? Coast to coast? That could be the ideal place to unleash my|hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public. I always loved this little sailor suit.|Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater. Or you could make yourself useful|and wipe my button - circular motion. And don't you look at me! Oh, my God. That's Michael Eisner.|I'll take it from here, Julio. Here you go, Mr Eisner. It's been Brian-ised. You might notice that new-script smell. Every car I hand-wash|comes with a smile, an air freshener, and a copy of my coming-of-age|teen comedy set in Wisconsin. - What's your name?|- Brian. Let's see. There we go. Brian. See you at Disneyland. Bring money. Look. It's Tom Tucker from the news.|And that must be his son. - Oh, my.|- I feel bad staring without having got a ticket. How can I follow that act?|Bite the head off a chicken? - Dad, they're staring at me.|- They're just jealous. (shudders) - You're next.|- Wait. We were next. Hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me! Hey! (sighs) You know what we'll do? We'll get|the video camera and make our own show. - I don't wanna.|- Yes, you do. You do because it's normal. Tell us, Stewie. What job does a mommy do? Interesting question.|More to the point, how does one define ""job"" without branding oneself with useless|labels? I'm sorry. I'm afraid I answered|your question with another question. Um How old do you think Daddy is? Oh. I mean, Daddy's old. I think he's seven. (all laugh) That's it. That's what you want to hear.|Yes, jump through the hoop. Daddy's feet smell. Jackasses. (laughing) Mr and Mrs Griffin, he's adorable. Congratulations.|Stewie's gonna be on the show. Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood,|where people are sexy and clever and always say somethin' funny|before the commercial break. Great. I always end up|sitting next to a damn baby. What did you just say? - Stewie, stop fussing.|- Not now, Lois. Turn around. If you've got|something to say, say it to my face. Oh, you can't hear me now? That's it. I was going to watch the movie,|but forget it. You're now my bitch. Wah! Wah! My ears are popping|and there's no way to console me. I'm hungry and possibly teething.|Maybe I'm wet. Who knows? I'm a baby. Wah! Wah! (answerphone) This is a message|for Brian. This is Jack Nicholson. Listen, I read your script|and it just jumped right off the page. I think it's something I'd be excited|to be a part of, so call my (man bursts out laughing) Listen, I'm just jackin'you. Me and my buddy|Phil just found your script at Starbucks. - (Phil) Tell him it sucks.|- Yeah, it sucks. Give it up, loser, and don't put|your number on the cover, you stupid (Phil laughs) I'm hungry. - (phone rings)|- Jasper's residence. - Who the hell is Jasper? Where's Brian?|- Peter? It's me. Jasper's my cousin. I'm using his place. He's working|at Club Med. Are you on a cell? - Yeah, we're in LA.|- What? W-What a terrific surprise. - Brian, can we see you for dinner?|- Yeah, you're not too famous to see us? Well, I was invited to the premiere|of the new, uh the new Val Kilmer picture,|but I'd rather take you out to dinner. - How about Musso & Frank's at eight?|- OK. See ya later, Mr Big Shot Crap. I didn't push ""End"".|This is gonna cost me a fortune. Brian! I'm back. Tell me everything.|I'm sitting, I'm hearing. That's Ricardo. Ricardo, Brian.|He doesn't speak English. Can I? Mm-mm. Catching up. OK, me first. I'm in love.|Ooh, too much dressing. He's from the Philippines.|I know - I'm a rice queen. - How's the writing thingy going?|- Terrible. I can't get my foot in the door. I have somebody you have to meet.|He's a producer. He's great. Really? Thanks. That'd be great. - D'you like sex and the city?|- It's an OK show. I wasn't talking about the show.|Ooh! I'm nasty. (imitates ship's horn)|Someone send me out to sea. It says here this is the gutter|where the policeman fell over laughing after Eddie Murphy said he was just|giving the transvestite a ride home. - (ringing)|- Oh, I think that's me. - Hello.|- Hey, Peter. It's Quagmire. - Hey, Quagmire.|- Last night I had sex with a black chick. Uh uh I gotta go. - Sorry.|- What? All he said was ""black chick"". I know, but your boyfriend looks like|one of your typical angry black guys. Hey, we cool, G?|Yuh? Yuh? Yuh? All right. Halle Berry would be perfect as the camp|counsellor all the kids wanna ""get with"". Jasper was right. You're very talented. I'm having a brainstorm.|Ever thought about directing? - Just every waking hour!|- Well, I got this movie. It's a low-budget movie,|but the script is solid. My director quit and I need somebody who's|smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth. Well, I am smart and ambitious! - Seriously.|- I'm clean. Musso & Frank's is famous.|See the bar over there? - Great writers like Hemingway drank there.|- Where'd that guy who wrote Porky's drink? Oh, man, when that fat broad grabbed|that kid's crank through the hole. Where do they get their ideas?|You're the writer. You tell me. Oh, boy. This is great. All that searching,|that emptiness I felt back home, gone. - I've finally found my life's calling.|- How wonderful. I've always found your writing|a little hackneyed and stilted, but I guess that's why I'm not|workin' out here in Hollywood, huh? - Oh, congratulations on all your success.|- Uh, thank you. - Know what might be a thrill for you guys?|- Ooh! Eating a pebble! Yes, but I was talking about|stopping by the set to see me in action. - Brian, could we really?|- You do know somebody in the business. I'm in the business too, you know.|I'm going to be on television. - Great.|- And when I make my appearance, - you'll all be talking about it the next day.|- Good luck with that. ""Good luck with that."" Yutz. (ringing) - (woman) Hello. Peter Griffin?|- You're in him. Are you happy with|your long-distance service? Yes, and I'm tired of you people|always calling during dinner. - Give me your supervisor.|- Hold, please. ("" ""Looks Like We Made It"" by Barry Manilow) Oh, Peter, I love this song.|Open your mouth. ("" song gets louder) Brian. Right on time. I like that. Come in. So, ready to shoot your first scene? - Sure. Where's the set?|- Second door on your left. - So, this is a shampoo commercial, right?|- Do I have to sleep with the dog in this one? Can someone fluff Paul?|He's got a windsock thing goin' on. So, this is a shampoo commercial, right? Zack, I'm sorry.|There's just no way I can do this. I've been around.|I've licked my share of peanut butter. But I think you need|to find yourself a new director. - Are you sure?|- I just can't do this. Is this any more degrading than|washing cars? Here you can be creative. I wanna make this perfectly clear. There is|absolutely no way I would consider doing it. - Unless I saw a script first.|- Of course. - This isn't bad.|- It's like Bang the Drum Slowly, except the drum's a chick. (honking) Peter, slow down. Brian said|he was gonna be on the set all day. ""On the set""! Listen to me. Two days in|Hollywood and I sound like a contract player. (siren) Oh, crap. The LAPD. Argh! Ow! Argh! Ow! Come on, Peter. I wanna save some tape|for the Hollywood sign. - OK. Hey, thanks a lot, you guys.|- Our pleasure. Have a nice vacation, sir. Ooh! (woman, breathily) Yes yes yes Cut. OK, nice take, Jenna, but let's try|giving the lines a little subtext this time. Your husband's always away on business|and you feel isolated and unloved, so you begin to think maybe|you should go back to graduate school. That's when you notice|the cable man has no pants on. Wow, a real movie set.|Hey, this house looks kinda familiar. I'll bet Samuel L Jackson is here.|He's in everything. There's Brian! All right, Samuel, when you lay her down,|I want you to enter from Oh, my God! - Hey, you guys.|- Hey, Brian. Can I be in the movie? The Jacuzzi girl didn't show. How long|can you hold your breath under water? - Real long. One time at Hatch Pond|- No, absolutely not. You gotta leave. - Get these people out.|- Now you're a director, we embarrass you? - No, no I mean, yes.|- Does anyone else smell Astroglide? You're gonna look so handsome. Look at these crow's-feet. God. You stay up|past 7.30 and you pay for it in the morning. - Who the hell does Brian think he is?|- Maybe he thought we'd get in the way. It's not the first time|you've disrupted a performance. - (crowd gasps)|- Oh, jeez. Oh, God. I didn't see it. It jumped right out in front of my car.|Oh, I am so sorry. We just have to face it. Brian's a Hollywood|director, and we're small-town people. - All right, one more. Uh, Rob Lowe?|- Straight. - No!|- Yes. - Stop.|- Ho-hum. - Pull over.|- Absolutely. - Oh, well, he hides it well.|- He wishes. (applause) Stewie. That's a funny name. Stewie. - It's like stew, only with an ""ie!"" at the end.|- (laughter) - Hm.|- I meant it's funny, Stewie. I had an uncle named Stewie,|and he used to sell bicycles. Aren't you supposed to be|asking me a question? What do you think candies are made out of? Sunshine and farts. What a silly question. I love candy. When I was a little boy|we would play stickball. No, no, I'll wait. Oh, you finished? Sorry. I thought the name of the show|was Kids Say the Darndest Things, not Old Black Comedians|Never Shut the Hell Up. - Ask me what I want to be when I grow up.|- And we also used to play buck-buck. Enough of your blether. Good evening, world.|From this moment on, I will be your (chuckles) What you got there?|Oh, you're gonna go skiing now? Give that back. They're of no use to you. Oh, I'm going down the mountain.|Coo-coo-cachoo. No! Don't listen to him. That's not funny. That's just saying|what happens when you go skiing. Here I go, down the slope. Ooh, I'm goin' zip-zop, zooba-de-bop. Stop it. Stop applauding him.|He's not even using real words any more. We'll be back with a girl from Atlanta|who skips rope with her sister's pigtails. Coo-coo! - No, my segment's not over!|- Come on, you like to jump rope, don't ya? - I like jump rope.|- So you're gonna sit here and enjoy it. I'm gonna sit here and enjoy it.|And I like pudding. And Ghost Dad was the best movie|I've seen since Leonard Part 6. (applause) - Good news.|- What? More people I love think I'm a jerk? You're more than that, Mr ""Nominated|for an Adult Movie Award for Director"". - A Woody? I'm up for a Woody?|- Call your family. They'll be proud of you. I'd rather they think I'm a jerk|than a smut pedlar. They'll love you even if you made|a couple of crappy movies. Blythe Danner still loves Gwyneth Paltrow.|Oops! Score one for me. Welcome back to E's Adult Video Awards|Pre-show. It's a good crowd tonight, Mom. It sure is, Melissa.|All the studs and sluts are arriving. - Brian. Brian!|- Oh, hey. You're nominated for three films|you directed yesterday. Add Mama to the Train,|The Purple Head of Cairo and, uh - What was the third one?|- You've Got Male Genitalia. I was asked to star in a porno, but I couldn't|cos most of my body's less than 18 years old. - I used to guest-host The Tonight Show.|- Oh, yeah. What was that, 30 years ago? Your mike isn't plugged in. - You're not even on TV right now, are you?|- In my mind. (wails) The next award is for Best Original Score in|an adult film. The nominees are: Ron Jones. ("" Muzak) Walter Murphy. ("" Muzak) And John Williams. ("" vibrant classical piece) You've come a long way|from hiding from the vacuum cleaner. - Lois!|- Hey, buddy. How are ya, Alfred Hitch Cock? You like that one, Dick Hertz? Huh?|I'm sorry. I'm already drunk. - How did you guys know I'd|- Jasper called. - Why didn't you tell us?|- I thought you'd be ashamed of me. No! I oughta knock you out|for not bringing me here sooner. The pair on that one's|bigger than your head. - So you guys aren't offended by this?|- I can't say I approve but we love you. If this is what makes you happy,|we support you. My God. I thought I needed to get away from|you guys to find what was missing in my life, but the only thing I'm missing is my family. How could I have become involved|in this degrading business? (awards host) And the award goes to|Brian Griffin. Whoo! Whoo! Oh, wow. My God. Oh! This is unexpected. I wanna thank my incredible team, who've been with me from Shaving|Private Ryan to Welcome to my Face. He lives with us back in Quahog. You got a nice wiggle, baby. You wanna be|in a movie? A little girl-girl action maybe? - Oh Peter!|- Good luck, buddy. I've been barking up that tree for 17 years. Wow. That was a wonderful trip, and|everyone has something to remember it by.

(gasps) My God. It all makes sense now. My baby is some kind of diabolical genius|bent on world domination! Bravo, Lois. The last horse|finally crosses the finish line. All these months I should've been paying|attention to what you've been saying. You're an evil child. Why? Why did I have to go and smoke pot|when I was pregnant with you? Cheer up. Be proud. You've given birth|to the future emperor of the world. Pity you won't be around|to enjoy it. Cheerio. Aaagh! - Lois! Lois!|- Huh? Hm? - What's the matter?|- I just had the strangest dream. Something about Stewie|and Cheerios It's gone. Come on, get up.|It's opening day for the Sox. Hey, Chris, Meg! We're going to Fenway! You can't pull the kids out of school|for a baseball game. Nothing they learn in school|they can't learn on the street. - It's 3 o'clock. Where the hell is Louie?|- You tell me. Louie left his house at 2.15|and has to travel a distance of 6.2 miles at a rate of five miles per hour.|What time will Louie arrive? - Depends if he stops to see his ho.|- That's called a variable. - Look what I made for the game.|- What's that mean anyway? - ""And the Lord said 'Go, Sox.""'|- Dad, don't you have to work today?

Hm. - Peter?|- Oh Hi, Mr Weed. - It seems you've made a full recovery.|- Oh, yeah. Yeah. That plane crash I told you about,|it turned out to be gas. Aha! Liar. Tomorrow, my office, 9.30. I'm tired of Mr Weed treating me|like a common doormat. I want him to treat me like a deluxe one|from Pottery Barn with the fancy straw. I don't care for Pottery Barn.

If you don't buy that,|sorry I was at the ball game. Peter, I just received terrible news. This company has been taken over|by a conglomerate.

What do you call it?|- A promotion. Oh, thanks. Here's a memo. Sometimes the business world's funny. And so on behalf of|the El Dorado Cigarette Company, I'd like to welcome you to our family. I think you'll be very happy|with the changes we've made. This is sweet! Why are you|putting a window in the factory? So Aunt Bee has a place|to let her pies cool. Hello, boys. Today's pie is cherry.|It'll be ready just in time for lunch. Wow. These guys sure know|how to run a company. Look how happy those morons are. They'll never realise we're using toys|to get children addicted to our company's cigarettes. (thunderclap) (whistles) Good boy, Connor. - (cocks gun) Pull.|- (dog squeals) (thunderclap) Can't we eat? I'm so hungry,|I could ride a horse. I don't get it.|I could ride it to the store, I guess. I told you we're not starting without your|father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him. Perhaps I could help simulate the|experience. Yum, yum, yum (grunting) Hey, family, anyone in the mood for lobster?|Ow! Oh, God! One of them has my pupil! Agh, agh, agh! Oh, God! Agh! Agh! Ah. How can you afford lobster on your salary? - I got a raise.|- What?! The new owners gave everyone raises. Even Kenneth, the badass mail clerk|with the heart of gold. - Hi, Kenneth. Did I get any mail?|- No! If you come any closer, I'll slice ya! OK, OK. Man, what a badass. Yeah? That ""badass"" just gave|half his pay cheque to orphans. Orphans with diseases.

Oh, my God!|They're trying to corrupt our children! Those bastards turned a whole generation|of Americans into smokers with subliminal advertising. - Timmy, where's Lassie?|- She's out in the orchard, Ma. Peaches are coming|in mighty early this year. Smoke. You know what they say:|""Early peaches, long summer"". Smoke. - (barks)|- What's that, Lassie? Are ya smoking yet? If kids see this doll,|they're gonna think smoking's OK. You have to talk to these|new bosses in the morning. Don't worry, Lois. I'll set 'em straight.|Just like I did with Chris. - Dad, what's the blowhole for?|- I'll tell you what it's not for, son. And when I do, you'll understand|why I can never go back to SeaWorld. We need to talk. My wife says|you're trying to get kids to smoke. - That's just not true.|- What about this toy? It's just a doll with a cigarette. Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see|eight-year-old kids driving. They're fun toys. - Smoke.|- Not now, Jerry. Trust me. The last thing we want|is to get kids to start smoking. What about that graph on the wall that says ""The first thing we want|is to get kids to start smoking."" That's just something|my son made me in art class. Huh. Then what about that poster that says ""The graph was not made in art class.|We really do want kids to start smoking."" We're a caring company. I mean, would you really be the president|of a company that didn't care about kids? - No. But I'm not the president.|- Yes, you are if you want to be. (all) Ah. Oh, wow. Imagine me, president. I'll do it! (hums ""Hail to the Chief"") - How did it go?|- I'm not finished yet. (hums) - Aren't you gonna ask me how it went?|- Did you talk to the executives? - (hums)|- Peter, answer me! - I did. They made me president.|- Of the whole company? All right, Dad! You shoulda seen the way they treated me.|I've never gotten that respect before. - Great work-out, Bobby.|- Up yours, sack-breath! That's Mr Griffin. Peter, why would they make you president? Maybe it's because I can recite all|50 states in a quarter of a second. (yelps) - That was just a loud yelping noise.|- Jeez, Lois. I thought you'd be proud of me. The company finally thinks|I'm worth something. Wait till you see all the perks we get. Um hi. Can I help you? Some company hired me to stand next|to you all day, so you'd look better. - That's ridiculous.|- Meg? Did you get less ugly? Yeah! - Surprise!|- Everything looks the same. It looks the same. But El Dorado Cigarettes coated the inside|of the house with a microfilm of Teflon, so it's easy to clean. Oh. Maybe I shouldn't have had 'em do the floors. I'm Nudes on Ice! This is so exciting.|Your father's first day as president. Good morning, First Family. - Lois, what's in this coffee?|- Isn't it wonderful? They sent Martha Stewart|to help me with the housework. I take back all the bad things I said|about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha. A little chicory perks up the taste|of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing. I think it's a crappy thing!|In fact, this is my last cigarette ever. You make me sick being bought off|with a few lousy perks. Oh, I beg to differ. Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr Griffin.|You have an executive parking space now. That looks exactly like my old space. This one comes|with your own company suck-up. - Morning. Nice day.|- It's a little cloudy. Absolutely. One of the worst days|I've seen in years. - Good news about the Yankees.|- I hate them. Pack of cheaters, they are. I love your tie. - I hate this tie.|- It's awful, it's gaudy, it's gotta go. - And I hate myself.|- You make me sick, you fat sack of crap. - I'm the president|- The best there is. - But you just said you hated me.|- But not you the president. The you who said you hated you.|You, who love, hate, Yankees, clouds I'll have that fixed for you, sir. Here's your new digs. Now get|to work, sport. We're counting on you. Wow. My own office.|I guess I'd better get busy. (sighs) Agh! (unzips flies) - (pencil sharpener)|- (scream) Gentlemen, we have a problem. There's an anti-smoking bill|that could put us out of business. Yes. Apparently, causing cancer|is this year's ""hot button"". We've tried everything|to get through to these politicians. Harvard lawyers, lobbyists,|wisecracking leprechauns. Excuse me. Do you have a dollar?|I'm a little short. That's the problem.|They're idiots in Washington. Instead of a smart guy, we should|send a moron they can relate to. (murmurs of agreement) Where are we going to find someone|who's that stupid? - Yeah. And not just stupid. Fat, too.|- (man) That's exactly what we need. Wait. Didn't we just make|a fat, stupid guy president? You bet we did. Gentlemen,|our new tobacco lobbyist is that guy! ("" ""That Guy"") So what's this big assignment|you got for me, chairman of the broad? (laughs) ""Chairman of the broad"".|When did you become such a stitch? Don't you remember? You gave me writers. ""I don't want to say you're rich,|but when you walk into a bank, all the tellers go 'Whoopee!""' That wasn't funny.|I thought you were Jewish. - He's only half-Jewish.|- You're fired. Here's the thing. Some troublemakers|in Congress are trying to shut us down. We need someone important like you|to go down to Washington and help those bastards see|what fun-loving people the tobacco industry's made of. Washington? Sweet. But I gotta warn you,|I've made some enemies on the Hill. And that's when Clarence Thomas|forced me into his chambers and showed me lewd pictures. We have indisputable evidence|that not only have you never been in the same room as Clarence Thomas,|you've never been in the same state. How do you respond to that? Bababooie! Bababooie!|Howard Stern's penis! Bababooie! How long is Dad gonna be in Washington? As long as it takes.|He's a very important man now. He's the spokesman for his entire industry. Thank you, Martha.|Brian, could you pass me the TV guide? - Piss off!|- What? I'm sorry. It just feels like for ever|since I've had a smoke. I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail! Mr Harrison? I see those government guys|you were telling me about. I'll show 'em a good time|and get 'em to come around to our side. Excuse me. Al Gore? George W Bush? - Yes?|- Yes? Great. And what's your friend's name? Dick Armey. - Oh, God. No, seriously. What's his name?|- Dick Armey. (chuckling) Oh. Oh, I just got it. Hey. Hey, Armey. Hey, what's your|wife's name? Vagina Coastguard? I'm kidding. Get in the car.|We're going to a skin bar. - OK.|- Great. That sounds good. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.|Oh, my God. I don't know what happened. Oh, it's OK.

They turned The Drunken Clam|into a British pub? Well, at least they still got sports on TV. The new bowler has a cover point, long-on,|square leg, extra cover and two short legs. What the hell is he talkin' about? It's cricket. Marvellous game, really. You see, the bowler hurls the ball towards the|batsman, who tries to play away to fine leg. He scores by dashing between the creases, provided the wicketkeeper|hasn't whipped his bails off. - Anybody get that?|- The only British idiom I know is that ""fag"" means ""cigarette"". - Well, someone tell this cigarette to shut up.|- Guys, there's no girlie magazines in the can!

I'm afraid I'm the limey bastard|who's purchased your bar. - Bit of an awkward moment, really.|- Awkward moment? I'll give you an awkward moment.|One time during sex, I called Lois ""Frank"". - Your move, Sherlock.|- Peter! Excuse us. Why are you acting like this?|Nigel's charming. All British men are. That's what they said|about Benjamin Disraeli. You don't even know who I am. The British are a lovely people.|Not physically, of course, but inside. And Nigel has a very sweet little daughter. (Cockney accent) Aw! Look at the little baby! - What the devil is that ghastly noise?|- It's me. Eliza Pinchley. You wanna flower, little baby? Excuse me, what I think|you mean to say is, would I like a flower? You don't so much speak the language|as chew it and spit it out. Go on. What's wrong with the way I talk? Everything. Here's a shiny sixpence|if you keep your mouth shut and go away. Oh I know The Drunken Clam was your bar, but you and your friends can find|somewhere else to act like idiots. I guess you're right.|You know why I married you, Lois? It's not just the rack or the caboose.|It's that big sexy brain of yours. (Lois giggles) - All right. This place isn't bad.|- Yeah. Good music, real sports on the tube. I've never seen so many chicks in one place. Hey, check out those two hotties. They're so|lonely, they're practisin' kissin' each other.

What's become of us?|We never squabbled before we lost The Clam. - Right. It's those lousy fog-breathers.|- Damn British. They took our bar, then our friendship. What's|next? Apple pie, fast cars and action films? (Schwarzenegger) It vas a glorious summer|in Oxford ven I met Freddy Cavendish. A most remarkable young man whose|friendship vould change my life forever. You are the anchor|that gives my spirit licence to soar. Our forefathers wouldn't|take it on the chin like this. Right. I say we fight the British and drive 'em|back to whatever country they came from. - Yeah! Yeah!|- We gonna get 'em. Stewie, look. It's an invitation|to little Eliza's birthday party. You mean that horrid girl|who talks like a scullery maid? I didn't realise she'd been born. I assumed|she'd congealed in a gutter somewhere. Ooh, I'm gonna RSVP right now. Splendid. An entire afternoon of her ""er""s|and ""ah""s and ""'alf a pound of ha'penny rice"". Why can't the English|teach their children how to speak? You teach her. If you're up to it. Oh, yes. This is the part where I'm|supposed to say ""I am so up to it. Ha ha ha."" Well, I am. I accept your challenge. At her party I shall pass that guttersnipe off|as a lady. What are the stakes of this wager? - Why don't you shut up for about a week?|- And if I win? I wasn't betting. Why don't you|just shut up for about a week? You're on! Minutemen, present arms. - Load weapons.|- Boom chaka-laka-laka boom chaka-laka. Fire! - Oh, I say!|- Throw the blackguards out. - I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.|- Don't tread on me. Yeah, back off. We kicked your ass|in World War II and we can do it again. Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably, we'll have to use our superior|linguistic skills to convince you to leave. Just try it. - Bye.|- Sorry to bother you. I never saw it that way before|Wait a minute. How the hell did they do that? We're not gonna let this stop us.|I've never been defeated. Except once. - Eric?|- Peter? Oh, my God. I haven't seen you since|high school. What are you doin' these days? - I'm the red guy.|- Oh, my God. - What about you?|- I'm the green guy. - No kiddin'?|- Yeah. - Hey, is that Stacy Beacham?|- Where? Now, don't worry, these guys are trained|to stay perfectly still. Check it out. Hey, Margaret Tha What the hell?|I thought you English guys never move. No, that's just our women. Bloody hell! My lunch was in that hat!|Egg and chips with jam butties. - Welcome to the Quahog beer party.|- I do feel a little guilty about pollutin'. - I felt Guilty once, but she woke up.|- Peter, what are you doin'? It may taste like a warm cup of|tobacco-chewer's spit, but it's still beer. Good point. Bottoms up! (Peter) Ha! Take that, you lousy Brits! Peter! We waited up all night.|Where were you? Wh-where was I? Where were you? - Out drinkin'. But I was back by two.|- Oh, no. Our top story: The Clam's Head Pub|has burned to the ground. Our own Tricia Takanawa is on the scene. Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist?|Police say no, but our producer says yes. Here's an artist's depiction|of what the arsonist might look like. Anyone with information regarding this|suspect should contact police immediately. One thing is certain: The pain here is palpable. For many, this charred portrait of Elizabeth II gives poignant new meaning to the phrase|""Hey, check out that flaming queen."" In a late development|the police have a new suspect. We now go live to Hispanic|reporter Maria J Ji Jim - Jimenez.|- I know what it is. At this moment we're|approaching the suspect's house. This is better than COPS. You know|there's a fat drunk guy in there. - Hold it!|- Freeze! - There he is.|- Griffin, you're comin' with us. I wanna see what they do with this jackass. - Hands up!|- Oh, Peter, you didn't! - Hey, fatty's wife is a babe.|- That's it. It appears the real arsonist is in custody,|thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities. Good. Good. Ah, the fat guy's struggling. Hit him,|you stupid pigs! Hit him. Use the billy This Minutemen flag was found|in the wreckage of The Clam's Head. You are clearly guilty of arson,|so you are free to go. Straight to jail. Ha!|Now you got burned! No bail. - Peter, tell me you didn't do this.|- Lois, I didn't do it. You can trust me, right?|Let's sit down and talk about this. - I wanna believe you but agh!|- (laughs) Gotcha! But seriously, you can trust me. Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry|this terrible tragedy has befallen you. Thank you, Nigel. You're very kind. - Can I touch your bum once?|- What? I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday bash.|I won't take no for an answer. Unless the question is ""Do you not like me?"" Get it? Double negative, you know.|Yes, very good. Hey hey hey, check out the new meat. - I like the fat one. More cushion for pushin'.|- Thank you. - Hey, we gonna have a good time together.|- Gosh, everybody's so nice here. I mean, they're gonna be disappointed|when they find out I'm not gay, but wow. Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most|vicious killer I ever put away, Steve Bellows. - He's so mean, he shot a man for snoring.|- Where have I heard that before? It's in this simulated-leather edition|of Time-Life's Killers of Quahog. They're all here. John the Biter, the Berserk|Hobo, the Golden Autumn Day Strangler Maybe Steve won't remember you. Well, well. Officer Swanson. You and|your friends are dead. You're all dead! (sighs) Oh, good. He thinks we're zombies. He'll leave us alone. No, no, no! If you're ever going to|be a lady, you must speak like one. Now try it again. ""The life|of the wife is ended by the knife."" The loif of the woif No, no, no. Not ""loif"". Life! Life! - That's what I said. Loif.|- Listen, you tin-eared piece of baggage. We've got five days left, and I'll not|lose my wager. Now repeat after me. (emphasises H's) ""Hello, Mother,|have you hidden my hatchet?"" 'Ello, Mother, 'ave you 'idden my 'atchet? Oh, God, no. It's an H sound,|you moron. H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! - Ew. Your breath smells like kitty litter.|- I was curious! - Our husbands couldn't have done this.|- Cleveland can't even light the damn hibachi. Excuse me. Where can I find Nigel Pinchley? I'm from Quahog Insurance.|I have a cheque for him. - Five million dollars?!|- He took out a policy just before the fire. Doesn't that strike you as a little suspicious? No, not really. In fact,|it seems to happen all the time. - Oh, no. Here comes Steve!|- I haven't forgot about you boys. Saturday night at midnight.|You're dead. All of you are dead. Midnight on Saturday? Thank God!|We can still be in the talent show. From the top, boys. A-five, six, seven, eight. ("" show tune) Once again, here is how it should sound.|""How do you do?"" Here's how you sound. - (mooing)|- Now try it again. - (perfect English accent) How do you do?|- What did you say? ""The life of the wife is ended by the knife."" I think she's got it. I think she's got it! ""The life of the wife is ended by the knife By George, she's got it!|By George, she's got it! Now, what ends her wretched life? ""The knife, the knife And where's that bloody knife? ""In the wife, in the wife (both) "" The life of the wife|is ended by the knife Bravo, Eliza! ""The life of the wife is ended by the knife Hello. So nice to see you. There he is. We need to search the house for|evidence, but one of us has to distract Nigel. Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't. What about Loretta? Nigel looks|like he's down with the swirl. There you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand|tour and show you my private quarters? - I'd love to.|- I must say, you look absolutely mmm mmm mm-mm-mm. Don't be shy, lambie lamb. This is my study, where I study|things that arouse my interest. (Lois thinks) Oh, good. The girls are in place. Oh, Nigel. Since Peter's been gone,|I've been searching for someone new. You know? Someone with|a sense of danger and adventure. - I once played cricket without shin guards.|- Oh, I love a reckless man. One time I went up to this bloke's flat,|rang the bell and ran like Sebastian Coe. Lois growls like a tiger)|More! Tell me more! I burned down my pub for the insurance|money and framed your husband. I knew it! And what's more,|I have witnesses. Bonnie. Loretta? Demond Wilson from Sanford|and Son? What are you doing here? I know. I'm surprised I'm alive too. Sorry, love. Better luck next time. Mr Pinchley, I heard everything. And what you've done is a textbook|example of insurance fra-ud? Bloody hell. - Why the devil were you in the closet?|- I came with Demond. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Eliza Pinchley. Psst. You. Dogbert. Down here.|Get a front-row seat for this one. (perfect English accent)|How kind of you all to come. Magnificent! Old sport, why don't you pull your face from|your loins and bury it into some humble pie? (Cockney accent) Bloody 'ell!|I've gone and wet meself. Don't give me that smug look. Fine!|You have extra-sensitive hearing: Hear this. (mouths) - I'm telling.|- I No! I said ""vacuum""! - Hurry, Peter. Steve'll be here in five minutes.|- Oh, crap. We're dead. This is the end, boys. Looks like our next stop|is a corner booth in a bar in heaven. Peter, Nigel confessed. You're free! - You hear that, guys? We're free!|- (all cheer) Get ready to die! Oh. I wonder what this feels like. Ow! That hurts! My God, is that what I've been|doin' to people? I belong here. Horace, I never thought|I'd see you or The Clam again. Florida stunk. Alligator mounted me when I wasn't lookin'.|Laid eggs in my lower intestine. But you're all thirsty.|I'll bore you another time. Here's to our wives. They may not be|as hot as the women you see on TV. Or as entertaining. But, um I don't know where I'm goin'|with this. But thanks. I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson.|Whatever he gets is too good for him. Dear Stewie, I want you to know|that I blame my father's death and my incarceration in this hellhole|entirely on your awful mother. If it takes the rest of my life, I shall see that|she suffers a slow and painful death. Eliza. (laughs) Excellent. Here, have a look. Good. Good."

In fact, a lot of women prefer them|to normal-size bananas, because they're exotic and flavourful|and very, very special. Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring|for the plantain section. Stop with this! You're overreacting to this Chris stuff. I mean, mine goes inside me|when I stand up. How do you think I feel? - Is Dad mad at me?|- Oh, of course not, honey. Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me|at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items! (gasp) Nice, huh? Huh? Yeah. You like this? Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me.|Look, I know you're upset, but - Oh, my God. Where's Stewie?|- He's around. Let me out of this|stink-filled corduroy dungeon! - Peter, that's sick!|- It's OK. He's outside the underwear. - Enjoy your new car, Mr Griffin.|- Thanks, Jim. When you pull that thing into your garage,|does the garage say ""Is it in yet?"" Don't worry, baby. I'll be gentle. Ow. My pride. You were right. I was nice to the cool kids|and they didn't spit on me. Connie Demico even|invited me to her sweet 16. Wonderful! What time do we nail|those snot-nosed punks?! Nail them? You told me|to win them over with kindness. Yes. Now that they think you're their friend,|it's the perfect time to exact your revenge. Revenge? I'm like one of those bald eagles|you see on the Discovery Channel: Beautiful to look at,|but mess with one of my chicks and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip|your (beep) eyes out! Cookies are done. - Who wants chocolate-chip?|- I do! But keep talking. All this stuff about|eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky. Really. I've got about half a pack|of Rolaids in my diaper. I'm glad you want to join|the National Gun Association. Let me show you around.|This is our shooting range. Here we have our locker room|with full shower facilities. Holy crap! They're all so small! You see, Peter, the way we look at it,|a man's only as big as the gun he carries. Sign me up, and get me|the biggest freakin' gun you got! - Stewie, you can come out now.|- Turn off the light. I'm reading a ghost story. Pull! Oh, yeah.|Who's the big man now, huh? - Madonna or Janet Jackson?|- Which Janet? - Velvet Rope.|- Yeah, that one. Pull! - What the hell are you doing with that?|- You want to touch it? Go on. Careful. We don't want it to get|too excited and go off in your hand. This is pathetic. All because|you feel inadequate next to Chris. Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete|with my son or his freakishly large penis. - I'm a freak.|- Don't despair. Let's hang a tyre on the end of it|and head on down to the ol' swimming hole. Connie Demico's house is two storeys.|If we set up booby traps here, here - How'd you get these blueprints?|- Oh, your mother has her ways. She has her ways. - Can I have those blueprints?|- Sure, here you go. Now I've put together|a little flash bomb to create a diversion. I used to date|the pyro guy from Whitesnake. What's Whitesnake? That's the music mommies and daddies|listen to. Fire in the hole! Some guys from the club|are going hunting tomorrow. - Count me in.|- Hunting? - You were gonna play hockey with Chris.|- Bring him along. - Oh, no. It's too dangerous.|- Lois, Lois. The National Gun Association is all about|safety, especially when it comes to kids. Take a look at our new video. Let's face it, your kids will get|into your guns. That's a fact. Gun accidents can be avoided by|introducing your children to guns early. Hi! I'm Petey the pistol.|Say, do you ever get Ionely? - Yes.|- Me, too. Hold me. If you squeeze me,|I make bad people go away. But wait a minute.|I thought guns were bad. (narrator) False! Guns are good. In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses|used guns to conquer the Romans? So remember: Guns don't kill people,|dangerous minorities do. See, Lois? They're responsible. Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris.|I can write my name in the snow. - This is fun, Dad.|- Son, son, I told you. Out here in the wilderness,|call me Rooster Cogburn. I was starting to think|you didn't like me any more. Shh. Chris, look! Tracks.|There must be a deer around here. - Those are snowmobile tracks.|- Shh! There he is. Such grace. That's the thing|about hunting - you gotta be patient. (growl) What the hell was that?! (both yelling) Put this in the heating grate|and set it off in five minutes. I changed my mind. I won't do it. - They're my friends now.|- They pelted you with meat. Did you forget the neighbour kids|chased you and sprinkled you with fixings? Yes, I did! OK. Now we're gonna play|Seven Minutes in Heaven, and it's my party, so I want Doug|to go in the closet with Meg. Have fun. OK. Everyone get ready.|Say hello to the lovers. (laughter) I don't know who should be|more humiliated, Meg or the pig. - She's such a dork.|- I think I feel worse for the pig. Mom, you were right!|I should have just stuck to the plan! I figured you might get soft on me,|so I hired an old friend to scar them for life. (doorbell) - Hey there, sweetie. How old are you?|- 16. - 18?! You're first.|- Mom! I like where this is going.|Giggidy-giggidy-good-goody. Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear.|Say hello to Satan for me! It's a boy, Mrs Griffin. I'm afraid the fever|has affected his motor skills. He's gonna have to repeat the fourth grade. Looks like he'll have to repeat|the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin. The only way to get rid of them|is with this shampoo and a tiny comb. Congratulations.|You've passed the fourth grade. Great. I gotta leave though.|I'm going hunting with my son. Dad, I know what to do!|I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack! Go away! Go on, get!|Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal! Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing.|I mean, I just froze up. But you handled that bear like a real man.|I'm proud of you, son. You are? Because I heard|what you said about my huge you know. Oh. Oh, you heard that, huh? I was just being stupid. Take it from me,|that thing you got there is a blessing. I mean, every guy you see with a big house|or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth is really just saying|""Don't look at my penis."" - But you'll never have to worry about that.|- Thanks, Dad! You're the best. You know, Dad, I just realised something.|Your name's Peter. You're right, it is. Peter. (both laughing)"

You think you could do that? All we gotta do is get you fixed up.|Get your hair cut, give you a good, clean (screams) shave, cologne Chicks'll be all over you. - Gee!

Get the note for Mommy. How dare you use me|for your own personal selfish Hmm. Oh. Pull slower. I must remember|to do this game when no one's around. What was I thinking?

Forget that. I'm taking you out for shore leave. - Does this look like a ""Q"" to you?|- No. - How about now?|- Your crotch just looks like Lois to me. Let's ask her then. Lois, should Peter|sit around and mope all night? Or should Peter go out with his buddy|and have some fun? All right! That one's a feminist type,|she's into he-men, and that one's mad for jazz. Watch this. The plight of women is deplorable.|I can bench-press 800 pounds. You, me and Coltrane till dawn. There you go, Peter.|One for you, two for me. You guys go on without me. (sighs) - So why didn't you go with them?|- You don't know what it's like in love. Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy.|She works at a pet store. I met her last summer when her dad|hung himself. I was too shy to ask her out. - What's with that moustache?|- Let me see that. Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos.|Here, this is her. - Nice ass.|- Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos's ass. I guess I don't have a photo.|Trust me, she's cute. Let's go get her. - I'll need that picture of Olmos's ass back.|- Oh, yeah. Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell! I found the note!|""Go back to the mini-mart""? This isn't very creative. Let's go, kids. Mom, you remember that goldfish|we flushed down the toilet? - He wasn't dead.|- (cocks gun) - There she is. That's her.|- All right, go on. Just like we practised. - Hey, you.|- Hi. I was just, uh uh in in I was just|in the neighbourhood and So I thought that, uh So You I'll, uh This is a bad time.

Hey, does this look like a ""Q"" to you? - (woman screams)|- How about now? So, where is it that you need to go,|my new honky friend? Rhode Island. That's not too far, is it? Nothing's too far away from Maxine,|the cheatin' queen. Women. That's not fair. I'm just speaking out of hurt. That truck's coming up on us awful fast. Holy crap! Do you see what I see? - I'm afraid I do.|- We're being chased by ghosts! You went through all this to see your girl? I sure did, and I'm a fat idiot.|What's your excuse, you big chicken? - Chicken?

Mom, you could be a world champion, and no one could hit you below the belt|cos girls don't have anything down there. - Can you teach me to kick ass?|- No. I do not condone violence. I won't be responsible for|bringing fistfighting into our schools. Gee, can you hear me|all the way back there in the '50s? - That was lame.|- Poor Peter. I emasculated him in front of all those people.|I think he's really upset. Gather round, everybody.|10 bucks is all it takes. Step right up and fight my wife. Come one, come all. She floats like a|butterfly and stings like when I pee. Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction.|At least, not any more. Me likey bouncy! Me likey bouncy! I want you to get rid of all of this right now,|cos I am never fighting again, ever! Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to plan B. No! Oh, God! Oh, my God! Help me! Help me!|For God's sake, he's gonna kill me! Don't worry. It's a trained bear.|He's in no real danger. He's teaching a class. I can't bother him now. Sure you can. Hey, Ralph Macchio!|My wife here needs to talk to you. There you go, honey. - What is it, Lois?|- I don't think I should do tae-jitsu any more. - I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt someone.|- But, Lois, you're my star pupil. - I want you in my advanced class.|- Advanced class? No, no, no. - I'm trying to quit.|- Well, fine. Quit. - But get used to people walking all over you.|- Hold on, there. Nobody walks all over my wife,|cos I won't let 'em. - Peter|- Quiet. Men are talking. She learns things eventually.|It just takes her longer. Come on. If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats.|I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on. I'll do it. Ow! - Stewie, you wanna swing?|- Yes, why not? I'll have a go at it. Perhaps a quick stretch first. Damn. Must have pulled something|playing hoops last week. I know you're not puttin' that rock|up from here. You ain't got no J. - Yo, man, that's trippin'!|- You're the one who's trippin'. Cry home to your mama. She waitin' for ya. Now don't make me put|my size 13s up your narrow ass! I don't sweat you. Bring it on, bitch!|Now how you gonna act? Sheesh! Bringin' that trash in here.|This is my house. Excuse me. We were about to use that. - You snooze, you lose, lady.|- You have two choices. Either my baby swings from|this jungle gym, or you do. Ooh, Lois! Someone's wearing|their ovaries on the outside. - She saw me walking to the swing.|- She saw you. Easy, now. Nobody walks all over me. Those days|are over. Lois Griffin demands respect. I smell a messy diaper.|God, why does that turn me on? - Hold it, Meg. Those two are mine.|- What? That's Randy, and that's Fred.|Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat. When you get 'em together,|hold on to your sides! Nice to meet you both. Murderer! Stop it, both of you. Starting now,|you two are gonna love each other. Now stay that way. It's gonna be weird to potty. Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage|those damn leafers dumped on our lawn. New York Post, New York Magazine,|the New York Mets. Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine|about the leafers. Take some action. Free the beast! That was strangely arousing. Aagh! Hello? 911? It's Quagmire.|Yeah. It's in a window this time. - Wow, look at them run.|- Wait a second, Brian. That gives me an idea. The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go|someplace fancy, like The Olive Garden? The breadsticks!|Me likey breadsticks! Me likey - You're a big girl now. Stop it.|- Hold on, Lois. Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat,|and I had sex with your mother last night. - Are you crazy?|- What did you say? About the seat, or about|my ploughing your father's wife? - What the hell are you doing?|- Excuse me. Is your refrigerator running? If it is, it probably runs like you -|very homosexually. - What?!|- Oh, you wanna dance? Jets suck, Yankees suck, Knicks suck. Krypton sucks. (echoing cries) That's right. Go back where|you came from, you bastards! We'll conclude the graduation ceremony|with a demonstration by the black belts. Let's show 'em what we've learnt. - Kathy, get in there with Lois.|- I can't. I have cramps. Why are you putting me up|against the scrubs? - Be a man and fight me yourself.|- Lois, the sensei is a sacred position. I could never violate the spiritual bond|of the student-master relationship. - Then allow me.|- (spectators) Ooh! - The bond is broken.|- Then spin the wheel, raggedy man! Go, Lois! Pummel him|with your powerful fists of female fury. And then when he's weary,|emasculate him with your incessant nagging. Women! Yakety-yak, yakety-yak, yak, yak. You know, huh? Enjoy the fight. Yah! Lois, that was amazing. Congratu This is mine.|This is where my babies come from. And now back to the movie of the week. If this glacier goes slower|than one mile a year, we're all dead! Tell me something I don't know!|Get out of the way! Lois, I was watching that. - What you looking at?|- The underpants. Lose 'em. Actually, I kinda|I sorta have a headache, kinda. - Maybe tomorrow or|- Take 'em off. Yeah, OK, honey. Whoa! What the hell are you doing?|Those are my graham crackers. Run along, Stewie. Daddy had a rough night. Why, you tottering, fem-sucked dewberry! I'm going to go find something|to strike you with. Excuse me. Good morning.|Peter, you look terrible. What happened? Last night Lois was the man! - Good Lord.|- I just want you to know, Brian, I didn't cry. - (sobs)|- It's OK. Shh. Oh, no! Peter! Stewie, what did you do? He freed the beast|all over the back of Peter's head. Oh, my God. This is my fault. This is my fault!|I brought violence into this house! - I'm the worst mother in the world!|- Ah-ha! I got it all on tape. (Stewie) OK, this is me|interviewing Ed Sullivan. What's new, Ed? (imitates Ed) Well, Stewie,|tonight we have a really big show. (Stewie) OK, and now a word|from our sponsors. It takes a very steady hand.|Don't touch the sides! Butterfingers! I was making radio shows for fun. Everybody does it.|At least, everybody I know. Shut up! Stewart, take this mommy doll and daddy|doll and show me how they act together. Oh. Yes, very well. All right. ""Margaret, after 20 years of marriage, your|curious indiscretions no longer faze me."" ""Really? And I suppose|you think I enjoy hanging onto those hammocky deposits of|gin sugars you call buttocks?"" - What was that? What did you just write?|- Give me that. ""Insecurity. Gender confusion.""|I'll give you something to write about. Look at me. I'm insane!|I'm Martin Lawrence on a bender. Mr and Mrs Griffin, does Stewart|have a history of aggression? No. Hitting Peter is the first|violent thing he's ever done. Technically, the first was that time bomb|I left ticking in your uterus before I came out. Happy 50th birthday, Lois. Your son is learning|misbehaviour from someone. I I know who's responsible|for Stewie's behaviour, but if I told you,|Lois'd beat the crap out of me. Now, just a minute! The whole reason|I started fighting is because of you. I felt weak. You never listen to me.|You undermine me in front of the kids. And besides, you're not exactly|Father of the Year yourself. Well, there seems to be a lot|of anger in your household. You owe it to your son to learn|how to manage these feelings. Manage what? I know I went a little overboard|with my tae-jitsu, but from now on we're not gonna have|any more anger in this house, OK? Tell Chris to quit drawing|pictures of me with a pig's body. - Don't censure me!|- No more anger! OK. The psychologist wants us|to try an exercise called role reversal, where we pretend to be|the person who makes us angry. I'll go first. ""Don't listen to your mother, kids.|She's worthless and dumb."" ""Lgnore her and only listen to me - Peter."" ""I'm Lois. I brake for yard sales,|but I don't let Peter buy anything he likes, like that Narragansett beer sign|where the hot chick has two mugs for jugs."" It was eight freakin' dollars,|and we have a dozen places to put it! Me next, me next! ""I'm the dog. I'm well-read|and have a diverse stock portfolio, but I'm not above eating grass clippings and|regurgitating them on the rug by the door."" ""I'm a pompous antichrist who will probably|drop my plans for world domination when I grow up and fall in love|with a rough trick named Jim."" Whoa, Peter, calm down. I'm sick of Lois's anger-management|techniques. They're not working. What about writing angry letters|and not sending them? - I wasn't supposed to send those?|- (Meg) I got a letter from Dad. ""Dear Meg. For the first four years of your|life, I thought you were a house cat."" Dad! ""Dear Stewie. Get out."" That's nice. Mine just says ""Dear Lois."" And after that|it looks like someone just spit on the paper. - You got somethin' to say to me?|- Yeah. PS: (gathers phlegm in throat) Hold on a sec. Hold on. Relax. Everybody, relax. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this, but we need to get our anger under control|before we kill each other. My psychiatrist gave me|these mood elevators. I think they could help even us out. We're not taking pills. It's not natural. Nor is bleaching the hair|on your upper lip, Martin Mull. Give us the pills. - "" Ah-um|- "" Ba-ba - "" Ah-um|- "" Ba-ba ""Ay-oh, Mother Africa ""Ah-um ""Ba-ba That was fun. What country shall we do next? Monaco. Wait - that's a principality. Wanna hear something really funny? Those|pills I gave you were placebos. Sugar pills. (chuckles) Are you telling me I just sang|Ladysmith Black Mambazo for nothing? Did it kill you to be|multicultural for a minute? - I died a little inside, yes. You happy now?|- Don't you use that tone of voice, you - What were you gonna say? Fat ass?|- Wide load? - Dough boy?|- Country virtuoso Roy Clark? - How about all of the above?|- How's this for a name? ""Pony Express is in.""|""What have you got for me, Joe?"" ""Let me see. It's here somewhere."" ""Here we are. A big bag|of liver spots for Lois."" - You You just hit me.|- That's right. - You can't hit me! I'm a girl!|- Sometimes I wonder. - Kicking, Lois?|- Ha! Hurts, doesn't it? You tell me. Go, Dad! Kick her ass! - Shut up! This is all Dad's fault.|- I don't like to be touched! Aaagh! Aaaaagh! (chuckles) Man, I'm glad we got that out of our systems. - I wonder what came over us.|- Maybe people are naturally violent. I don't believe that.|I think it's all the TV we watch. - There's so much violence.|- Yeah, TV is dangerous. Why the hell doesn't the government|tell us what we can and can't watch? Shame on the network|that puts this junk on the air! Peter, maybe you shouldn't say|anything bad about the network. What are they gonna do? Cut our budget?|I'm gonna go get a beer."

I mean, I could hook this car battery up to my nipples. Oh, God! Ow! Ow! Ow! This doing it for you? I don't know. I just don't feeI that spark anymore. I mean, our honeymoon. So much rug burn! Wait a second, lois. That's what we need. We'll go on a second honeymoon. Peter, that's a wonderfuI idea! Yeah. We'll be just like The Honeymooners!

I'll take good care of them, lois. You guys have a good time. - Be good. - Bye, Mom, I love you! Brian, if I choose to make stooI in my pants right now you're the only one here to change me. What do you think of that? - I'm not gonna change you. - What? - I said, I'm not going to change you. - You can't be serious. What if I make a fudgie? I just won't, that's all. I just won't.

Of course, I'll want a favor in exchange. How does it smell, dog? Does it smell like servitude? Aft torpedoes, fire! lois? Hey, lois, honey? Sweetheart? You're awake! - Hey, can you hand me the pretzels? - Here. Where are we? About two hours from Cape Cod's most luxurious bed and breakfast. Peter, this is gonna be wonderfuI.

I fall asleep for 10 minutes and you plow the car into a tree? Oh, my God! You got to pay attention to the road. We could have been killed! I mean, look at the front of our car. It's totaled. It's completely totaled, Peter! This is just terrific. How are we gonna get- Oh, my God! I knew I should have driven. I should always drive. I cannot trust you, Peter Griffin! Dear God, this is where we're sleeping? Come on, lois. They said they'd have the car fixed by tomorrow. And then our second honeymoon's back on track. Peter, there's a hooker on the bed. - Hi. - Stand perfectly still, lois. Their vision is based on movement. Where did you go? And now back to Two and a Half Men. Kill me! Turn it, Chris. I want to watch George lopez, That show only furthers the stereotype that George lopez is funny. - Give me that! - Chris, Give me the remote. - Chris, stop! - Stop doing that! My hat! Wear it now. You two better settle down. - Chris, give Meg her hat. - I don't have to listen to you. You're a dog! You don't have a souI! Ow. Don't take that. Raise your voice to them. Hey! Knock it off! look, you kids are obviously in need of some type of activity. I don't know. What do you say we read a book or something? Stewie, what does Peter have on his bookshelf? Two Garfield books and the novellzation of the movie Caddyshack, ""Mananananana,"" said Ty, sinking yet another ball. ""Mananananana-"" Hang on. Thank God. ""Garfield at large, by Jim Davis. "" Now, as you can see in this paneI, Garfield doesn't care for NermaI. But like him or not, NermaI is here to stay. Or is he? let's read on. Okay, I'll be there. Peter and lois were supposed to chaperone Chris' schooI dance tomorrow night. So, I guess it's up to me. You mean it's up to us. Clearly you need my help with this parenting thing. You're too stupid to do it alone. Besides, I know how to deaI with children, unlike Mr. Geppetto. Oh, no. I dropped my glasses. By the way, Pinocchio, there was a cookie missing from the jar. Did you take it by any chance? Yes, Papa Geppetto. I'm sorry. Are you sure you took it? Because I'd believe you if you said you didn't. No, I took it, Papa. I wouldn't lie to you. You could try. Who knows? You might get away with it. $900 to fix the car. That was all the money we had for this trip. look, Peter, this second honeymoon was a nice thought but maybe we should just go home. Coming up, handsome mustachioed man recaps news in pleasing baritone, Stay tuned for this and more, But first, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa is on hand for the opening of Manhattan's newest luxury hotel, Diane, I am standing outside the Park Barrington Hotel because they don't allow Asians inside, Fancy place. Boy, that'd make some second honeymoon. The Park Barrington is already attracting some big names, Such as Christianity enthusiast Mel Gibson, who has his own room on permanent reserve, A room which he barely uses, Barely uses? lois, I just got an idea! Much better than that time I experimented with gene splicing. lois, quick question. Do we have any TylenoI? How I envy them, dog. They've got their whole lives ahead of them. Man, look at that kid. That is one ugly eighth grader. You don't want to hurt yourself dancing. Make sure you stretch out those creamy hamstrings. Come on, Chris. It's just vodka. Jake swiped it from his dad's liquor cabinet. Yeah, see? It's good. Well, okay. Maybe just one sip. Christopher Griffin, is that alcohoI? Mister, you're in serious trouble. He's absolutely right, kids. Because when you drink, nobody wins. In fact, last year alone, there were over 27,000 deaths from chronic liver disease as a result of alcohoI abuse. - Now we know. - And knowing is half the battle. G.I. Joe! - Peter, we can't afford this. - No, but MeI Gibson can. Excuse me, I'm MeI Gibson, here for the key to my specially reserved room. You're MeI Gibson? Yes, I've put on a few pounds for my next role. I play Peter Griffin, a heroic warrior who defied the English to free England - from the English. - Holy mackereI! let me show you to your room, Mr. Gibson! Peter, the toilet paper is made of money. Yeah, and look at this. They even got some of that high-class British porn. Almost, Almost, Almost, - There we are, - Well done, Did you think you were cooI? Did you think you were grown up? I didn't actually drink any of it. Besides, Jake Tucker gave it to me. We are going to have a talk with Jake's parents tomorrow after my burping. And, in the meantime, you're grounded, Chris. Come on. That sucks! - Do you want us to pull over? - I don't care what you do! We'll pull over. We'll pull over. Pull over. If your teachers ask about your bruises, what do you tell them? I got hit by a baseball! - MeI! - MeI? Wait a minute. You were fantasizing about MeI Gibson. You don't find me attractive anymore. Honey, I'm sorry. I know you're trying. But you can't force the spark back into our marriage. Well, then I guess this whole second honeymoon was a waste of time. - Peter- - I don't want to talk about it! I'm just gonna watch British porn. You know, Margaret, we could have sexual intercourse right now, - Yes, yes we could, - But, let's not, Do you think we were too hard on Chris tonight? What? Oh, God, no. No, no. I don't I don't think so. Do you? No, I just always feeI badly when we have to be strict. Did I remember to turn the stove off? Yes. I'm sorry for everything that's happened, Peter. I guess I'm going through a phase right now where I'm only attracted to handsome men. Well, what are we supposed to do, lois? Just admit that there's no excitement left in our marriage? Go home and spend the rest of our lives looking at each other across the breakfast table, talking about how much we both like TotaI? - I love TotaI. - Actually, so do I. And it's healthy for us, too. Oh, God! It's starting already! lois, we are screwed. MeI Gibson's secret screening room. Hey, what's this? The Messiah, he's gone, Where did he go? Hang on, Man, you crazy, Jesus, You crazy! That's what my ex-wife said, For the son of God, you sure are a son of a- Chris Tucker and Jim, Caviziel? Is that it? The guy from the first one? Passion of the Christ 2: Crucify This. - You know how to use one of these? - You know how to use one of these? This July, let he who is without sin kick the first ass, Man, that's all we need. More MeI Gibson Jesus mumbo jumbo. Well, not if I have anything to say about it! I am going to make sure this never sees the light of day. Peter, are you crazy? Steallng MeI Gibson's towels, bathrobes, and Nazi paraphernalla is one thing, but this is a multi-million-dollar fllm. And he's a very powerfuI man. He could have us arrested or kllled. It's worth the risk, lois. To save the world another two hours of torture. We gotta get rid of this thing for the sake of Jesus and Snoopy and all the other beloved chlldren's characters. let's go! Pardon me. We work for MeI Gibson. Seems he left something very valuable in his room and we're here to retrieve it. Mr. Gibson just checked out a moment ago. There he goes now. lois, run! Hey, stop! They're gaining on us. We never should have stolen this film. Man, this is even more intense than that time I forgot how to sit down. Don't worry, lois. I think I know how to lose them. - Peter, what the hell are you doing? - lois, trust me. - How many times have I done this before? - All right, but be careful. Okay, now, be polite. And for God's sake don't mention anything about his kid's face. Shut up! I am always so polite. I hope we don't wind up on the evening news 'cause of this. You're funny. Brian, please come in. Can my wife, Stacy, get you anything? - Go to hell, Tom. - Already there, hon. Yes, well, Mr. Tucker, it seems your son Jake had some vodka at the schooI dance and Chris got blamed for it. This whole situation has just turned his whole life upside-down face. It's no concern of mine if it's turned his life upside-down face. - Jake's a good boy. Aren't you, Jake? - Yeah! - look, Mr. Tucker, I- - We're through here. Get out of my house, Benji! Fine! If you're gonna be that way about it, maybe I'll do this. - Yeah, look at this. - Stop that! Yeah, you don't like this, huh? - This is what Benji would do. - Stop doing that in my carpet! - Knock it off! Stop it! - That feels so good. There's got to be a way to get back at Jake Tucker for what he did to Chris. I know! let's plant drugs in his locker. - Oh, my God! That's a great idea. - Yeah, thought you'd like that. Hey, look at that Yosemite Sam mud flap. You had better stay back, Brian. I think we lost them. You stay here. I'm gonna go bury this fllm. Well, MeI Gibson, this is one piece of crap the world wllI never have to suffer through. I am so clever. That's why they picked me to convince Congress to go to war. There is no just cause for an invasion of Iraq. Well, that may be. But what we're all forgetting is anyone who doesn't want to go to war is gay. - I want to go to war. - Yes. - We should definitely go. - Yes, we should totally go to war. I was the first one who wanted to go to war. Peter! lois! Don't take this personally, Mrs. Griffin. I'm doing this because I have to. What are you gonna do to me? What are you gonna do to me? As soon as your husband gives me what I want, you're free to go. Anybody home? - Peter! - All right, Gibson. I want my wife back. Or a woman of equaI physicaI attractiveness. Where's the fllm? - Come on, honey, let's get out of here. - You're just gonna give him the fllm? Don't worry, lois. There's a dog turd in there. But by the time he finds out, we'll be long- There's a dog turd in here. - lois? - What? Jump! No, wait! I'll deaI with them myself. We're on top of the monument. Holy crap! You know, I know this is the wrong time to be star struck but MeI Gibson is shooting at us. Peter, help! Oh, man. I'm coming, lois. lois, look. I'm a booger. - Peter, for God's sake! - Okay. Grab my hand. And now, Mr. Griffin, I want that fllm. Sure. It's right over there in President Rushmore's mouth. My God! He just walked right over the edge. Of course, he did. Christians don't belleve in gravity. - Peter, it's back. - What, that rash? No, the spark. Honey, I have never been more attracted to you than I am right now. Really? Wow! So I guess this honeymoon was just the kind of excitement our marriage needed. - I guess it just goes to show that you- - Shut up and let's do it! Peter! Yes! Hey, Jefferson, check it out. A chick getting nalled on my head. Sweet. Hey, Teddy, pass the word down to Frankenstein. Oh, ha-ha! In local news, a Buddy Cianci Junior High School student has been arrested for possession of drugs, The student has been sentenced to 200 hours of community service and is a very bad boy, We now go to Ollie Williams for the punishment forecast, Ollie? - He gonna get it! - Thanks, Ollie, Now this, So you actually put coke in that kid's locker? - Yup. - Where'd you get it? I got a guy. Don't let it get the best of you. I used to be a Lawyer. See you next week. Good to be back, America."

                    			In the television comedy world, the people are entertained by two separate yet equally important types of shows. TraditionaI sitcoms that get laughs out of everyday situations like trying to fix your own plumbing or inviting two dates to the same dance. And animated shows that make jokes about farting. This is the latter. Sorry. I just farted. I'm glad you guys could come tonight. Chris, honey, we wouldn't miss your open house. You kids are the most important thing in our lives. Oh, my God! We forgot Meg. Don't worry about Meg. She's got everything she needs in her room. Most of the time, the kids'll exercise out in the field. But if it's raining or I'm hung-over, they stay inside and play dodge ball. I love dodge ball! Heads up! And this week in Home Ec, we're teaching your kids how to make bundt cake. I love bundt cake!

I'm free! - Is she coming back? - I don't know. I can't believe Ms. Clifton's gone. Who's gonna teach my class now? Brian, why don't you teach Chris's class? You're very knowledgeable, the kids might knock you down a few pegs which would be good for you. You know, that is a terrific idea, Lois. I probably have a lot to offer young people. What's he going to teach them? How to lick the Dorito crumbs from between the sofa cushions? Or how to leave a dead bird on the carpet? That was a gift, you bastard. That was a gift for the family. Good morning, class. I'm your substitute teacher, Brian Griffin. Good morning, Mr. Griffin. Please. Call me Brian. Mr. Griffin is my father. I thought your father's name was Cocoa, and he was hit by a milk truck! all right. Our goaI here is to gain a command of the English language. So you can be successfuI writers like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. There. Finished. Good Will Hunting by Matt Damon. You think we could put both our names on that? What? You've done nothing but eat Breyer's and smoke pot for the last six months. Oh, that's Come on! I helped. Oh, yeah? Okay, write a line. Just right now. - Just pitch me a line right now. - Okay. How about that? - That wasn't a line. You just farted. - Is there anymore pot? So, how was your first day, Mr. Kotter? Yeah, Chris. What's it like to have Brian as a teacher? It sucks! Mr. Griffin gave me an F on my first assignment! What? An F, Brian? After all Chris has done for you? Yeah. Just kind of pull it out. Yeah. If dogs aren't supposed to eat dentaI floss out of the garbage why do they make it mint-flavored? Chris, when I was in schooI, you know what we used to do when a teacher gave us a bad grade? - What? - We'd egg his house. - Come on. Where's this bastard live? - I'll show you. That's his house! - Take that! - I got it! Take that, you bum! What the hell are you doing? - Is that him? - Yeah! Oh, crap! Hello, class. Mark Twain here, filling in for Brian Griffin. I understand you children read my book, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Yeah, we read it. Now, who can tell me Bobby, stop screwing around back there! Who can tell me the significance of the carpetbaggers in my noveI? Yeah. They stood for corruption and greed. That's exactly right. Just like the presidency of James Garfield. He died in office. You kids are mighty smart. You must have a powerfuI good teacher. Well, I gotta catch my time steamboat back to the 1800s. - Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything? - Yeah! Cap'n Crunch was here. Didn't you pass him on the stairs? Well, I hope the rest of you kids learned something today. Yeah. Good morning, this is PrincipaI Sloan. Mr. Griffin, you've been reassigned. Please report to RemediaI English. Reassigned? Can I at least come down to your office and talk to you about this? No. I'm afraid I'm far too busy today. Estoban, mucho tension lower. Little lower. Lower. Lower. On top of old Smokey Gosh, I was really starting to like this job. It was nice interacting with intelligent people. I usually hang out with an idiot. Brian, check it out. I made a water slide in the house. I'm not gonna call the hospitaI because you won't learn anything if I do. Well, kids, I'll see you later. Pardon me. Is this first-period English? I'm your new teacher, Mrs. Lockhart. Oh, my God. I'm in love. Watch out for the stairs! - Good morning, class. - Good morning, Mrs. Lockhart. I graded your quizzes from yesterday. Most of you did well. Some of you, I think, can do better. What do you see here, Chris? Two D's and an F. Hi. I'm Mr. Griffin. But you can call me Brian. Mr. Griffin is my father. Well, has anybody read Huckleberry Finn? all right. How about we go around the room and everyone can say a little something about themselves? Let's start with you there in the front. My name's Tim. I'm 28 years young. And I love weed. My name is Carlos. And beneath my tough exterior is a boy aching to learn. And beneath that is a rapist. My name is Amanda. And my water just broke. - Oh, my God! - Yo, it's my turn to deliver. Can I have this one? My mom keeps giving mine away. Dad, I need some advice. I need to know how to get a girI to like me. Chris, buddy, there's a million ways to do that. You just got to do something simple, like Vincent van Gogh. It's What is this? It's my ear. Do you like it? You don't like it. No, I like it. But it's just Why your ear? Because I love you. Well, at least this will be a funny story to tell our kids someday. You want kids? Oh, yikes. I wish you'd told me that before I got you this. Did I hear my big boy say he's got a crush on some lucky girI? You know, Chris, I knew this day would come. So, I brought you a condom. Use it wisely, though. It wasn't easy to obtain. What the hell are you doing? Give that back! Man! Now, where were we? This is much better. Chris, honey, the way to win a girI is to do something romantic and unexpected. Remember the naked spaceman, Lois? Yeah. You remember the naked spaceman. On my 25th birthday, your father surprised me by showing up in nothing but a space helmet and moon boots. It just came to me. - You want some Tang, Mr. Spaceman? - Do I? Just remember, fat man, those jugs are mine untiI the milk dries up. Then you can have the remains. So, basically, what Orwell was saying was, ""It's not perfect but I'll take it. "" all right, moving on- Sorry, I'm late, Mrs. Lockhart. Oh, my God, Chris! What are you doing? Being romantic and unexpected. Chris, you can't be so impulsive. People have gotten into a lot of trouble that way. - Marie? - Yeah, Donny? We cannot tell Mom. So, Chris, what's the latest with your little girlfriend? I don't think Mrs. Lockhart likes me at all. Mrs. Lockhart? Your teacher? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Lois, this is not my Batman glass. Peter, are you listening? Chris has a crush on his teacher. Gross! You know what else is gross? Broke a damn blood vesseI! How's it coming, dog? God! Just listen to this kid's report on Great Expectations. ""Miss Havisham should have throwed that cake out so it don't like ""mess all up the bitch's house. "" I don't know what to do, you know? Society's given up on these kids. I feeI like I may be the only one who can help them. I think your problem is you're not communicating in a way that speaks to their experience. You know what you should do? Get in there tomorrow and do the robot. Wow. You know, you're right. Maybe I should just try a whole new approach. Thanks. Okay, you can stop that now. I can't hear you. I'm a robot. - Come on, knock it off. - Does not compute. - I'm going to bed. - I do not require sleep. Let's see the kid with the hearing aid from Barney do this. all right. So's I'm chilling in Verona when my homie busts out with: ""Yo, Romeo. Check out that biotch Juliet in the window. "" Problem is, Juliet's peeps are, like, East Coast rappers and my posse's representing West Side. Just like my boys Tupac and Biggie. Know what I'm saying? - That's racist, man. - Yeah, that's just straight ignorant, dog. It's good to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin. We wanted to talk to you about our son. You see, Chris really- Lois, honey, let's make sure we do this delicately, all right? Mrs. Lockhart, our son would like to plow you. I had a feeling that's what was going on. Sorry. Our son can sometimes be a boob. I mean a melon. I mean, a sopping-wet pair of breasts barely covered by a racing t-shirt. Mrs. Lockhart, we just wanted you to know so you could spare his feelings and let him down gently. Don't worry. I know exactly what to say to Chris. Thank you so much. You've been very understanding. Gosh. You know, I don't mean to impose, but do you have a picture of yourself that I could tape to the back of Lois's head? - Mrs. Lockhart? - Chris, come down here. I need to talk to you. Why are you here? 'Cause I couldn't stand to be away from you for another moment. I think I'm falling in love with you. - I love you, too! - The only problem is I'm married. Therefore, there's only one thing to do. Make a flip book of a stick figure whose head gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then pops? This isn't a flip book, Chris. They're instructions. If we're going to be together, I need you to kill my husband. Do you have any idea what time it is? Get in the house, fatty! Chris, you big beautifuI man, I'm so glad you came. Up the stairs, second door on the left. He should still be asleep. - Mrs. Lockhart, I don't think I can do this. - What? Maybe you could just get a divorce, and we could live together in the fort under my bed. Fine. I'll do it myself. But we're through. Okay. But I got to give you the password, or you can't get into the fort. It's taco. Taco! Good God! Look at the fat man's underwear. It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting. Don't put that in with my things! What's this? You know, Stewie, Mommy doesn't usually read things out of Chris's pockets. She's more respectfuI than that. Yeah, whatever helps you sleep at night, bitch. Oh, my God! Chris is gonna murder Mrs. Lockhart's husband! We got to stop him! Can we stop at the supermarket? I want a Granny Smith apple. How's your oatmeaI, honey? You know, it tastes kind of different than usuaI. Oh, my God! There's a bear in my oatmeaI. Yeah, I know. I'm late. Okay, let's just get started. Yo, man, what's that thing in the middle? What, this? You got to be freaking kidding me. That's an ampersand. It's a symboI for the word ""and. "" My God, nobody can be this stupid. Not even Peter when he took that blow to the head and thought he was Larry from Three's Company. Jack, there's a hot tub party across the street and we're invited. And don't worry. If Mr. Furley comes by, I'll make sure he thinks you're Mr. Griffin, chillax. We're doing the best we can. There is nothing I would like to do more than chillax, Amanda. But without a decent education, you could spend the rest of your life as a ditch digger or a moteI maid or a hooker. - I could be a ditch digger? - A moteI maid? I could be a hooker? Well, no. You don't want to be a hooker. Wow, Mr. Griffin! You're the first teacher that ever told us we could do anything. Well, I didn't mean sell your body for money. ""O, Captain! my Captain! "" No, you're actually misunderstanding. ""O, Captain! my Captain! "" Well, if it works for you, I guess ""O, Captain! my Captain! "" What the hell? Be the best damn hooker you can be. ""O, Captain! my Captain! "" In your case, I'd get the money up front. Jack, twins! Swedish. My place. Now. We're too late! Oh, my God. Okay, I gotta call the police. What's that smell? Dead body, right. That's what that is. I just had a dream I was an egg, and I was being hatched by Elisabeth Hasselbeck. No, wait a minute. I can't call the police. I have to get rid of this body, or Chris'll go to prison! And we all know what happens in those prison showers. I've seen Oz. Scrub scrub here, scrub scrub there Whether you're white or bronze A man can wash another man in the merry old land of Oz all right, wait here, Stewie, while Mommy gets the cement blocks. - Everything all right here? - Fine, Officer. Just enjoying the sunset. No law against that, is there? - What happened to your shirt? - You know, just a pizza party at the office. Yeah? Where do you work? First Fidelity Insurance over on Wabossette Street. - My cousin, Arnie, works over there. - Arnie's your cousin, is he? - You know him? - Somewhat. Good middle-management type. Just blends in with the furniture there. Never really wowed anyone at the office. Yeah, that's always been Arnie's problem. Well, take it easy. Yes. You, too. And if you see Arnie, tell him: He'll know what it means. You know what I hate? A guy in a blue suit. There's one right behind me, isn't there? You know, Lois, Chris is cooI and everything, but since he killed that guy I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't be living with us here now. Peter, I'm scared. Don't worry, sweetheart. You'll have plenty of time to escape while he's killing Meg. He hates her the most. Hey, everybody. What's for dinner? I'm starving. My God, his blood lust is unquenchable! Chris, why don't you take your sister into the kitchen for a sandwich? I don't want to die! Why is everybody acting weird? Chris, honey, we know what you did. And I have to say, honestly, I don't approve. What I did? That I lied about my age to get into Indian Bingo? No. That I had hard gas and pooed myself? Close, but still no. How is that close? For God's sake, Chris! You murdered Mr. Lockhart! What? No, I didn't! Come on. Everybody's done something they're not proud of. Like when I used to be a Wonder Twin. Peter, the old schoolhouse is on fire! Let's go! Wonder Twin powers, activate! Form of a hawk! - Come on, Peter. - Yeah, I'll be right behind you. Shape of Jayna's tampon. And now I play the waiting game. Chris, I saw the body. Premeditated murder is one thing, but I will not have Iying in this house. Wait, hold it. Can we finish this after Joan of Arcadia? Is Joan of Arcadia on? all right. Must be good. Enjoyable program. We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a breaking news story. We apologize to Joan of Arcadia's sanctimonious, fear-based and probably overweight viewers. That's right, Diane. It appears Ronald Lockhart has been brutally murdered by his wife, Lana, and a locaI bear. Well, I'll be damned. Chris, I guess we owe you an apology. That's okay. I just wonder what happened to Ms. Lockhart and that bear. The whereabouts of these suspects are currently unknown. - You ready? - What's that? I thought we'd try that lobster place we passed in the car. - Yeah, can I just finish watching this? - You can watch TV anytime. I'm starving. Lana, this is gonna be a reaI long trip if you don't knock off the crap! Love you."

Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who Positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy I must say I do feeI a strange satisfaction watching the black ball topple all those self-righteous white pins. Can't blame them for being self-righteous. The black ball's in their neighborhood uninvited. The black ball's done nothing wrong. If the black ball's innocent, it has nothing to fear. Wonder what the hell's down there. Judd Hirsch? Hey. What's going on? Nothing. all right. Hi, boys. Your ride is here. Hey, you're just in time. Mort's one ball away from a perfect game. Oh, God.

You're lucky I've got some extra pull around here thanks to my 18 medals for heroism. There he goes again with the medals. Hey, Joe, if you love your medals so much, why don't you marry them?

He was watching me go to the bathroom. Well, clearly he thinks you're attractive, Lois. It's a positive thing. Thank you, Glenn, for complimenting our family. We have had it with his disrespect for women. We're petitioning the city to have him removed from the neighborhood. Yeah, I don't want to bring a new baby into the world with him running around. First of all, Bonnie, you've been pregnant for six years, all right? Either have the baby or don't. Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy. He's just a little mixed up. - This isn't medium rare. - Then have them take it back. Sorry about that. Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy, you know? He's just a little mixed up. That's all. Come on. Give him another chance, eh? all right. But one more incident like the one at the bowling alley and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood. Now, don't worry about a thing, Quagmire.

Peter, are you sure Quagmire is ready to be out in public? Nothing to worry about, Lois. We figured out a foolproof rehabilitation method. I got the idea from when Brian had to wear that cone after his operation. Okay, if I make this, we're all gonna get laid. Yes! Score! Score! Boy, I'd really like to chew on my crotch right now. Okay, Quagmire. Time to take off your training wheels. Okay, I think I'm ready. Oh, boy. - What's the matter, Glenn? - Nothing.

You're always getting medals for catching crooks. Hell, even Cleveland used to be an accomplished auctioneer. I have 125. Do I hear 130? $130,000 for this authentic Comanche headdress? I got 130. Do I hear 135? 140? Do I hear- I'm the only one here who's got nothing, you know? If I die tomorrow, there's nothing people would remember me for. Not if you jumped off a skyscraper and landed on Joan Cusack. People would say, ""Hey, remember that guy who landed on Joan Cusack?"" Well, things are gonna change. From this day forth, people are gonna know the name Peter Griffin even if I have to shout it from the rooftops. You hear that, world? I am gonna do something that people will remember me for. Oh, God! Sorry, sorry. Hey, Joan Cusack. Hello? Oh-oh. Peter, if you'd just let me talk, I'll explain to you why you shouldn't do this. Later, Brian. I gotta do something people will remember me for which is why I've invented a new type of flying machine. You know, I vaguely recall seeing footage somewhere of something exactly like this that leads me to believe this probably won't work. all right, Stewie. Let her rip. all right we attack the Rice Krispie guys at dawn, assuming Judd Hirsch delivers the goods. Brian, this time, I think I got just the thing people will remember me for. I am gonna stop pollution with my new lovable character Gary the No-Trash Cougar. Pick up your trash! I want to know whose cup this is. I said I want to know whose cup this is! Pick it up! Thank you, sweetie. See what a nicer place this is when we all pitch in? Like Gary the No-Trash Cougar says: ""Give a larbage, throw out your garbage. "" Spread the word. Those freaking elves, man. They just came out of the trees, man. - They just came out of the trees. - You saved my ass back there. You saved mine. - Here's to Snap. - To Snap. This sucks. I've been working on this all week and I keep coming up dry. Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna be remembered for anything. Not like my great-great-uncles, the Siamese twins who fought each other in the CiviI War. - I'm seceding. - Like hell you are. Not too smart, huh? Yeah, did not think that one through. Peter, you have to stop comparing yourself to other people and find out what's speciaI about you. In sadder news, the man who held the Guinness World Record for most drugs ever done by a single human being died today. He was attacked by a pack of wild dogs he thought he saw. There you go, Peter. You could break a world record. What, are you nuts? I got no speciaI talents. What can I do that nobody else does? Well, you just ate my tip. I got it! Peter, you're really putting away those Mentos. These aren't Mentos, Lois. Everybody, you're looking at a guy who's gonna set a new world record. I am gonna eat more nickels than anyone has ever eaten before. Setting this world record is gonna make me famous just like the world's fattest twins over there. - Did I tell you that I'm doing Atkins? - Oh, that's not good for you. - Dad, I just don't hear it. - Come on! Really, Peter. It just doesn't- You're telling me that doesn't sound like Camptown Races? Not one bit. Do Short People! This is the worst use of money since I tricked out my big wheeI. Hey, ladies, check out this ride. Yeah. I'm off to make trouble for the establishment. I love you, Lois. I love you, too, Peter. Even if you are full of nickels. Goodnight, honey. Oh, my God, Lois. I can't see. How about now? No, nothing. Well, that makes me feeI much better. You can't see the spaceship, either. My cousin Marshall insists if you look past the picture you can see a spaceship. Can you please just tell us what's wrong with my husband? Oh, yes. You see, after ingesting such a large number of metaI coins Mr. Griffin appears to have succumbed to nickeI poisoning causing him to lose his sight. Oh, my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat. I can't see a damn thing. You know what else you can't see? The writing on the wall. Vaudeville's dead. And TV's the box they're gonna bury it in. Back then, everybody had a specialty. I, for one, am a tumbler. Watch me leap through this big hoop. Vamp! Vamp! So we're all gonna have to pitch in and help your father out now that he's lost his sight. Nobody took care of me when I lost my arms and legs and was struck blind, deaf, and dumb. Hey, Meg, they got a Happy Days spoof in here but they call it Crappy Days. all right, you know what? If you're not gonna laugh, then I'm not gonna keep you company. This sucks. Now the only thing anybody's gonna remember me for after I die is being that blind guy. Don't give up yet, Peter. I mean, many blind people live rich, fulfilling lives. I don't know, Brian. I mean, I guess I can give it a shot. Oh, my God, I almost didn't do it. I almost didn't do it. I thought, ""Is this in bad taste?"" But you know what? I went for it. I went for it and I am so glad I did. Oh, worth it. Totally worth it. - Hey, you still awake, Lois, honey? - Dad? That's right. I'm your daddy. Don't talk, Lois. Don't talk. Just let me do all the work. Yeah. Now feeI my warm breath on the nape of your neck. My hands on your big soft boobs running down your big manlike Holy crap, it's Chris. So, how're you doing? You do all your homework? Finish all your subjects? - Yes, sir. - Good. Just checking. Have a good night, Son. You still awake, honey? What the deuce? - Peter, what the hell is that? - This is my Seeing Eye dog, Brutus. What do you need a Seeing Eye dog for? Well, because I can't do anything for myself, Brian. I can't drive. I don't know when to cross the street. And I took a dump in the church confessionaI which I guess they frown upon if you're not homeless. I thought I could deaI with being blind at first. But I don't know. I haven't felt this out of place since that week I lived with Superman. We must stop Lex Luthor before he irradiates the world's supply of gold. Hi, sorry. I know you got a meeting going on. But So we are officially running low on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-Its. So just putting it out there. If you're heading to the store later you know, 800-mile drive for me, like, five seconds for you. Whatever. I'm not here. Peter, this is something you're still adjusting to. You can't expect to get used to it overnight. Whatever you say, Brian. I'm going to The Clam. Did Peter leave? Yeah. Boy, he's really down about this. I know. I'm so worried about him. I've been looking into support groups we could join to help him. - Are you not wearing makeup? - No, I just You know, since Peter went blind it's actually been kind of nice not to have to worry about my appearance. I see. Is it really noticeable? Well, a little mascara wouldn't kill you. I was kind of thinking I'd try an au natureI thing. You think you have the skin for that? Oh, let me light that for you, babe. - Wow! - Yeah, magic fingers. - Jesus Christ! - What? Get the Escalade. We're out of here. Come on, girI. I'm thirsty. all right, you don't want to come in? Fine. I'll just tie you to this parking meter. Hey, Horace. I'll have a Pawtucket Patriot. So how's your hammer hanging? Is somebody smoking in here? Hey, you ever watch that show Scrubs? Lois had it on the other night and I was kind of fading in and out. But, you know, I was watching and I'm wondering, which one is the funny guy? Peter, grab my hand! - Jeez, Horace, you been drinking? - Grab it and pull! Come on, let's go. And here comes the heroic blind man. Tell us, sir, how did you summon the courage to save your friend - from that burning building? - That freaking place was on fire? And there you have it. Coming up next, watch me shave. Peter, you're all right! I am so proud of you for saving Horace's life. Yeah, Peter, you were amazing. You know, Brian, I guess I was. And you know what else? People are gonna remember me for this."

I was wondering if maybe you'd want to I don't know, go out sometime. That's about as likely as me playing by someone else's rules besides my own which I would never do. I play by my own rules, nobody else's. Not even my own. - How about a movie? - I don't go out with dudes. - Mom, Dad, am I ugly? - Of course not, sweetie.

Not if we do a 1980s fixing-stuff-up montage. Well, I think we made it worse. Boy, I do not envy whoever has to clean that mess up. Brian, why don't you take Stewie while Meg and I go clothes shopping? You know, it's awfully dangerous for me to be walking around the mall at my height. - I say, let me get on your back. - Oh, for God's sake. Strong with the force, young Skywalker is. - God, I don't believe this. - That is why you fall. What about this, Meg? A pink baby tee that says ""Little Slut?"" - That seems pretty hip. - I don't know if that's really me, Mom. Well, they've got one that says ""Porn Star"" and another that says ""Sperm Dumpster"" and they're all written in glitter. all right. all right. Give me ""Sperm Dumpster. "" That's the spirit. - You finding everything okay? - Yes, thank you. - You just let me know if you need any- - How do these jeans look? - $10. - $5. - $8 and I'll do it. - Fine. Help, I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement! Help me! I am so outrageous. Give me the cash. - Cold in here? - Nope, just really small. Face it, Mom. No matter what I wear, I look ugly. Meg, you're being That's Let's try down here. Coming up next, Joan Rivers speaks to us from beyond the grave. But first, let's go to the Quahog Mega-Mall where Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa is handing out makeovers. That's right, Tom. Some lucky hideous woman will be transformed by our makeover magicians into someone of value to society. Meg, that's it. You could get a makeover. That'd be just the thing to boost your confidence. Miss Takanawa! Miss Takanawa! Over here! My daughter needs a makeover like there's no freaking tomorrow. It looks like we've got a winner, Tom. - Face it, The Clam is doomed. - Come on, guys, we can't give up now. Peter, we've tried every theme we could think of and everything's falled. Especially that Coyote Ugly theme. It's no use, this place is finished. Quagmire, go get the ""For Sale"" sign. Hey, Horace, what the hell's this? It's a karaoke machine. I never got around to installing it. A karaoke machine? Wait a minute, that's it. We'll turn this place into a karaoke bar. Oh, man, that's the best idea since they faked the moon landing. Okay, cut. NeiI Armstrong. Wait a minute. You're supposed to be on the moon. I just saw it on TV. There's a tape delay. And solar winds Peter, take a look at your daughter. Oh, my God, Lois, I'm sorry. It was 20 years ago. - I'd never even heard the word ""rubber"" - Peter, this is Meg. Oh. I got a makeover, Dad. Don't I look great? Meg, honey, I always thought you were beautifuI just the way you God, couldn't do that with a straight face. Welcome to the family, sweetheart. Chris, go burn all Meg's old pictures. There's got to be a morning after We're moving closer to the shore I know we'll be there by tomorrow And we'll escape the darkness We won't be searching anymore Thank you very much. I don't understand it. This place should be jumping. Well, we just need to kick it up a notch. Horace, hit it. Just a small town girI Living in a lonely world She took the midnight train Going anywhere Peter, don't make me do Just a city boy Born and raised in South Detroit He took the midnight train Going anywhere Oh, God, I love this song. And I love it when amateurs sing the Iyrics. But I hate baseball cards. Some will win Some will lose Some were born to sing the blues The movie never ends It goes on and on Hey, that's Journey. Kickass! Howard! That is Journey. Streetlight people Get some! Get some! Guys, we were freaking electric. Yeah, they loved us. Gentlemen, this is a sign. We are gonna start our own rock band. Who's with me? I'm in. Looks like the guys are gonna form a rock band. Maybe they'll learn a little something. Stick around, you just might learn something, too. You know, Peter, just because you guys entertained a bunch of drunken idiots at a karaoke bar, doesn't mean you have what it takes to form a band. Brian, you're just ants at a picnic. We're gonna be awesome. Wait. What am I? I'm ants at a picnic? Is that what you just said? I'm ants at a picnic? all right. Just making sure. Sorry I'm late, fellas. CooI, Glenn. You look just like Tommy Lee. Well, I figured it'd be appropriate since I just found out I got hepatitis. You know, maybe we should have decided on outfits that matched. Now we all look like a bunch of queers. Fellas, it doesn't matter what you wear as long as you play kickass rock and roll and do this with your tongue. - Am I right, Gene? - You got that right, Pete. Oh, my. Hi, Gene. I didn't know you were here. all right. Keep it in your mouth, rock star. - Great job getting hot, Meg. - Gee, thanks. - Hey, Meg. - Hi, Craig. Now that you're attractive, how about we go out sometime? Gosh, I'd love to. Great, I'll pick you up whenever I feeI like it. Hey, Meg. We noticed Craig Hoffman just asked you out. That makes you cooI. Wanna hang out with us? - Sure. - Hey, I'm here to pick you up. Here we are, fellas. Our first major gig. Peter, this is a house of corrections. You gotta start somewhere, fellas. That's how you evolve. Like when the Tin Man found out he was gay. Look what happened by accident. I hear there's a lot of buzz about this band. Yeah, there was a pretty positive review carved in Tony's ass. all right, kids. Now everyone stay together. It's very important to your father that we're here for his band's first performance. The people who beat you are proud to present, all the way from Quahog Fat, Horny, Black and Joe. - Hello, Cleveland! - Hello, Peter. One, two, three, four Oh, my God, we don't know any songs. - You suck! - Get off the stage! What do we do? I know what I'm doing. I'm getting out of here. How about a funny story about Lake Wobegone? It was the day of the tuna hot-dish jamboree Oh, no. Kids, your father's in trouble. - I'm going up there. - I'm coming, too, Mom. Oh, my God. The guy behind me braided my hair. Chris, grab a guitar. Brian, take the drums. Here, Stewie, play with this. Mom, can we please just get out of here? - Oh, my God. - Who is she? God, I could strangle her all night long. Boy, that's not healthy, is it? That that's the first place I go to? Hit it! Cloudy skies and rain clouds Have come to stay Windy nights and sad sights Won't go away But I wanna be without a care Unicorns and butterflies everywhere Gonna buy me a rainbow Gonna wrap it up in a great big bow The time is right It's day, not night Just open up your heart It'll be all right Gonna buy me a rainbow Buy me a rainbow You guys were great. My name's Jimmy lovine. And I'd like to make you filthy rich rock stars. Wow, you're the chairman of Interscope Records. - What're you doing in prison? - I stomped a cat to death.

Gonna buy me a rainbow Buy me a rainbow - How was that, Dr. Ditty? - Yo, that sounds smooth, y'all. I just have a- God, I'm so sorry. I keep doing that. God, please forgive me. I get that from my father. He's from a different generation. - It's- - Whatever, man. - We cooI? We good? - Yeah, we're cooI. Fine. Mr. Doctor? If you get shot in a rap feud can you perform surgery on yourself? Well, no, Chris. My degree's in optometry. all right, Dr. Ditty. I got three choices for you for the name of the band: Peter Griffin Starship, Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers or Testicular Sound Express. I think the name is Meg. - Me? Why? - Yeah, why? Let me explain something to you, all right? We got to get her half-naked and put her out front, center stage. And that's gonna make y'all billionaires because America loves hot, white jallbait ass. Wait a minute. That's the smartest thing I've ever heard anyone say about anything. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg being exploited that way. Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision. I want to be exploited. Meg, don't you talk to me like that. Look, Lois, I love MeaI Ticket just as much as I love Chris and Stevie but business is business. So, let's get this show on the road, huh? Good. Now, I just need you to sign this. Oh, God. Sorry. Oh, my God. That is not me. That's not who I am. I vote Democrat. It will not happen again. We cooI? We good?

Stewie and I have been working on some stuff of our own. And we thought there might be a place for us to sing on the next album. Hey, cooI. You're busy. No sweat. Boy, Benson was a funny show. - I'll talk to you later. - Well, what did he say? He said he'd think about it. Okay, so where were we? Okay. I want to have intercourse with you Intercourse with you Relations. Intercourse with you - Right? - Yeah. No, great, that sounds good. all right, groovy. Now, is there a shorter word for intercourse? Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles. - Excuse me, young lady? - Did I freaking stutter? - I said more Skittles. - all right. That is it, Meg. You know, ever since you got that makeover you've developed a terrible attitude. And all the success with the family band is only making it worse. The family band? You know, maybe you haven't noticed, Lois, but I am the band. - Right, Missus Wong? - Yeah, she band. Old lady jealous. Peter, we have to do something. We're losing our daughter. I'm worried about what's happening to her. Lois, this is the kind of thing that always resolves itself if you just ignore it, all right? What's more important is we're living the sweet life. This is even more fun than when I performed at the White House. Mr. President, I present to you Peter Griffin. Okay, listen up, everybody. I got great news. Meg, you and your family are gonna perform on Saturday Night Live. You mean I'm gonna get to meet John Belushi and Gilda Radner and PhiI Hartman, and Chris Farley, and Horatio Sanz? Sweet! Saturday Night Live. I can't think of anything more exciting. Oh, my God, a water fountain! Meg, I'm Jimmy Fallon. It's great to finally meet you. I'm hosting. Why don't you come hang out in my dressing room? - What are you looking at? - Nothing. Come on, let's go. Peter, I'm worried about Meg. She's spirallng out of controI. I mean, what if she develops a coke problem? No Coke. Pepsi. Come on, you set me up for that one. Wow, Jimmy. That was everything Ladies Home JournaI said it would be. Awesome, great, thanks. You know, there's something I There's something I gotta tell you. Being with you just made me feeI so Live from New York it's Saturday Night! It's Saturday Night Live. Oh, my God. Yeah, that wasn't a very good opening sketch, was it? - A rare miss. - I don't think that was a sketch, Peter. Mom, Dad, he used me for comedy. Wait a minute. Are you telling me that my daughter was deflowered in front of one-and-a-half times the Mad TVaudience? My poor baby. My God, Lois, you were right. Why the hell didn't I see it coming? all right, stand aside. It's about time I did my fatherly duty. I said ""duty,"" but no time to laugh about it now. Hey, everybody, it's great to be back. So we got a great show tonight and- Hey, Fallon, say goodnight, you bum. And this is for laughing and looking at the camera during every sketch you've ever been in. Who do you think you are? CaroI Burnett? You think because she did it, it's okay for you? You haven't earned what she's earned, buddy. all right, now where's the guy who slept with my daughter? I'm so glad to be the reaI me again. It's too much work being beautifuI. Not for me, but it's good to have you back, pumpkin. Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do. Listen, thanks, everybody. I had a great time tonight. I want to thank Jimmy Fallon for being such a good sport. Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris, the guys from the prison Counting Crows. If I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry. Goodnight, everybody! Our thoughts are with you, Chevy! From the world famous Apollo Theater in Harlem it's show time at the- What? I'm tired. It has nothing to do with the fact that it's a black show. What? I can't be tired at 1:00 in the morning?"

                    			It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who Positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy Peter, thanks a lot for having us out on your boat. - No problem. - Peter, are you sure Santos and PasquaI don't mind coming in on a Saturday to serve us drinks? Are you kidding, Lois? They're Portuguese. Work is their cocaine. Besides, look at them in their tuxedos. They look like little people. Hey, Meg. What's going on? What's going on? You having a good time? Yeah, no, I'm having a good time. Hey, what's going on? Listen, you're 17 now, right? I was just throwing it out there. I was thinking, you know, if you ever want to I don't know, screw around or something. Hey, Joe. So, you know, it's just something to mull around in the old noggin. Damn. What is it about golf that always brings out the worst in me? So, Annika Sorenstam, you're quite the female golfer, aren't you? Yes, quite the female golfer. I knew it! Look! Everybody, look! Look! She's a fraud! all right, I caught a fish! Sorry about that, Loretta. Hey, can I have my fish back? You're gonna have to reach into the cookie jar. Well, I can't just You're my best friend's wife. Reach into all right! Yeah, you go in and get that. Show that fishy who's boss. Loretta, they have some of that three-bean salad you're so fond of. Hey, Quagmire. Well, we'll have to do this again sometime. You name the time and the place, little neck. I've always loved charades. - Your turn, Joe. - The category is Famous People. - Okay, guess who I am. - Ironside! - Larry Flynt! - Stephen Hawking! - Dr. Strangelove! - Roy Campanella! - Richard Petty! - Lance Armstrong! NeiI Armstrong! Stretch Armstrong! Stretch Cunningham! Howard Cunningham! Potsie Weber! Natalle Wood. Definitely Natalle Wood. - Somebody save him, he can't swim! - He's not even kicking. - Kick, Joe, kick! - Peter, he's a paraplegic. That doesn't mean he can't hear. Kick, Joe, kick! Somebody help him! Gay! You were right, Peter. It was Natalle Wood. Lois, why the hell do we have to take a stupid CPR class? Because, Peter, none of us knew what to do when Joe was drowning. Now, be quiet and pay attention. Hi, there. I'd like to welcome you all to CPR. I see a lot of smiles here in this room. There's one. There's another. That's good. I see that soda up under your chair. That's all right. Soda's all right on my watch. We also got Oreos here and fresh coffee. Everybody likes a snack. Now, who wants to go first? No takers? Well, fine. I'll go first. Peter, why don't you volunteer? No, I don't volunteer for anything since I helped those guys repaint the Sistine ChapeI. Listen, I thought the stuff that was there was kind of lame. So I put this up. I figured Andre the Giant would be a little hipper. Get back some of those boys you scared away. And that's pretty much all there is to it. It's hard, jagged, and tastes like alcohoI. Just like kissing Faye Dunaway. Easy now. I can't believe we just did that. But, you know, that stuff about spending the day together tomorrow I forgot. Actually, I have a thing. But, you know, you have my e-mall address. So drop me a line. And then I'll have yours. And we'll take it from there. So Bellybutton. Well, I'll see you later. So, it's officiaI. Y'all are card-carrying lifesavers. Holy crap, a card with my name on it! I am now Peter Griffin, certified CPR. Come on, Lois! I've got lives to save. Thanks. Be safe. Nobody had any of the coffee. Only a couple of Oreos gone. I'm gonna take the rest home to the cats. Sorry, I was diallng the phone. Are you all right? Don't worry about it. Doesn't look like there's any- Peter Griffin, certified CPR. Don't anyone panic! - What the hell are you doing? - You know, I don't think he's hurt. I'll get to you in a moment, sir. I'm gonna have to check and see if he soiled himself. - Sir? Sir? - What the hell is wrong with you? - I've got to check if you've soiled yourself. - Get off of me. Are you crazy? Sir? I'm gonna need you to stop struggling, all right? - Leave him alone. - I hurt my elbow! - I've got to get these trousers off. - Somebody call the cops! - I gotta see if you soiled yourself. - Nobody asked you to get involved! Get off him, you jackass! I'm gonna need you to step back. all right, Looks like we're clean down here. You guys take it easy. No need to thank me. Just pay it forward. - So they revoked your CPR card, huh? - Yeah. This is worse than when they took away my library card for reading while intoxicated. Don't be ashamed of your hand, Johnny Tremain. You still live in exciting times. Crap! Sir, do you know how loud you were reading? ""The life of a silversmith's apprentice was not an easy one! "" I got to figure out some way to get that card back. You could always take the class again. I mean, I'm sure they'd give you another card. - Hey, do you hear that? - What? Sounds like someone screaming. What is it, boy? What are you trying to say? It sounds like Loretta is screaming. - Trouble at the old mill? - What are you, insane? - Somebody fall through the ice? - It's summer. Bobcat? Loretta's in trouble? Come on, boy! Peter Griffin, temporarily suspended CPR - Holy crap! - We should go. Boy, that was embarrassing, huh? Walking in on Loretta and Cleveland having sex. - Peter, that wasn't- - You know, for a large, heavyset black guy, Cleveland's got a cute, little white ass. That wasn't Cleveland. It was some white guy. - What was that? - Shut up and put some more of that sugar in my bowI. Wait a minute. Brian? If that wasn't Cleveland doing it with Loretta then Loretta's having an affair. We can't tell anyone about this. That is the last thing in the world we want to do. What a day! We've done everything in the world. So I guess the only thing left to do is tell you that Loretta Brown is having an affair. - Good Lord! - Oh, no! Oh, God! I'm screwed. This is worse than that time I had to fess up to the nation. My fellow Americans, I have not been entirely truthfuI with you. I did ga-googity that girI. I ga-shmoigedied her ga-flavety with my googus. And I am sorry. Yeah, any idea who it was, Peter? No, we didn't see his face. all we know is it's a skinny white guy with a tattoo on his left butt cheek. Well, I better tell Cleveland. I got a knack for delivering bad news. I don't know how to tell you this, Mr. DeVanney. So I'll let these guys do it. You have AIDS Yes, you have AIDS I hate to tell you, boy, that you have AIDS You've got the AIDS You may have caught it when you stuck that filthy needle in here Or maybe all that unprotected sex put you here It isn't clear But what we're certain of is you have AIDS Yes, you have AIDS Not HIV, but full-blown AIDS Be sure that you see That this is not HIV But full-blown AIDS Not HIV, but really Full-blown AIDS I'm sorry I wish it was something less serious. But it's AIDS You've got the AIDS So, listen, Cleveland. The reason I asked you out here I've been wanting to talk to you about something. In Superman II, what is the story with that cellophane ""S"" that Superman rips off his chest and throws at the bad guy? Prepare to be destroyed, Superman! - What was that? - Yeah, take that, you jerk. - That was a minor inconvenience. - Yeah, well, that's the idea. - Slowed you down. - I'll say. Ow. - Didn't see that coming, did you? - No. Yeah, well, you know, take that. Which actually brings me to my next point: - Your wife's cheating on you. - What? Yeah, it's actually a pretty funny story, true story. Brian and I walked into your house and she was with some guy going Bam, bam, bam. - Peter, maybe- - Hang on, I'm not done. Bam, bam. And then she's all, ""Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. "" Bam, bam, bam. You want to take it from here, Bamm-Bamm? Bam-bam, bam-bam. - You want to take it from here, EmeriI? - Bam! So that's what we're deallng with here. Any thoughts? Loretta, is it true what they're saying? Were you really having carnaI relations with another gentleman? I'm a woman, Cleveland. I need some passion in my life. I need a reaI man. And Lord knows that ain't you. Well, I admit after a long day at work, I don't always come home with that ""Riunite on ice, that's nice"" mentallty. And for that, I apologize. Apologize? I cheat on you and you apologize to me? Cleveland Brown, you are pathetic! I disagree, but I respect your candor. Goodbye, Cleveland. I love you. Hi, Cleveland. - Hey, what are you doing here? - Loretta kicked me out. Cleveland, I am so sorry. You can stay here as long as you like. Cleveland, sit down. I want to sing a little song that kept me going when I had troubles. We were at the beach Everybody had matching towels Somebody went under a dock And there they saw a rock But it wasn't a rock It was a rock lobster Rock lobster Rock lobster Yeah, you're gonna be okay. Now, everybody, Cleveland's gonna be staying with us for a few days. That's right, kids. So just treat him like one of the family. You mean like Cousin Janine who we're polite to but then mock her diabetes on the drive home? She can't eat carameI. Exactly. Can I touch your hair? I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna touch it. It's like a sheep! You know, Peter, I'm a little worried about Cleveland. His wife cheated on him, kicked him out of the house and he doesn't seem at all affected by it. He's probably bottling up his emotions. That's not good for you. Right. I almost got an ulcer after you shelled out $200 for tickets to Crossing Over with John Edward. I'm sensing an ""A."" Does your name begin with an ""A""? - No. - A ""B""? - No. - C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P? - ""P""! Peter! My name's Peter! - Is your name Peter? Wow, you are some kind of sorcerer. What Cleveland really needs right now is to learn how to express his feelings. Now, what he needs right now is a revenge lay. And I know just who to talk to. - Oh, God! - Sorry, guys. Let me throw something on. - Peter, look! - Holy crap, that's the tattoo! Well, I think we're about to find out who the culprit is. - Peter, I- - Shut up, Brian! I'm sleuthing. - Hello? - Quagmire? - Yeah. - Hey, it's Peter. What's going on, buddy? We're at your house. Peter, he's the one we saw sleeping with Loretta! Oh, my God! Damn it, I knew this was gonna happen! I didn't mean it, you know? I knew it was a mistake! It never felt right! Please don't tell Cleveland! Well, all right, Quagmire. Cleveland, Quagmire's sleeping with your wife! - What? - Quagmire slept with Loretta? Oh, my God, Cleveland! I am so sorry. I can only imagine what you must be feeling right now. It's okay. It's okay? It's okay to be betrayed by your wife and best friend? Better it be Quagmire than someone she could get a disease from. Cleveland, don't you see? This is why your wife left you. You don't have any passion. Sometimes a woman wants to see her man be a man. You got to push back a little! You got to get a little rough! Oh, God! Peter, hit me! Yeah! Wow, so that's something, about Quagmire and Loretta, huh? Cleveland, we got to get your manhood back. Now, the first thing we're gonna do is take you to a good, old-fashioned, wrestling match. all right, Cleveland. Nothing like a good smackdown to get the testosterone going. I must be in Quahog 'cause all I see is a bunch of hicks! You take that back, Macho Man Randy Savage! Doesn't he make you so mad you just - want to go down there and hit him? - No. Well, maybe not him 'cause he's kind of big. But don't you want to hit the guy sitting next to you? Not him 'cause he's kind of big, too. But don't you want to hit his kid? Take that, Macho Man Randy Savage. You jerk. all right, Cleveland. If this doesn't light a fire in your belly, nothing will. Hey, look at me. I'm Quagmire. I had sex with your wife. Those are so his mannerisms. - Peter, what the hell are you doing? - I'm not Peter, I'm Quagmire. - And I'm doing you, Loretta. - What the hell? - You like that? Yeah. - Hey! - Much better than Cleveland. - Peter, knock it off! - Get you damn hands off me- - You like it dirty, don't you? What the hell are you doing? What is that in your pocket? - Lois! Somebody! - Quagmire's got you. Yeah. Glenn Quagmire, you're dead! all right, calm down, Cleveland. I'm gonna kill Quagmire! Oh, God, you're hyperventilating! Chris, get me a bag. Okay, Cleveland, breathe into the bag. It'll calm you down. - Peter, I'm not sure that that's- - Not now, Lois! Okay, Cleveland, Cleveland, relax, relax, relax. Relax, relax. There you go. There you go. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. - It's all gonna be okay. - Peter, you better do your CPR. There's no time. I got to go warn Quagmire while I got the chance. Quick, to the Peter copter! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, my God! - Peter, what the hell? - Joe, get inside! - The blades are still spinning! - Oh, my God, Peter! What is that thing? - Joe! Get inside! - It's tearing up my yard! - Oh, my God! - No! - Joe, I am sorry, buddy. - It's okay. Look, it's okay. - Are you okay? You all right? - It's okay. I'm fine. - Everybody's fine. - That was scary. - Peter, what are we doing here? - Trust me, Quagmire. Cleveland will never think to look for you at Mayor West's house. - Hey, there. - How you doing? Good evening, gentlemen. Listen, Mayor West, my friend Quagmire here's in trouble. - He needs a place to stay tonight. - Say no more. I'll protect you, sir. It is my job. I only ask that you do not feed my cat, Bootsie as he's already eaten and might throw up. Well, Derwood, now you really are the big man of the house. Mother, change him back. You know, Endora, I'm getting a little sick of this crap. You ever seen one of these? Huh? You know what this is? Huh? - No! - Yeah, it's holy water. Huh? Yeah. Try it. How's that feeI? You like that? Power of Christ compels you, bitch. I hate Bewitched. Hey, so that's a pretty reasonable reaction, huh? It's all right to go to sleep, my friend. I'll stand guard. Okay. Don't worry. I'll be here all night. Just don't try to make me smile. I'm forbidden to smile. Oh, no. That episode of Growing Pains when Mike's friend Boner ran for student counciI. Boner. His name was Boner. - I've falled you. - This is kind of creeping me out. - I'm gonna go. - Take this, for protection. What the hell's this for? When the time comes, you'll know. I'll teach him to mess with my wife. Hi, Cleveland. Will you be joining us for dinner? - Okay, then. - He's a Rocky machine! Peter, we have got to do something about Cleveland. I think you created a monster. Well, there's only one thing to do, Lois. We've got to get Loretta and Cleveland back together. And I know just how to do it. To the Hinden-Peter! Oh, my God! Joe, I am so sorry. How can you afford these things? Yeah, Cleveland, this is Quagmire. Listen, I feeI awfuI. Why don't you come on over and we can try to get things back to the way they used to be? Remember how it was? Perhaps here there are many unsuspecting foxes to have sex with us. That is why we wear tight pants to show our bulges. - We are two wild and crazy guys! - Two wild and crazy guys! You guys look stupid. Anyway, let's talk this thing through. Hey, Cleveland. I was just leaving you a message. You violated the sanctity of my marriage. When the time comes, you'll know. Damn it! This is awfuI! Somebody stop them! Do something! Good. Let the hate flow through you. You're not helping! I can't. It isn't in me to cause harm to anyone. No matter how much someone has harmed me. I'm sorry, Cleveland.

Cleveland? - Loretta, what you did was unforgivable. - This marriage is over. - Well, that's just fine, Cleveland. 'Cause I am through being your wife. Well, I may not be perfect, but I deserve better than you. Look at that, Lois. As beautifuI as an HBO minority fairytale. But, Peter, their marriage is ending. Look at the bright side, Lois. It's a chance for a fresh start for both Cleveland and Oh, my God! What are you doing? - What's wrong with you? - What the hell, man? - Hurts, doesn't it? - What the hell Yes!

Oh, God, I always get these. Okay, all right, fire truck. Fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, fire truck, what color are those red fire trucks? Oh, God, I can picture them now, all red and everything. That's right, Peter, they are red. Lois, what are you doing? I switched Peter's questions to the pre-schooI edition. Just to let him have his moment. Good thing I just watched that NationaI Geographic speciaI on fire trucks. A solitary killer, the fire truck stalks its prey. The fire truck can consume eight times its body weight. The ambulances will have to wait their turn.

Peter, you do know that all your questions were incredibly easy. Yeah, easy for me. Good night, morons. You ever stop and think, ""Wow, I'm married to that guy""? No, I just repress it. - Is that healthy? - What's the worst that could happen? I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor, I'm a tumor Oh, oh, oh, I'm a tumor The administration's plan for peace in the Middle East is shallow and pedantic. I agree. Shallow and pedantic. I agree as well. Shallow and pedantic. Everything all right. Peter? Well, Lois, since you asked, I find this meatloaf rather shallow and pedantic. What is this, you're gonna talk down to everyone just because you won a game of TriviaI Pursuit? Perhaps. Okay, you know what? Fine, you are a genius, Peter. As a matter of fact, let's make it officiaI. You ever heard of the MacArthur genius grant? Perhaps. Well, if you quallfy as a genius the Foundation will give you a $500,000 grant just to sit around and do whatever you want. Wow! Imagine what a genius like me could do with all that money. all right, Cloris Leachman, I've bought you legally. Now juggle these beanbags. I don't know how to juggle- God help you, Cloris! Juggle the beanbags! You may begin your exam now. A dog says A cow says Of course, of course. Well, here they are, Brian. My test results. Read them and weep. Peter, according to this, you're not a genius. In fact, you're mentally retarded. Oh, yeah? Well, would a mentally retarded guy have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver to leveI half of his house in celebration of his fantastic test results? Maybe. Uh-oh. Congratulations. So, as you can see, you are just over the line of mentaI retardation. Don't you mean, just under the line? I'm sorry. Just please trust the analysis. Hello. Sally? Hey, it's Peter Griffin. That's right, senior prom. Yeah. Yeah, it's been a while, yeah. So, listen. I just found out I'm retarded. And I'm just calling to let you know you might want to get yourself tested. Hello? Peter, mentaI retardation usually happens before you're born. It isn't something you can catch. Don't you think you're overreacting? Well, excuse me for being retarded. My whole world has been turned upside down. Black is east, up is white. You know, Peter, I hate to say ""I told you so"" about not being a genius, but yeah! In your face,! I'm sorry about that. I can't believe this is happening to me. I can never go back to schooI again. Oh, yes, Meg, yes. Yes, everything was going swimmingly for you untiI this. Yes, this is the thing that will ruin your reputation. Not your years of grotesque appearance or awkward sociaI graces or that Felix Unger-ish way you clear your sinuses. No, no, no, it's this. Do you hear yourself talk? I might kill you tonight. Peter, you're still you. No piece of paper from the city is gonna tell me you're any different from the man I married. And your life's not gonna change because of it. What is that? Oh, my God, what are they doing? Why are they trying to publicly humiliate me like this? I mean, what's the purpose Shiny red ball. Peter, watch out! So what can I do for you, Peter? Well, Joe, I need to talk to you about something kind of personaI. - Shoot. - Well, you know, I took this test and it sort of turns out that I'm technically mentally retarded. And, you know, I just wanted to ask you know, how do you deaI with it? - DeaI with what? - You know, with being retarded. Peter, I'm not retarded. I'm handicapped. Now you're just splitting hairs. Hi, Cleveland Hi, Joseph What's the story, morning glory? What's the word, hummingbird? Have you heard? Peter Griffin is slow Can he still drive a car? Can he drink at a bar? Will they let him have kids? Is his life on the skids? Hello, Mrs. Griffin, it's your neighbor, Quagmire Now that Peter's mentaI You probably have some needs He's retarded Peter is He's retarded Peter is He's retarded Peter is slow Griffin. Party of two. Mr. Griffin, we've been expecting you. Peter, relax. It's for liability reasons. Now, let's just try to enjoy our meaI. I kind of get the helmet. But what's with the water wings? Well, you did order the soup. Like something could happen Get me out! These water wings didn't help at all. This is the worst day of my life. Now, there are plenty of people who have had worse days. A parking ticket. I was gone five minutes. How could this day get any worse? Oh, my God. Oh, no! I wish I could just close my eyes and make all this go away. Peter, look out! Holy crap! Oh, my God! Mr. Tucker, are you all right? Do I look like I'm all right? My back is broken and my leg is twisted! Oh, my God! Your hooker's dead. Well, she was already dead, but that doesn't excuse Wait a minute. You're Peter Griffin, the retarded fellow. - Yeah. - Well, then don't worry about it. Wait a minute. You mean you're not even gonna call the cops? Oh, my God. I could get away with anything. ""And on the sixth day, God said: ""'Let the Earth bring forth the living creatures and-""' Bible fight! - Sorry. Retarded. - That's okay then. - Don't know any better. - Bless your heart. Jeez, didn't you hear me a second ago? I'm retarded. You're just curious. Well, let me show you how everything works down there. Hey, everyone. Say hello to my state-appointed inspirationaI sociaI worker, Vern. It's truly a pleasure to meet you all. Hey, Peter, looks like you've got yourself one super family. High five! all right! So, Vern, what exactly is it that you do? I'm here to lend a hand to my main man, Peter. - Right, Peter? - Right. High five! all right! Done. - Peter! - What? I don't know any better. Peter, I don't like this. You are really starting to take advantage of this whole situation. Peter's just expressing himself. High five for expressing yourself, Peter. High five! all right! This man seems bent on diluting the already watered-down significance of the elevated hand slap. - Hey, Stewie, high five. - Well, it's about time. - Psych. - Damn! I look even more foolish than when I was at that cocktall party. all right, you're gonna love this. So Hang on a sec. Okay, so these two black guys walk into a bar, and the bartender looks- Hey, what are you guys talking about? I was just telling a joke. So, the bartender looks around and says: ""What'll you two fine gentlemen have?"" And they paid their tab and couldn't have been more courteous. all right, my first trip to a fast-food joint as a retarded guy. Excuse me, pardon me, coming through. SpeciaI needs. Yeah, I'll have a Is this thing on? Attention, restaurant customers. Testicles. That is all. Give me that. Sorry, folks. Oh, my God. Is that what my voice sounds like? It's all whiney and nasally. You know what? I'm just gonna get my own food. - Peter, get back here. - No freaking way. The fryolator. I am so taking this. Lois, you look worse than that Rocky Dennis kid from Mask. Rocky, I don't even know what you look like. - Can I touch your face? - Of course, Diana. Oh, God. Oh, God. What is this? What is all this? Am I touching the outside of a house? Oh, God! You're a monster. I'm beautifuI on the inside. Yeah, but, Rocky, there's a limit. What is this now? Does your face have a pelvis? Oh, God, what have I done? I'm the worst husband ever. Make that the worst father ever. Hi, I'm Agent Jessup from Child Services. I'm here to take your kids away. What? Why? Because you're mentally unfit to take care of them. No way! - Oh, my God. - Finally. I can't believe they took the kids away. Well, at least Cleveland offered to take care of them. Sorry you have to share a bed, boys. I'm a little short on space. Have a good sleep. Hey, Chris whatever happened to Geena Davis? She used to be in movies, but she's not in movies anymore. She's attractive enough but when she smiles, you see too much gum. Not a good tooth-to-gum ratio. Chris? I'll tell you tomorrow. Thanks for letting my friends sleep over, Mr. Brown. No problem, Meg. If y'all get hungry, there's some cottage cheese in the fridge. I'm gonna get me a spoonfuI now before y'all have at it. Oh, my God. Craig Hoffman's new car is so cooI. Oh, my God. Totally. I love the color. Really? What color is it? It's like blue, kind of blue-green. It's the same color as his eyes. Wow. I bet he looks so hot driving it. I heard he bought it from his dad. Yeah, I remember his dad dropped him off at schooI in it one time when he was a freshman. - Doesn't his dad live in Hartford? - I think so. My aunt Sheila lives in Hartford. They have a mall there that's pretty cooI. It's part underground. That's awesome. Damn it, you guys are boring the crap out of me. It's stupid, mindless chatter, is what it is. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm just gonna go back to my place and rent a dirty movie. This is ridiculous. That was weird. Oh, well. Hey, let's compare breasts. Lois? Hey, how you doing, honey? Listen, there's no toilet paper in the bathroom so, I'm just gonna There we go. Oh, God. Hang on! The doctors still don't know how much longer she's gonna have to be here. I feeI horrible, Brian. I put Lois in the hospitaI, and I lost the kids. This is turning out worse than Stewie's iPod commerciaI. Peter, you just need to show what a good father you are. Then you can get the kids back from Cleveland. Wait a second, Brian. You're right. And the best way to do that is to show what a terrible father Cleveland is. This plan is so perfect, it's retarded. Good evening. I'm Dan Rather. And tonight on CBS News seven Saudi soldiers sodomize severaI of Saddam's southern settlement squatters. I'm Dan Rather. all right, come on, ladies. Right this way. This'll show them that Cleveland's not fit to be a parent. So, tell me, is there any tread left on the tires at all? Or at this point, would it be like throwing a hot dog down a hallway? Oh, my Lord. Look who's here. Agent Jessup, look at all these prostitutes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven Seven. Seven prostitutes. This is a shakedown. Mr. Griffin, this isn't going to work. Yeah. Peter, you and five of those prostitutes, get out. So, in conclusion, Peter Griffin, you've inspired me to distrust all mentally challenged parents. Thank you, Your Honor. And thank you, Agent Jessup, for your comically misleading remarks. Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say in your defense as to why this court should return custody of your children to you? Your Honor, I would like to call to the stand my surprise witness The Ghost That Never Lies. But I'm the only one who can see him and hear him so I'll let everyone know what he's saying and doing. Objection, Your Honor. This is ridiculous. Overruled. I'll allow it. You better be going somewhere with this, Mr. Griffin. Thank you, Your Honor. Ghost That Never Lies did you witness the events that took place on that fatefuI day? You did? Well, how interesting. And, do you see the culprit or culprits in this courtroom today? You do? Well, would you kindly point him or them out for this court? Don't point at me, you jackass! Well, if there's nothing further, I hereby sentence- Wait, wait, wait. Your Honor, there is something further. Look, I know I screwed up big time. But I only did it so I could get my kids back. I love them. And I think it's a bum rap that just because I'm retarded that makes me an unfit parent. There are plenty of unfit parents out there who aren't retarded but they get to keep their kids. Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford. I think the Ramseys still got one left. I just want them back, Your Honor, and you're the only one who can help me. What do you say? Are you kidding? You're a monster. In fact, if I could I would put you in a place where you would be removed from the generaI public. Perhaps locked in a big, secure building with other dangerous people for a pre-determined period of time based on the nature and degree of your offense. Unfortunately, as far as I know, no such place exists. So I have no choice but to set you free. Does that mean I get my kids back? Absolutely not. Case closed. Oh, crap! It was prison you were thinking of. Prison. I already banged the hammer. And now, back to Jake and the Fatman. Hey, look over here on the carpet. That's a cigarette butt. This is probably evidence. What do you think was in that Danish? You think it was cheese? 'Cause I got a little problem with cheese. Hey, I'm talking about evidence here. There's lipstick on it. Yeah, well, can you bring it over to me? I can't move it. This is a crime scene. Well, can you describe it to me? You know what? Forget it. I'll take care of this, okay? Oh, no. Just Just let me close my eyes for a minute. Look, I know his wife is a smoker. Just yesterday, when we saw her at the country club she had a cigarette in her hand. What, so that's it, Peter? You're just giving up? I don't know what else to do, Brian. I guess we're never gonna be a family again. - Hi, Peter. - Oh, my God, Lois. - You're all better. - That's right. And the doctors say I'll smell like French fries for the next six months. I'll enjoy that. And, Peter, I got a surprise for you. You got the kids back. I love you so much, delicious French-fry wife. Now we can live with you again even though you're a dangerous retard. Don't say ""retard,"" Chris. We prefer to be called ""little people. "" Because there's nothing wrong with being mentally challenged. In fact, I've learned that we are superior people. Above all you dumb brainy smarties. Someday, you will beg us for mercy and we will consider it. Isn't it wonderfuI that everything's back to normaI? Yeah. Oh, God. Nobody move. - What is it? - Nothing. Nothing. I'll get it."

Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy This is ridiculous. Why did y'all drag me here? Because you can't just sit home every night since Loretta left. You got to get out and meet some women. Well, I suppose I could give it a try. Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black and then have to make a difficult decision regarding whether or not to go back? Sorry, I went burnt sienna and I never went back. Ready, baby? Who's this clown? Open up, Stewie. The airplane's coming in for a landing. I guess the pilot must have been JFK Junior. Even I found that to be in bad taste. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God! Look at the size of that pimple. You're like a circus freak! I'm kidding. You're just becoming a man, sweetie. Yeah. I remember when I became a man. The operation was a success.

The Bachelorette is coming to Quahog. That's, like, my favorite show ever. Meg, how can you watch that crap? That show is not reallty. It's all staged. It's a complete mockery of human relationships.

No, I just wanted to tell him something. No, I'd like to talk to you, too. It's just that- Fine. I'll call you after I talk to Cleveland. I don't feeI obligated. I want to. You're a good pimple, Doug. Feed me. You can talk? That's right. And we're gonna raise some hell. all right! Raise some hell! So, why would you be a good candidate on The Bachelorette?

We still got one guy waiting. You lined up 201 auditions? What a weird number. You're weird. Peter, I can't do this. I am too nervous. I got to go. No, Cleveland, I'm not gonna let you do this. I'll tie you down, if I have to. Peter, this is only making it worse. Oh, God, my claustrophobia is setting in. It's all right. It's okay. It's the fabric. It's your clothes. Let's get your clothes off. Peter, what's wrong with you? I am naked! Oh, God, you're self-conscious. I'm sorry. Here. You know what? Look, Cleveland, look. See? Now you're not alone, Cleveland. Let me out of here! I need to get out of here. Cleveland, no, you're staying. This is for your own good. Oh, my God! Hi, we're here for the interview. Excuse me. Hi. Listen, I just wanted to apologize for Peter. He was just trying to help out his friend. You see, his wife left him and he's been kind of lonely confused about what he really wants. - What's your name? - Brian. Congratulations, Brian. You're gonna be on The Bachelorette. Really? You're sure you don't want to reconsider my friend? Let me see. Oh, that ain't bad! Brian, I can't believe you're gonna be on The Bachelorette. Yeah, I thought you said those shows were stupid. They are stupid. But I figured I got a few days of free booze and food before they kick me off. I could use a vacation. Oh, yeah, because you've got such a heavy workload around here. How you coming on that noveI you're working on, huh? Got a big stack of papers there? Got a nice little story you working on there? The big noveI you've been working on for three years, huh? Got a compelling protagonist? Got an obstacle for him to overcome? Little story brewing there? Working on? Working on that for quite some time, huh? Talking about that three years ago. Been working on that the whole time? Nice little narrative. Beginning, middle, and end. Some friends become enemies, some enemies become friends? At the end your main character is richer for the experience? Yeah? No, you deserve some time off. I am super excited. You think she'll be hot? - I bet she'll be hot. - I think she'll be hot, too. No way! So do I! - Quagmire. - Hey, Brian! - How did you get on the show? - I had to do a few favors. I got to get on that show. Come on, I'll do anything. Anything? - Yeah. - all right. - Okay, you're ready? - Yep. Okay, check under the bed. - No, nothing. - Check in the closet. No, no monsters in here. Now check the bathroom. - No, none in here, either. - Okay, good. - So, can I be on The Bachelorette? - Yeah. Goodnight. Peter, I'm getting a little worried about Chris. all he does lately is sit alone in his room talking to that zit. Relax, Lois. What's a zit gonna do? Talk to him and tell him to sneak out of the house and cause trouble? Now light it, ring the doorbell, and run like hell! - I don't know about this, Doug. - Just do it! Oh, good Lord! Is that Doody! I'm doing the dishes, Joe. I'll change you in a minute. Trevor, this is Brooke, the bachelorette. I wasn't too nervous. When I am nervous I work out. I wasn't working out, so I must not have been nervous. I was very pleased and surprised. I really was not expecting an open bar. Top-shelf booze, I tell you. And this guy knew his stuff. Made me a Mojito. I don't think it's a gay drink. Mojito! Hey, guys. Well, it's been great to meet you all. And I am looking forward to getting to know you while we're here. - Dude, put your pants on. - Shut up. Well, I really like all the guys. But some of them seem a little too competitive. I got to tell you. I don't know what she would possibly see in Count Chocula. I think he's just here because he's a minority. You were right, Doug. Mischief is fun. We're the best pals since the Snorks. I am having a really great time. Me, too. I really value our friendship. You're not like those other Snorks who only want one thing. Oh, that was clumsy. Hang on a second. Gentlemen, it's time for the first rose ceremony. Who gets to stay, and who takes the bus ride home it's up to Brooke. - Trevor. - That's what Trevor's talking about. Hey, can I say hi to a friend of mine? - Sure. - Hi, Jesus! No way! Hello. I know. I saw. Glenn. - Brian. - What? Are you serious? I feeI like I didn't get to know you at all. - Would you accept this rose? - all right. But I think this whole thing is about as pointless as Peter's cow-kite. This is never gonna work. Damn cow. Cleveland, what am I doing wrong? You got to get her running before you start running. Chris. Chris, honey, can I talk to you? Oh, my God, he's gone! That means this room is mine now. I am gonna party my ass off in here. Great pot, Stewie. Yeah, I got it from our cleaning lady's boyfriend. It's okay, though, 'cause she's gonna use the money to get a mammogram. Chris, where have you been? Doug told me I don't need to listen to you. Doug? Your pimple? Oh, that is it! First thing tomorrow, we're going down to Goldman's Pharmacy and get some astringent to get rid of that thing. What did I tell you? She's trying to drive us apart. We can't let that happen. I am in no mood. Welcome to the Saddleback Ranch and our first group date. Is everyone ready for a little cowboy action? - Yeah! - I love horses. Sorry, I am late, Brian. Here's your ride. Oh, come on, you can't expect me to ride that thing. Sorry, we're short on horses. You know what? Forget it. I'll just go smoke. - Hey, there, Adam. - Hello, Henry. I have the power! Brooke, what are you doing here? Oh, I just can't take it anymore. all these guys just coming on to me. I had to sneak off. Oh, could I bum one of those? You know, I don't even know why I agreed to do this show. This is just so not me. I'd much rather just be home listening to my old jazz records. Really? I didn't know. I actually have quite a jazz collection myself. - What do you like? - DJ Jazzy Jeff! I'm kidding! Oh, you got me. Oh, you got me, yeah. No, I really like Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster. Oh, and early Coltrane, before he got clean. Yeah, no junk, no souI. No kidding. I mean, look at Chevy Chase. Right. You know, I got to say, I thought she was just some actress looking for her 15 minutes of fame, but she's pretty sharp, you know. I guess you can't judge a Brooke by her cover. You can cut that out, right? And maybe you can cut out when I said junk earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing. Seems like he's probably the kind of guy who might sue. I mean, the guy's got to have no money left. all right, gentlemen let's see how Glenn's private date with Brooke is going. Hey, Brooke, what do you say, we get you some more champagne? Sure. all right. Hey, forgot about you guys. Well, I guess the date's over. Goodnight, Brooke. Thanks for a lovely evening. Oh, my God, Peter, it looks like there's been a break in. Do you think so? Oh, God, they're back. Whoa, awesome! Totally awesome! all right, Goldman. What the hell is your problem, Mort? I am sorry, Peter. I thought you were one of those criminals who broke in and destroyed my entire stock of acne medication. Oh, my God. Peter, do you think Chris might have done this? Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild streak you had when you were younger. For God's sake, you used to make Plasto molds of celebrity body parts. Okay, DaryI, it's almost dry. Very nice, by the way. This one's going on the shelf right next to Dan Fogelberg. Hey, Lois, am I up next? Just wait in your dressing room. I'll come back for you, Oates. I am not coming back for Oates. Glenn, will you accept this rose? Really? After I drugged you and tried to have sex with your unconscious body? - What? - Yes.

I can't believe I got sucked into that phony reallty world just like everyone else. I became the very thing I was mocking. I know it hurts now, Brian, but look at the bright side. You have some new materiaI for that noveI you've been writing. You know, the noveI you've been working on. You know, the one you've been working on for three years. You know, the noveI. You got something new to write about now, you know. Maybe a main character gets into a relationship then suffers a little heartbreak. Something like what you've just been through. Draw from a reaI-life experience. Little heartbreak, you know, work it into the story. Make those characters a little more three-dimensionaI. A little richer experience for the reader. Make those second hundred pages really keep the reader guessing what's going to happen. Some twists and turns. Little epilogue. Everybody learns the hero's journey isn't always a happy one. Yeah, I look forward to reading it."

Now, if you'll just sign here.  - Well, this is odd. - What?  Well, you're 42 years old and it says here you've never had a prostate exam.  No, but I've had other exams. Like that one in college.  Damn it, this is too hard!  Here's what I think of your test, Mr. Teacher.  You just stood up to me. Congratulations. That was the test.  Heaven helps the man who fights his fear  Yeah!

I was raped.  - What? - Dr. Hartman violated me.  He took my innocence.  What?  Peter, that's a prostate exam.  It's an important part of a physical for men your age.  You sound just like him!  Fucking idiot.  Hey, Peter, buddy. How about some TV, huh?  We now return to Freddy Got Fingered.  Oh, God.  Ouch.  Oh, God.  Yellow Pages. Let your fingers do the walking.  - Are we still going to the baseball game? - Get that away from me, Chris.  Stop it, Meg.  Peter, I'm trying to be supportive, but after all, it was just a prostate exam.  You weren't there, Lois. You weren't there.  Who's that? Who are you? Where's Peter? Where is he?  You're a whore. Wear your whore makeup, you whore.  Is somebody in there? - Ocupado.  Filthy whore.  You're somebody's father, you filthy whore.  Hi, sweetie.  Look at her staring. What are you looking at, huh?  God, I should take her out right here with these, man.  Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring? Oh, why don't I give you a closer look?  Yeah, you want some of this, Maury Po'bitch?

We'll go to Hawaii. Would you like that? I always envisioned how it would be.  I never knew there could be such a thing as a perfect day.  Don't frolic too much, Rupert. Save some energy for the hula contest.  Stewie, I have a surprise for you. Good as new.  Rupert! It's really him. I don't believe it.  You You did this for me?  And to help you feel better, I made your favorite dinner.  Cut green beans.  Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged according to size from largest to smallest,  and a Scooby-Doo yogurt with Shaggy's eyes scratched out.  Oh, it's perfect down to the last detail.  Lois, I was wrong about you.  You're You're my everything.  Mommy loves you, sweetheart.  Stewie loves Lois.  - Brian loves Olympia Dukakis. - Oh, yeah, I do.  Peter, what's the matter with you today? You're not yourself.  Guys, I went to Dr. Hartman yesterday, and he did things to my fanny.  Peter, it's okay.  It's not okay. You don't know what it's like.  You're wrong.  I, too, have felt the cold finger of injustice on my insidey parts.  He He did it to you, too?  I have something to say. Dr. Hartman violated me, as well.  I only went in there for a physical/ guinea pig removal,  but I turned out to be the guinea pig for his sexual experimentation.  You guys are a bunch of queers.  And so am I! Oh, God, it was horrible!  I scrubbed, and I scrubbed, but damn it, they don't make water hot enough!  My God, we've all been victims of Dr. Hartman's ""prostate exam. ""  Well, gentlemen, the abuse stops here. I will not turn a brown eye to this.  I am going to sue that bastard and make him pay out the ass.  No ifs, ands, or buts. I'm going to be really anal about this.  Sphincter.  Good morning, Lois.  My, Stewie, you're in a good mood today.  Well, why shouldn't I be?  You saved Rupert's life, and I love you for it.  So, warn the villagers. Here comes the cuddle monster.  Oh, Lois, your breasts are great.  Well, good morning, Mr. Nipple.  Hey, there. Must be cold in here.  What do you say we move south a little bit?  There we go. Oh, you are so ready.  Peter, you're going to sue Dr. Hartman?  You can't do that, all he did was give you a prostate exam.  Are you saying I asked for this to happen?  You know, Dad, there's this lawyer at the mall  who says he'll take any case,  no matter how frivolous.  Yeah, yeah, and they also have an Orange Julius.  Just Just trying to keep the conversation going.  Well, whatever happens, I'm not going to stand for this.  Too many people get away with injustice.  Like the folks you meet in those Louisiana swamps.  Excuse me, do you know how to get to town?  Yeah, it's back the way you came.  I love you, Lois. You know that, right? Just in case, I'll say it again. I love you.  Oh, you are just so cute, sweetie. Look at that little foot.  I'm gonna eat that foot. Give me that foot, it looks delicious.  Don't Don't eat my foot.

Could you  - Could you not talk to Lois anymore? - What?  You know, it's just I'm tired of you hitting on her.  That's all.  It's I mean, it's not cool.  I was just making coffee. I didn't hit on her.  Besides, Lois is my friend. I'll do whatever the hell I want.  I'm asking you nicely, Brian.  - Stop hitting on her. - That's ridiculous.  - I see the way you look at her - Just 'cause you're a mama's boy  stop! Lois is my queen, man. - Kissing up to her, monopolizing her  - Keep hitting on my woman - You know what, fine! I do hit on Lois!  And another What?  Sorry, I fell asleep watching Sabado Gigante last night.  Lois, you know what we should do right now?  We should play restaurant with my Play-Doh.  I'll make you a hamburger.  Perhaps I'll make it blue. Oh, can you imagine such a world?  Uh, Stewie, I love you, but you're wearing Mommy out.  Now, it's time for bed.  Hey, Lois, I have a secret for you.  You're awesome.  Our top story, a local woman loses her sex drive  after a $125 dinner at Alfredo's.  But first in medical news, Dr. Elmer Hartman,  beloved family doctor to all of Quahog, is the target of a molestation lawsuit.  The trial is set to begin tomorrow.  We now return you to Native American What's Happening!  - Hey, Rerun, you see Dwayne? - Not today.  - Oh, here he come. - How, how, how.  Peter, I don't know how much more I can take.  Stewie used to be so independent,  but now he just clings to me night and day.  I'm exhausted.  Oh, look at me, I'm Lois. The sun revolves around me.  I'm the one who's got to go to court tomorrow.  Peter, isn't there anything I can do to talk you out of this lawsuit?  Hey, I was violated sexually, and that man is going to pay.  And I suppose it wouldn't matter if I told you for the 50th time  that it's a legitimate medical procedure to test for cancer.  Lois?  Lois? Lois? Lois? Lois? Lois?  Mom? Mom? Mom?  Mommy? Mommy? Mommy?  Mama? Mama? Mama?  Ma? Ma? Ma? Ma?  Mum? Mum? Mum? Mum?  Mummy? Mummy? Mama? Mama? Mama?  - What? - Hi.  Is it not true that you went to see Dr. Hartman for a simple prostate exam?  No, I went for a flu shot.  At first, I thought he was nice and that he was kind of handsome.  I trusted him, and then he told me to bend over.  And then, I just felt like something was wrong.  I tried to get him to stop, but he kept saying, ""Relax, I'm a doctor. ""  - This is ridiculous. That never happened. - Sit down, you rapist!  Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm supposed to wait until I've heard everything.  - Go ahead, Mr. Griffin. - And that's when things got bad.  He made me feel so dirty.  Relax, I'm a doctor.  Your Honor, I can't believe you're even listening to this.  For God's sake, you're a patient of mine.  I gave you a prostate exam last year, don't you remember?  Come to think of it, I remember it as a pretty standard exam.  Are you sure, Judge?  Are you sure it wasn't all evil and grainy and black and white? Think about it.  Relax. I be a doctor.  Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty!  Dr. Hartman, your medical license is hereby revoked.  That's outrageous!  God, I've looked forward to this moment more than the second coming of Jesus.  Okay, everybody,  I know you were expecting something else,  but as science will tell you, people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago,  so let's try to be adult about this.  Uh, no snickering and  Hey, that's exactly what I'm talking about.  Okay, so if we can all be mature Give me the gum.  We can all get through this a lot faster.  I have so much fun when we hang out, Lois,  and I love your hair.  We should make up a name for your hair color.  We could call it, like, strawberry sunset or ginger maiden,  or one of those hair color names that's a random noun, like temptress.  Oh, at some point, you have to let me braid it!  Lois, what are you doing?  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What's happening to me?  I'm like that Texas woman who gave her son brain damage  by holding him underwater.  I'm just like Barbara Bush!  Brian, what kind of a mother has homicidal thoughts  about her own baby?  I'm a horrible person.  Lois, you're just exhausted.  Somehow, you've got to break Stewie of this new overdependence on you.  Well, it's worth a try.  Lois, I've got a surprise for you. You and I are going to see Eddie Money!  Two tickets, won them on the radio. We're gonna have a ball.  God, he's like a totally different person. Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Sulu.  Oh, no, I never should have drank those chemicals.  Hello.  Peter, congratulations on taking down that monster, Dr. Hartman.  Yeah, what'd you do with your pain and suffering money?  I got collagen.  Hey, Lois, want to make out?  Yeah. What do you think of new sexy-lips Peter?  Yeah. This is your life from now on. Enjoy it, lucky wife.  I tell you, boys, this is a victory not just for my anus, but for anuses  Oh, hang on, I got to go pee.  That's a lot better. So, anyway, this is a  Oh, I got to take a leak.  There we go. Oh, pee time.  Peter, you're urinating unusually frequently.  Yeah, what gives?  If it's gale-force peeing you be doing,  it could mean you've got barnacles on your prostate.  Best have sick bay check below your decks.  Wait a minute. Are you telling me I need a prostate exam?  Aye, and soon, before your rudder jams with flotsam,  and you're dropping anchor without an order from the Captain.  - How're you liking all these nautical puns? - Cute.  - Not bad. - Somewhat entertaining.  My God, I'd better see a doctor.  But no doctor in town will see you after that lawsuit.  Well, then, I'll just find a doctor out of town.  Listen, I know I'm not a regular patient,  but I think I have some trouble with my prostate.  So can you help me out, Dr. McCoy?  - What, so you can sue me, too? - Oh, come on, it'll only take a sec.  Forget it. I'm a doctor, not a patsy.  Hello.  Lois, what are you doing? I want to sleep in your bed.  Oh, good night, honey. I love you. This is for your own good.  Lois, where are you going? Lois? Lois? Lois, answer me!  Damn you, I will not be ignored! Get back in here!  Get back in here and love me!  Lois!  Maybe I should go in. He's so upset.  He's just being melodramatic.  You've got to ignore it if you really want to help him.  - Are you flexing? - What, me? No. Why would I be flexing?  I mean, I have sort of been hitting the gym,  so if you wanted to see how it's going  What am I going to do, Seamus?  Dr. Hartman is my only hope, and there's no way he's going to see me.  Well, you best come up with something, Peter.  Otherwise, this will happen to your prostate.  You just carry a picture of a diseased prostate around with you?  Never know when it's going to come up in conversation,  and then who's the one who's prepared?  I've also got a map of Middle-earth,  a cat doing a pull-up, and the guys from Primus.  These poster jokes doing anything for you?  - Eh, hit and miss. - We should hang out more.  I need her love. I need her love, and she's ignoring me.  Well, let's see her try to ignore this.  Lois, help!  I ate this whole jar of pills that look like candy and now I feel sick.  - You look like a jackass. - Can't hear you, Brian. I'm dead.  All right.  What did you do?  Oh, that is so not cool.  Mommy, I'm dying! I'm dying!  I said I'm dying!  Hey, I'm dying up here. What is this? A Tommy Lee pool party?  Come on, Lois, get with  Oh, my God. Stewie, are you all right? Oh, my sweet baby.  And to think I ignored your cries for attention.  I'm so sorry, honey. Never again, Stewie.  I'm going to give you all the love you could ever want.  Forget it, you neglectful, swag-bellied measle.  You had your chance and you blew it. Well, now you're too late.  I hope they charge you with child abuse for my broken arm.  I'll testify against you, just like I did against Michael Jackson.  Stewie, did Mr. Jackson behave inappropriately toward you?  Well, yes, but the worst part was he never called back.  No, but in all seriousness, yeah, he was actually pretty aggressive.  Package for Dr. Hartman.  - All right, where's the package? - Here it is.  So why don't you go ahead and open it up and reach on in there?  It's probably cookies or something.  Wait a minute, there's something strange about this.  I wasn't expecting any package.  - Who are you? Griffin! - You got to help me, Dr. Hartman.  I think there may actually be something wrong with my prostate.  Well, don't look at me. I lost my license, thanks to you.  Look, I know what I did was wrong, but you're the only one I can turn to.  So, I'm asking you,  as a man with no more options, will you take a look in my ass?  Despite everything that's happened,  I suppose I can't ignore my Hippocratic oath.  All right, drop your pants.  Oh, well, this is nothing, just a little swelling.  Probably a minor infection. Looks like there's some blockage.  - What the devil is that? Hello.  Dr. Hartman, your license is hereby reinstated.  Oh, I'm so glad you two worked things out.  And to think I actually thought you raped me.  Well, I was going to, but you ran out of the room.  What?  Family Guy was recorded on tape before a live audience."

And we're out of time.  This has been The Lunch Hour.  Join us next week, when our guest will be Gore Vidal.  And remember, life is full of entrees,  so don't fill up on bread.  I'm going to throw you now to Weenie and The Butt  in the afternoon.  Weenie and the Butt!  Ninety-seven point one!  In the afternoon.  Oh, my God.  WQHG!  Turn it on and rip the knob off!  You're listening to the radio!  Sir, I'm very sorry.  That-that was this guy I know. He thinks he's hilarious.  He is hilarious!  I was on my way in here to cancel your show,  but the banter you did with that guy,  well, as we say in the radio business,  ""If you put that on the radio, people will listen to it!""  Make him part of the show.  Oh, you-you don't want him.  He's not really a professional like me.  Listen, you get that kid in here.  We need more laughs on the show.  Well, I guess he couldn't be any worse than Tim McCarver is at sportscasting.  In my view, as good as the Yankees were in the first half of this game,  that's how as bad they've been now.  Poor Peter, I know he's having  a hard time with this whole divorce thing.  I feel kind of guilty that I'm here looking for a date.  Thelma, stop that.  You have a right to be happy.  And-and there's a lot of great people here  Why don't you mingle?  Oh, my God, Lois, you single now?!  No, Glen, I'm here with Thelma.  - Who's Thelma? - This is Thelma.  I don't know if this is gonna work, Lois.  I'm a little shy at these types of things.  Oh, you can overcome shyness.  Think of the spider in Charlotte's Web who had to overcome Tourette's.  I don't know, Lois.  I haven't met a single interesting person.  Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker  trying to get back on my feet  after having my ass handed to me by my bitch of an ex-wife.  I'm Thelma.  I'll just be going.  Can I get you some punch?  Oh, no, you see, if you're one of ten million Americans like me  Like me.  with a bladder control problem,  punch just goes right through you.  I didn't hear you come in last night.  Did you have a good time at your prostitutes convention?  Peter, I was just trying to help your mother meet some new friends.  Lois, you're too nosey.  Like that waiter at that restaurant.  And who had the prime rib?  I hardly think that's any of your business.  Come on, Mom, you can't stay in bed all day.  You got to call dad and get back together with  Holy crap!  We'll have more on these new developments after this.  I can't believe what I saw in there.  You were messing around in what was basically  my first apartment.  Peter, you should be happy for her.  She's just having fun.  I don't see what the problem is.  Tom is a wonderful man.  I don't see the problem, either, but let's go to Ollie Williams  for the inepth analysis. Ollie?  Lady's old!  Thanks, Ollie, over to you, Peter.  Tom Tucker, I forbid you to see my mother.  Peter, you can't talk to Tom that way.  He won a local Emmy for his work with the retardeds.  They certainly wanted to hug me.  Maybe in time, you will, too.  Thanks for watching, I'm Tom Tucker. Good night.  All right, look, let's get one thing straight, Stewie.  The only reason you're here is that my boss ordered me  to bring you on.  All right, this is my show, and it's a serious,  intellectual hour of discussion and I want to keep it that way.  Hey, no problem.  All right, in three, two, one  This is The Lunch Hour with your host  Hey, what's up Quahog?!  From the station that reaches the beaches,  you're listening to Dingo and The Baby!  Dingo and the Baby.  97.1 Quahog!  Oh, baby!  What the hell are you doing?  Wha-What the hell does that have to do with anything?  They're just wacky sounds, you know to liven things up.  D- i-n-g-o!  D- D-Dingo! Dingo and the  Baby!  Oh, sexy girlfriend!  Peter, would you stop spying on your mother's date?  I can't stand it anymore, Lois.  I'm going to put a stop to this.  Hello?  Uh, hello, yes, uh, this is, uh, this is Tom Tucker's personal physician,  Dr. T and the Women.  Um, could you tell Tom his contagious penis cancer medicine is ready.  Is this Peter?  Uh, no, it's, uh, uh, Lois.  Uh, Lois, don't crank call my mother.  I'm gonna have to pinch you for that.  Ow, Peter, don't pinch me!  Ow!  Ow stop it!  Knock it off, damn it!  Cut it out. Maybe I'll tickle you, huh, how about that?!  No, don't.  Here you go, tickle, tickle.  Cut it out!  Stop it!  I mean it! I mean it!  Well, I told you to stop!  I tickle you, you hit me in the head with a frying pan?!  I told you to stop!  I taste blood!  Well, there's a lot of it.  Hey there, champ.  Peter, I know this is all a big adjustment for you,  but all I want is for your mom to be happy.  Well, why can't she go back with my dad?  Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna do  my best to make her even happier than those kids  on Three Wishes with Amy Grant.  What's your wish, Billy?  Can you cure my cancer?  No, but how about if Spider-Man gives you  a $50 gift card to Sears?!  He-Here, get well.  You know, I heard a rumor about you today?  - You did? - Yep.  I heard you like milk shakes.  Oh boy, do I!  Let's go get ourselves a shake, huh?  I want to get a milk shake, too.  Too bad- go get your own father.  Hey, Carl, can I get a carton of smokes, please?  Sure, Brian.  And uh, what's that little rubber mailman  you got behind there?  Oh, you like that, huh?  Yeah, does that thing squeak?  Yeah, it does.  All right, I'll take that, and I'm gonna hurry home  and show it to Lois.  Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere!  You're Dingo, that dog that plays all those fart sounds on the radio!  Awesome!  Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry about that,  the show's gotten a little lowbrow.  What are you talking about?!  It's, like, the most hilarious show ever!  Hey, could I get your autograph?  My really?  Wow, you're gosh, you're making me feel  more important than a dwarf among midgets.  Hey, can you reach the Crispix?  Yes, I can.  How awesome is this: going out to dinner with my new family?  Hi, can I help you?  I want, I want that one!  All right, hold on, we'll get you that one.  I want straws!  We'll get you a straw.  You want a Kid's Meal?  No!  Do you mean, ""yes""?  Yes!  Okay, one Kid's Meal.  And what'll you have, honey?  I'll have a fish sandwich and a Sanka.  Oh, he's adorable.  Say hi to the nice lady, Peter.  Oh, he's shy.  I don't believe in fretting and grieving  Why mess around with stride?  I never was cut out to step and strut out  Give me the simple life  Some find it pleasant dining on pheasants  Those things roll off my knife  Just serve me tomatoes and mashed potatoes  Give me the simple life.  We now return to the Sunday afternoon movie:  Masturbator and Commander.  Captain, the enemy ship has opened fire on us.  I'll be right out!  Sir, we've already lost ten men.  Hang on!  Sir, don't you think we should return fire?  Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do that,  and I'll-I'll meet you up there in like five minutes.  Peter, I've never seen you so happy.  Well, Lois, I never realized what it was like  to have a real dad.  I mean, my own dad was such a ballbuster,  I- I guess I just always thought that was normal.  But Papa Tom is so different.  For the first time in my life,  I feel like I have a real family, you know?  I mean I'm-I'm not just going through the motions  like I do around here.  Hey, champ, you want to watch Chicken Little?  Yeah!  And what does a chicken say?  ""Moo!""  Why not.  Come on, Ma!  Hey, what gives with the suitcase?  Tom, there's no easy way to say this, I'll just come right out with it.  I'm leaving.  Wha  leaving, why?  Tommy, this has been great,  but I wasn't looking for anything long-term.  I just needed someone to clear all the bats out of my plumbing.  What do we do now Bill?  We write, Tim.  We write our story.  Good bye, dear.  It's all my fault!  Nyah!  I know it hurts right now, Peter, but we'll get through this.  You're still my little buddy, right?  Yeah.  Then we'll be okay. Good night, buddy.  Good night, Papa Tom.  Good night, son.  - Good night, Lois. - Good night.  Peter, this is a little strange.  No stranger than when Darth Vader was a meter maid.  Oh, come on, man, cut me a break!  I was only in there for like five minutes!  I already started writing the ticket.  You know, I make your annual salary in a week.  Are you happy doing what you're doing?  'Cause you're pathetic.  I got to do it, Karen.  I just I-I got to take a shot.  That guy, that guy just got to me today.  You do whatever you think is right, and I'll support it.  I don't really understand it.  What do you want this loan for?  I want to build a giant space station that can destroy a planet.  I don't know that that would be a good investment on our end.  I mean, I want to open a sports bar.  Good morning, Quahog!  You're here with Dingo  And the Baby  And if you're thinking about changing the station  Don't you do it!  Today, we got Homeless Hank from the Dumpster out back with us.  Hey, I got an idea:  How about the first three women willing to come down  and have sex with Hank get free boob jobs  courtesy of Dr. John Viener?  Are you reading my mind, man?  Let's go to the phones.  Go ahead caller, you're on with Dingo and The Baby.  Is this Dingo?  Yes, honey, what's your name?  Sindy, with an ""S.""  Ooh, hot.  Oh, yeah, that's hot, that is hot.  Tell me something, Sindy, how'd you like  to come down here and get naked for us?  Sure.  I think we got a show.  Oh yeah, we got a show!  - We definitely got a show! - Oh, yeah, there's a show!  After all, AIDS is a deadly, incurable disease.  But no matter how you come to judge, Charles Wheeler  and his partners' unethical, moral, and inhuman terms,  the fact of the matter is, when they fired Andrew Beckett  because he had AIDS,  they broke the law.  My God, what is wrong with you?  I swear to God, that was supposed to be ""Food Fight!""  I want some ice cream.  No, Peter, you finish your food.  You, hey, you-you get back here, right now, mister!  Don't, don't you get down from that chair,  or you're in big trouble.  You put that ice cream back right now.  I mean it.  I am not kidding around.  I am not going to say it again.  Uh if you put that ice cream in your mouth you're gonna be  in big trouble, young man!  Uh you uh, uh.  I hate you, I hate you!  I want my mommy!  Well I'm the best you've got!  All right, so you know the drill.  We're going to turn on the hot dog cannon,  and for every hot dog that you catch in your mouth,  you get a $100 toward a boob job that you desperately need.  I know.  Okay, here we go.  Oh, a miss!  Aw, you got her in the eye with that one.  Whoa, that one was a teat-seeking missile!  I'm looking for Brian Griffin.  Gore Vidal!  I was supposed to do The Lunch Hour?  Uh this is The Lunch Hour.  That one felt like my dad.  Incest in the morning.  Suppressed memories.  Ninety-seven point one!  I think I may have made a mistake.  No, no, no, no, this is it.  You're-you're in the right place.  Uh, listen, uh, why-why don't you stick around and talk for a while.  My listeners would love to hear about your new book.  Hundred dollars, boob job!  I'm, uh, going to go.  Oh, my God, what have I done?  Hey, it's all about ratings, baby, and we got 'em.  No, it wasn't worth it.  I'm sorry, Stewie, I can't do this anymore.  I'm more of a sell-out than you were when you did  those Butterfinger commercials.  Nobody better lay a finger on my Butterfinger.  D'oh!  What's your problem?  Ah, Papa Tom's being a jerk.  At least he talks to you.  He's my dad and he hasn't paid attention to me in weeks.  Well, all-in-all, you should be thankful.  I think the Kennedys had a kid like you,  and they had it put to sleep.  Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about that business with the ice cream.  I guess I'm just still a little torn up about your mom.  But, hey, I'll make it up to you. Let's play catch.  Okay!  Wait a minute, you know what?  I think you should play catch with Jake.  Really?  Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like to have a real father.  I can't make him share his.  Well, all right, Peter, come on, Jake.  Huh, I guess I've learned a little something  about what it means to be a good dad.  Hey, Dad, do you want to play baseball?  Oh, my God, could you leave me alone!  You are the neediest kid!  I can't believe you gave up our show.  Yeah, sorry.  I wonder who they got to replace us.  It's Magic Hour with Dark Chocolate  And The Rod.  In Rod we trust.  Ninety-seven point one!  Giggity giggity goo!"

                    			Oh, yes!  I slam it, and you can suck it!  Joe, that was our last ball.  Eh, don't worry.  Mr. Moose will help us out.  Won't you, Mr. Moose?  Fine.  Knock-knock.  Ping pong balls!  Hey, hey, guys, look at me.  I'm covered in balls.  - Just like - Just like Sharon Stone.  Ah, you beat me to it.  Man, I haven't had this much fun since I was in that Broadway show.  I'm a wolverine  And my hatred keeps me warm  A wolverine, so you Russians best be warned  Shooting Commies, drinking deer blood  Peeing in the radiator  Look up there, here comes a really angry Russian helicopter  It has been  a red dawn.  Hey, Peter, Lois called to remind you to pick up Meg at the roller rink.  - No! - We're just getting started!  Oh, Meg is my least favorite of all your children.  It's all right, we'll just move the party to the skating rink.  Who's sober enough to drive?  Ah, okay, who's drunk, but that special kind of drunk  where you're a better driver because you know you're drunk?  You know, the kind of drunk where you probably shouldn't  drive, but you do anyway, because, I mean, come on,  you got to get your car home.  Right? I mean, I mean, what do they expect me to do, take a bus?  Is-is that what they want?  For me to take a bus?  Well, screw that.  You take a bus.  I'm that kind of drunk.  Shotgun.  Dad, where have you been?  I've been waiting for over an hour.  Grab some wood there, bub.  Daddy and his friends have been drinking.  And we're gonna keep on drinking until we each uncover  repressed memories of sexual abuse by a trusted religious official.  Oh, that's crazy tal Oh, my God.  Minister Washington, how could you?!  Man, look at all these chicks!  Oh, wow.  Wow. If I were a woman, I would press my bare boobs  up against glass in public  just for the sexual thrill! The sexual thrill!  How do I stop?!  Use the rubber stoppers on the front.  Hey, baby, how'd you like to share a pair of skates?  Sure!  Never mind.  Boy, you look a lot better from the back.  You jerk!  Oh, hey, baby, you want to go somewhere?  No, no, no, no, no.  Wait, wait, Quagmire, remember what's on the other side.  That was awesome!  Oh, my God, that was completely by accident.  That was great fun.  I don't even remember why we came, but I had a ball.  I look forward to reminiscing about this tomorrow.  Dad! Wait!  You forgot me again!  You need a lift?  Oop, didn't answer me quick enough.  Remember those sweet, warm New England summers?  Remember sipping lemonade underneath a shady tree?  Remember when you hit that pedestrian with your car  at the crosswalk and then just drove away?  Pepperidge Farm remembers.  But Pepperidge Farm ain't just gonna keep it  to Pepperidge Farm's self free of charge.  Maybe you go outand buy yourself  some of these distinctive Milano cookies,  maybe this whole thing just disappears.  Meg, what happened?  Fat Ass and his drunk friends left me at the roller rink.  You know, this wouldn't have happened if I had my own car.  Meg, people have always found ways  to get around without a car.  Look at Iceman.  Honey, where'd you go when you went out last night?  Uh, just over to Tom's house.  Played some poker, had some brewskis, you know.  Really?  Then would you mind explaining that?  At least they know how to touch a man.  Oh, walk away.  You know, Peter, maybe Meg having her own car  - isn't such a bad idea. - Yeah, I guess so.  What?! I have been trying to get a sewing machine for months,  but she gets a freakin' car just like that?!  I hate this place.  Look at all these Hummers.  What kind of jerk would drive one of those?  Dude, this car kicks ass!  And I can watch Madagascar while I'm driving!  What kind of music do you like, Gloria?  Hippo-hop.  Dude, those animals are so fucking funny,  they make me want to merge without looking!  Yeah! Rumsfeld!  Hi, there, can I help you folks?  Yeah, uh, my daughter's looking for a car  that goes with her personality.  Yes, are the new bulimic cutting mobiles in yet?  This is a 1996 sedan.  Excellent gas mileage, air bags and AM/FM cassette.  I love it!  Dad, this is the car.  Eh, hang on a second, Meg.  What can you tell me about this one?  Oh, that's just an old tank I use  for those commercials where I declare war on high prices.  Now, about that sedan  Hang on there, slick.  Now I see your game.  We come in here wanting a practical car,  but then you dangle this tank in front of me  and expect me to walk away.  Now, I may be an idiot,  but there is one thing I am not, sir,  and that, sir, is an idiot.  Now, I demand you tell me more about this tank.  Well, if you're looking for quality, then look no further.  That's more like it.  Tell me, what are the tank's safety features?  What a good-looking question.  Three inches of reinforced steel  protects your daughter from short-range missile attacks.  I see. And does the sedan protect against missiles?  It does not.  Ah, you hear that, Meg?  Yeah, it does not protect against missiles.  See, these these are the questions.  This is why I'm here.  Peter, you can't be serious.  This is a 30-ton war machine.  I'm still not sure.  Did I mention the tank is a tank?  Sold.  Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes.  Boccie balls!  I bought a tank!  Are you out of your mind?!  Let me show you how the gun works.  What the hell?!  No, no, no, no, no, no!  Hey, Peter, can you blow that towel rack down here?  Thank you.  Jeff Daniels and Bill Pullman  star in Neil Simon's  The Even Couple.  I ordered a pizza, I hope that's okay.  Sure, I love pizza.  This half of the apartment is mine.  But if you want to come over here, that's okay, too.  This isn't spaghetti, it's linguini.  You're right, it is!  I always get those confused.  Hey, all of us are human.  I'm glad we're friends.  Yeah, this is really working out.  There's no conflict in this movie!  When are you gonna get rid of that stump?!  I've been asking you for months to get rid of that stump!  I'll do it, all right?! Just get off my back!  She's gone.  We can finally be together.  But, Tim, I'm rooted to the ground.  We'll find a way. We'll find a way.  My God, it's hot.  Brian, did you turn off the air conditioner?  Just open a window.  Air conditioners are harmful to the ozone layer.  Brian, please.  Save your hippie B.S. for the winter months, okay?  Hey, Brian. I'm not gonna recycle this aluminum can.  I'm just gonna throw it in the trash.  Ha! you are earth's bitch!  Morning, civilians.  General Griffin reporting for breakfast.  Dad, it's not fair.  My money paid for that tank,  and I haven't even gotten to drive it yet.  Jeez, Meg, you always got to ruin my good time.  Just like basic cable.  We now return to Showgirls.  - Yeah! - On TBS.  Aw.  All right, Meg, you got a feel for the controls.  Now give it a little gas.  Oh, great, it's here.  That mirror I bought on eBay.  Oh, my God!  Joe, my God, what happened?  You just ran over me, you bastard.  I don't know where you got that thing, but I'm impounding it!  Look at you.  You look like a half-empty toothpaste.  We now return to The Ghost Whisperer.  I don't understand.  Why do all you ghosts come to me?  You're-you're really  Um, you have a knack f  We-we just trust you.  I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson confiscate  the closest thing I had to a car.  Relax, Meg, it's not the worst thing I've ever done.  You remember that favor I did for that park ranger?  Hey, Boo Boo, let's see what we got in this pic-a-nic basket.  Tell the other bears what you just saw.  Well, I don't care.  'Cause you know what I'm gonna do?  I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car.  Hey, Meg, I'll pay you a dollar a day to smell my sneakers.  Oh! I peed and pooped.  You know, I read that they're opening a Superstore USA across town.  Maybe you could get a job there.  No, no, no way. You cannot work there, Meg.  Giant mega-stores like Superstore USA  are ruining this country.  They don't pay their employees a decent wage  or give them health benefits.  Oh, yeah, all gay guys hate Superstore USA.  - What? - Hmm?  Hey, I'm just trying to be ethical.  Yeah, right. You hate all megastores,  ever since you were petted way too hard  by that special boy in front of Kmart.  Doggie!  Doggie!  - Doggie! - Too hard.  - I like doggie! - Too hard.  - Doggie! - Gonna bite.  Doggie!  Oh, Jeez.  Welcome to the Superstore family, Meg.  - Glad to have you. - Thanks.  I'm really excited to get to work.  Now, let me just go over a few basics.  You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime,  no health benefits, and every day at 3:00,  you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.  Oh, it's nearly 3:00, now.  Here you go.  You're beautiful.  I would go out with you  if I wasn't already in a committed relationship.  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Oh, Peter, Superstore USA has taken all my business.  Mine, too.  In fact, the only guy in town making any money  is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.  Y'all laughed at me. Y'all laughed at me.  Well, who's laughing now?  What do you think of this?  That makes you attractive.  Yeah!  Well, maybe now, you guys are seeing what I've been trying to explain to you.  That mega store is a big, evil corporation  that means nothing but trouble for this town.  Aw, man, this is the worst thing to happen to this town since  that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.  Looks like someone's a little lost.  Everyone, I have some bad news.  Superstore USA has their own brewery on-site  and can sell beer at a much cheaper price.  So management has decided to close down.  - You mean, I'm out of a job again? - I'm sorry, Peter.  Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house.  Okay, find the Easter egg.  I know where it is. It's in your butt.  No.  Yeah, I know the story, it's in your butt.  Mr. Griffin, if you'd just look on the ground for five seconds  - I'm sure you'd find it. - Nope, in your butt.  - Look, I'm tired of this stupid rumor. - In your butt.  - Mr. Griffin. - Butt.  You know what, just get the hell out of here.  Fine. Weirdo.  So, how was work today, Meg?  Oh, Peter, you lost your job  because of the Superstore, you shouldn't blame Meg.  And you can stop making that fart sound  every time someone says ""Meg. ""  So, how was your day exploiting the town's resources, Meg?  Meg.  Meg.  Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg.  Meg.  I'm not going to sit here and take this.  I'm the only one in this family who has a job.  Yeah, like she'd get paid for that.  What did he just say to you?  Nothing,th-there was  Well, it-it's like if you were  F- Forget it, it's nothing, Meg.  - Hello. I'm Tom Tucker. - And I'm Diane Simmons.  At the top of the news, Quahog is suffering it's worst heat wave in a century.  That's right, Diane.  We now go live to Ollie Williams with the Blaccu-weather report.  How are you beating the heat, Ollie?  - Swimmin' hole. - Thanks, Ollie.  In other news, Quahog will be experiencing rolling blackouts  to help meet Superstore USA's extensive power demands.  Oh, in fact, Channel Five has just received  this message from the Electric Company.  Hey, you guys!  We're gonna turn it on  We're gonna bring you the power  It's coming down the line, Strong as it can be, Through the courtesy  The Electric Company. The Electric Company.  Contrary to those upbeat lyrics,  the Electric Company would like us to emphasize  it will not be bringing you the power.  Great, rolling blackouts.  Now, Superstore USA is siphoning off all the city's power.  And they cost me my job.  Mine, too.  Superstore USA has their own paper route.  That new paper boy done gone and broke my sternum.  Ah, this sucks.  That damn Superstore's ruining everything.  You know, instead of sitting around complaining,  why don't we go down there and protest?  That's a great idea, Brian.  All we need is some magic markers, posterboard, some plywood  Actually, Superstore USA has all that stuff. We can just get it there.  There's one of them now.  Take that for stealing jobs from hardworking people.  Dad, what the hell are you doing?  We got a message for you.  We're here, we're queer, get used to it.  - Uh, actually, Peter - Gattaca, Gattaca!  Peter, I don't think it's working. People are still going into the store.  Well, fine, then I guess I got to go in there and drag 'em out one by one.  All right, who the hell is in charge  Ah ah, wha-what is that I'm feeling?  That's our industrialsized air conditioner.  Wow.  When I walk into Superstore USA, I get the sensation  that I'm standing on a mountain top  with the wind blowing through my hair.  My God, look at this wonderland of treasures.  What would a guy like me have to do to be part of this magical world?  You are trespassing on private property and I must ask you to leave.  What? Are you out of your mind?  Leave this lot, losers.  Unless you want a licking.  And we'd love to deliver that licking, right, fellas?  - Yeah. Love it. - A lot.  I'd love to lick a lemon lollipop in Lillehammer.  God, I wish the power would come back on.  Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward to this job.  Peter, I can't believe you're working for Superstore USA.  How could you sell out like that?  Because, Brian, they have an industrialsized air conditioner.  And I'm tired of sitting in balls soup.  Look, Dad, this isn't going to be a cakewalk, all right?  I'm your supervisor.  Meg, Meg, I promise I'll do better at this job than I did on the SAT's.  Come on.  Do math.  Dad, I need you to  Dad, what are you doing?  Meg, Meg, look, Meg look.  I am so freaking good at coloring.  I know I'm not supposed to go outside the lines,  but I do anyway because I like being myself.  Dad?  Dad?  Dad?  Oh, God, it's so hot.  Uh, Brian, spit on me.  Oh, that's nice.  Now, tell me I'm scum.  - How will that cool you off? - Hmm?  God, it's awful in here.  This is even worse than getting herpes from a toilet seat.  Joanie, it's me.  Oh, hey.  You know, I had such a great time with you last night.  Listen, there's something I have to tell you.  I just got back from the doctor.  I have herpes.  I think you should get yourself checked out.  - Oh, my God. - Will you stay?  What?  Will you stay with me, even knowing that I have herpes?  Yes, I will.  - Joanie? - Yeah?  I don't have herpes.  I just needed to know that you'd stay.  You say  I only hear what I want to  I've had it, the only place in town that's got power is Superstore USA,  while the rest of us are left to bake in the heat.  There's got to be something we can do to take that place down.  Don't worry, Brian, I think I've got an idea.  Oh, yeah.  Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find a assault rifles?  Aisle 6.  How about a list of known local homosexuals?  Aisle 4.  Meg, you're doing a great job.  In fact, I'm promoting you to assistant manager.  Really? Oh, my God.  Thank you so much.  Now, your first responsibility is to fire that employee.  Boy, I'm a little chilly. I hope no one notices.  But that's my dad.  What's more important to you, your job or your family?  And don't pick the obvious one.  Oh, hey, guys, I was just catching up on some plunger nipples.  Dad, um  Go on, Meg.  What are you waiting for?  Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this,  but you're a fat ass who's completely incapable  of performing the simplest tasks.  But you're also my father.  And you're the only one I'll ever have.  So, I'm not going to fire you.  Mr. Penisberg, I quit.  Penisberg?  Yeah, yeah, get it all out of your system.  Meg, that was a wonderful thing you just did for me.  I can't believe this is coming out of my mouth, but  I love y  So, you got a tank.  Big whoop. Want to fight about i  Huh, well, I'm glad that Superstore USA is gone.  That place was nothing but trouble.  And I think we learned something.  Any problem caused by a tank can be solved by a tank.  Dad, you were about to say something in the store.  No, I don't think so.  No, I'm sure of it.  Oh, I don't know, something about Hardcastle and McCormick?  No, you were going to say you loved me.  You love me and you know it.  Hey, hey, mouth, young lady.  Well, you think you'll look for another job, Meg?  Meg!  Meg.  Meg.  Uh-oh.  Pardon me."

                    			It seems today that all you see  Is violence in movies and sex on TV  But where are those good old-fashioned values  On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do  All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a family guy  All right, kids, assembly is starting. Now, please take your seats  for the following presentation by the US Army.  - What's up, y'all? I'm Sergeant Extreme! - And I'm Major Awesome!  We're here to tell you how much the army kicks ass!  Check this out!  The army sounds awesome! And the recruiter said, with any luck,  I could get the clap from a 12-year-old Chinese prostitute.  Wow, that's great. You'll be serving your country,  just like American film legend Mickey Rooney.  Hi. I'm former biggest star in the world Mickey Rooney.  And as you may know, I am totally and completely insane.  I like to yell at mice with my shirt off.  Sometimes, I like to steal other people's scabs.  How do I stay so crazy? Mickey Rooney's Crazy Pills!  Take one with breakfast, one with lunch, and before you know it,  you'll be up on your roof, pooping in the chimney.  Hold out your stockings, kids!  Chris, you can't join the army. You're too young.  Besides, the army is weak.  Now, the marines, those are the men you want to fuck.  Are you kidding, Lois? The army's great! You get to save money for college,  there's free food, and all the brown people you can rape.  I am sorry, but he is not joining the army. Case closed.  I can't believe they're brainwashing kids like Chris  to serve in the military.  Ah, yes, the bottom 10%  of our high-school class is off to fight another battle.  - You stole that from The Onion. - What?  You stole that. I read that in The Onion. About the war in Iraq.  Well, if that's true, then I'd say they've got some sharp cookies over at  What is it again? The Onion?  So if I go up to your room right now,  I'm not gonna find a copy of The Onion, right?  No.  - Damn it! - That's what I thought.  Coming this fall, if you loved Everybody Loves Raymond,  then you'll love his brother Robert even more, in Robert.  I bet you Debra really gave it to Ray today.  I bet you she made a sandwich that wasn't very good, but he ate it anyway.  And then she got mad at him 'cause he gave her a funny look.  I miss Ray.  I can't believe Chris would just buy into that army recruiter's sales pitch.  - We can't let him enlist. - Don't worry, Lois.  All he needs is an after-school activity to get his mind off the army.  Just something to distract him.  You know, like all of America gets distracted  whenever a cute white girl dies.  We regret to report that not all the children on board the school bus survived.  We have identified the body of one victim, nine-year-old Becky Gunderson.  - No, wait, that's, Becky Gutierrez. - That's not news.  - Brian, did you see Revenge of the Sith? - Yeah, I saw part of it.  Why does Emperor Palpatine have a desk?  You know that scene where Yoda comes in  and they are about to have that big fight?  Emperor Palpatine clearly gets up from his desk.  I mean, I'm just saying, what does he need a desk for?  Who the hell cares?  I'm just saying, it's weird. I mean, what was he doing at his desk?  Like, right before Yoda walked in.  What was he doing? Was he doing paperwork?  Was he, like, ""Oh, Yoda. What do you need,  ""and will it take longer than five minutes? I'm absolutely swamped.  ""These requisition forms for new TIE fighters  ""have to be down to Debbie in accounting by 6:00,  ""or Nute Gunray is gonna pitch a tent in my waiting room. ""  Brian, what are you doing?  Gymboree is that way. Brian, it's parachute day!  I just want to swing by the army recruiting center  and give a piece of my mind to that jerk who tried to brainwash Chris.  We are gonna be so late. I'm not gonna have a partner.  I'm gonna have to be partners with the teacher.  It's just wrong for the military to mess with kids' minds.  They're all gonna wind up in therapy, like Peter was.  Every time my daughter opens her mouth,  I just want to punch her in the face. She's really annoying.  - All right, let's explore that. - What the hell's wrong with you?  Your skin's, like, moving around or something.  I believe I'm having some sort of seizure.  What kind of after-school activity should I do, Dad?  Well, Chris, there's a lot of fun activities out there.  For example, I used to be a horse whisperer.  Maybe if she spent some time on the treadmill, and I was drunk.  I wouldn't, either.  I don't think any of this stuff is right for me, Dad.  Let's just face it. I suck!  Wait, wait. Hang on. Are those the right words?  ""I wanna rock and roll all night  ""and party the first Thursday of every month""?  Yeah, shouldn't it be ""party every day""?  Well, I think the question is, if we are rocking and rolling all night,  are we gonna wanna party every day?  Yeah, that's true.  How about, "" I wanna rock and roll all night, party some days,  ""and on the other days maybe just hang out and watch a movie""?  Sounds like you guys could use some fresh blood.  This is my son, Chris. You should hear his voice.  It's absolutely gorgeous.  Like Laura Dern, if she didn't look like a banana.  - He can sing? - Yeah, runs in the family. See, look.  I am Peter Griffin  I like fancy food  I like reading comic books and dressing like a dude  Yeah, rock and roll!  Did you hear that?  Guys, I think we just found our new lead singer.  Awesome! I'm gonna be a famous music star, like Muddy Waters!  Muddy? Baby? Everything all right in there?  Oh, I think I'm about to pass a kidney stone.  Boy, I can't wait to lay into that recruiter.  Yes, you'll be about as effective as the Wizard of Oz was at granting wishes.  And, Dorothy, you wanted herpes,  but little did you know, you've had herpes all along.  I didn't want herpes!  Oh.  Well, you've got it.  Yes, I'd like to see the army recruiter.  Oh, you'll have to have a seat. There's a 25-minute wait.  Twenty-five minutes? Oh, God.  All right, I better go put more money in the meter.  Peggy, would you send in the next Oh, you're already here.  Say, aren't you a little young to join the army?  No, I have that Webster disease.  - Hey, is that the M9 double-action pistol? - Sure is. Standard issue in the army.  - Where do I sign? - Right here.  Did I mention there's a $100 bonus if you sign up a buddy?  Really? Well, I think I have a surprise for somebody.  There you are.  Congratulations. You are both in the army.  - We're both What? That's ridiculous. - I'll tell you what's ridiculous. The Kaiser.  Somebody should put him on a roll.  Over, we're coming over  And we won't come back till it's over, over there  Commercial! Damn! Play me some filler, Johnnie.  Okay, they're dead, all right? We're not gonna be seeing them again.  My God, you are the sorriest bunch of rejects  I ever seen, and I've seen The Bangles in concert.  - You! Where are you from, boy? - Quahog.  They only got two things in Quahog. Steers and queers!  I don't see no horns on you. What does that make you, boy?  - Queer? - Right!  - Oh, I got it? - Yeah.  You find something funny, Private Dancer? Dancer for money, any old music will do.  Well, actually, yeah. Your last little back-and-forth there with Stewie,  that whole queer thing, that was actually pretty funny.  Oh, God!  That's gotta hurt worse than getting a birthday telegram from ZinÃ©dine Zidane.  Yes?  Yo, yo! What's up, James Woods High?  I'm Chris and this is our band, Splash Log, and we're gonna rock this place until  Until about 9:30, 'cause that's when the dance is over.  Evil monkey holds the key  Evil monkey's gonna get me  I'm hiding underneath my sheets for fear he'll point and show his teeth  Evil, evil monkey  Evil, evil monkey  Evil, evil monkey  Mayor West?  Quiet, young man. Can't you see we're having a poker game?  Now, I'll ask again.  If I order a pizza, will anyone else have some?  I might have a slice.  Well, you know, I'm gonna need more of a commitment than that, Mark.  - West Side Story, Anything Goes - West Side Story, Anything Goes  - Two of my favorite Broadway shows - Two of my favorite Broadway shows  - Miss Saigon and Cabaret - Miss Saigon and Cabaret  - Overrated, I should say - Overrated, I should say  One, two, three, four.  Mambo!  Griffin! You got four legs there! You better start using them!  I'm trying, sir.  You got five seconds to get to the head of the pack,  or this entire platoon is gonna scrub the latrines with their toothbrushes.  - Oh, come on, Brian! - Don't screw us, Griffin!  Yeah, come on, don't screw us, Brian Griffin!  Bill, how about thinking up your jeers for a change, huh?  - Four! Three! Two! - Oh, come on, Brian, get up!  Time's up! You're pathetic, Griffin! Pathetic!  Whose half-eaten dead bird is in this footlocker?  Let's say hypothetically that it does belong to someone in here.  Would admission of that allow that person to keep it?  Private Griffin, just for that, you have to listen to one track  from this Chris Gaines album.  - Don't you think that's a little extreme? - Two tracks!  It's so stupid. It's just Garth Brooks in a wig.  - Three tracks! - Come on!  - We can go all day with this! - Yeah, but  That's it! Every single track, plus the hidden bonus track!  There's a hidden bonus track? Oh, I hope it's a ballad.  Should I follow the knight into the dungeon,  or should I go back the way I came?  I'll follow the knight. Page 37, page 37.  I mean, go back the way I came. I didn't take my hand off the page.  You seen it, Lois, right? You seen my hand on the page.  Yeah, Peter, I seen it.  Oh, no, not again.  You know, I'm glad Chris found an activity he likes,  but why do they have to use our garage?  Come on, Lois, sometimes kids can be a handful.  Look at Gregory Peck's kids.  - Are we there yet? - It's crowded back here.  - Stop touching me. - Your leg is rubbing up against mine.  - Hey! Quiet down or I'm pulling over. - Stop breathing on the window.  You idiot, that's condensation. It's on the outside.  That's it! I will come back there and, so help me God,  I will hit you with my ring hand.  What the hell are you doing?  What does it look like I'm doing? I'm leaving.  You can't leave, man. That's desertion.  They'll come after you, like Peter went after that hockey coach.  Oh, no clip?  Oh, thought we had a clip. Nope. Okay. You can't leave, Brian.  - You'll get life in prison. - I'll take my chances.  Let me ask you this. When was the last time  you saw something through to the end?  - Well, I - Never, that's when! You need this, Brian.  You dropped out of college. You still haven't finished your novel.  Do you know what you lack? Discipline!  And do you know where you'll get it? Right here in the army!  Boy, you know what? You're right.  Everything I've ever done, I've crapped out on halfway through.  Well, not this time. I am going to finish what I started.  That's the spirit! You can do anything you put your mind to.  You know, it's really hard to masturbate with you guys talking.  Not for me!  Evil, evil monkey  Chris, will you knock that off for two minutes?  - We want to talk to you. - Take five, guys.  What do you buttheads want?  You've been playing with your friends long enough.  Now it's time for you to come inside and do your homework.  - It's time for you to piss off, redhead. - What?  Hey, hey, Chris, don't talk to your mother that way.  Oh, way to stand up for your woman there, fatty.  Chris, what the hell is going on with you lately?  Ever since you hooked up with this band,  you're like a completely different person, and I don't like it one bit.  I am expressing myself! Now, get out of my way!  I'm going to the park to loiter.  - What the hell is his problem? - I don't know.  He's acting worse than you did when you tried to cover your farts by coughing.  Okay, welcome to the PTA meeting.  On the subject of school lunches,  I know there's been some concern about nutrition.  We've had complaints about the soda machines,  And I have spoken with the school board.  Is there something you'd like to say, Mr. Griffin?  No.  No. No, I'm good.  All right, men.  This obstacle course represents the final test of your training.  Almost all of you have completed it in the allotted time.  But as you know, as a unit, you either all graduate,  or none of you graduate.  Griffin, it's up to you.  All right, you can do this, Brian. Come on, pray with me.  Dear Lord, just stay out of our way. Okay, good luck.  And go!  There's Waldo.  - Fresh pepper? - Yes, thank you.  - Oh, that's plenty, thanks. - None for me, thanks.  My boyfriend just dumped me.  There's a lot of fish in the sea. It's always darkest before the dawn.  If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.  Thanks!  You did it, Brian! You did it!  Oh, I say, this is an even bigger accomplishment  than getting Minnie Driver's head to fit onscreen.  Okay, back up.  - Further. Move back some more. What?  - Back up some more. - I'm as far away as I can get.  Okay, have her enter. Action!  Damn it. Cut!  Congratulations, men. You've all passed basic training.  I'm proud to call you soldiers.  I'm sure you'll do your country proud tomorrow morning,  when you're all shipped off to Iraq.  - What? - Oh, don't worry.  I'm sure he means Fraggle Iraq.  This isn't so bad.  Yes, the people are friendly.  I say the media has totally blown this whole thing out of proportion.  Okay, I go in store. I throw backpack. Big boom.  No, no, no. You are big boom. Big hero.  Okay, right. So I throw backpack,  come back and have big hero party with many virgins.  - No, no, no, no, no. You boom! - Okay, okay. I put on backpack, boom.  Then I come back, be hero, virgins.  Okay, yeah, see you in a few minutes, big hero.  Unit 17, this is base. Please report.  - 10-four, everything is Charlie 4060. - What does that mean?  I don't know. I just thought you're supposed to say names and numbers.  Nobody's corrected me so far.  What the hell was that?  Help, help! I mean Charlie, Tango, Cash,  47 Victor Charlie, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!  Roger that. We're moving to your position.  Chris, your father and I are very upset by this new attitude of yours.  - I don't care what you think of me! - Oh, God. I envy that.  I am so self-conscious about what people think of me.  I am out of here.  You know, I think I may have an idea what's causing his behavior, Peter.  Look at all this stuff.  Listen to these lyrics. ""I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches.  ""I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits. ""  Oh, look, they got a translation for white people.  ""I give 110% when it comes to helping my community,  ""even though I occasionally associate  ""with some less-than-reputable characters. ""  Peter, these lyrics are filthy.  All this violent music is what's screwing Chris up.  What the hell? Marilyn Manson?  - Is that who's causing all this? - Yeah, it's all him or her's fault.  Who does he or she think he or she is?  Look, you can totally see his or her nipples.  That's obscene, maybe.  - There's only one thing to do. - You're right.  We've gotta find this Marilyn Manson  and I gotta give that bastard or bitch a piece of my mind or penis.  All right, it shouldn't be too hard to get ourselves kicked out.  Right, we've just gotta convince them we're not army material.  - Ready? - All right, let's do it.  Wow, look at how gay we are. I am so gay with my gayness.  Me too. I'm I'm a homo.  - Any room for one more? - Hell, yeah!  All right, last resort. We get injured and go home with Purple Hearts.  - Shoot me in the foot. - What? Shoot yourself in the foot.  No, no, no, no. They can tell by the angle. Here, you shoot me and I'll shoot you.  - I don't think this is gonna work. - Of course it will work.  Ready? One, two, three.  Damn it! Oh, my God, that hurts!  - I think you missed me. - All right, I'll try again.  No, no, no. Hang on, that looks like it's painful.  Of course it's painful. There's a bullet in my foot.  - Now, get over here. - No, no, no, no, no.  I've changed my mind. I don't wanna do it.  - Come on, we had a deal. - No, no, no. Don't point that at me.  Okay, come on. This is not helping, for God's sake.  Oh, you got me.  - Let me see it. - No, no. It's gross.  - Let me see it. - No. No, I don't want to gross you out.  We are in so much pain, right now. The two of us.  Okay, that was real!  Hey, hi. I'm Private Stewie and this is Private Brian.  We both got shot in the foot,  so we figured an honorable discharge would be in order.  And you could just send us back to the States.  Getting shot doesn't get you out of here anymore.  - What? - Yeah, we take whatever we can get.  I mean, we got two dead guys guarding the ammunition.  Sorry guys, you are here until the job is done.  Great news, everybody. Democracy just kicked in.  So, it's over? That seems unlikely.  Amazing.  There was only one man in the world with the vision to predict something like this.  Damn!  Laura! Laura! Laura!  And the Grammy for biggest posse goes to Ja Rule.  - What? - No, Madonna. Posse. Posse.  Oh.  All right, Marilyn Manson has to be here somewhere.  Good thing we distracted that guard with that riddle.  What gets wetter as it dries?  A towel. Hey, I've been had!  Hey, look. Right over there.  Hey, Manson.  - What in the world was that for? - Oh, it's a guy.  That's for ruining our son.  He used to be a sweet boy until he heard your music.  This old story. If I had a nickel. All right. Where's your son?  I'm hiding underneath my sheets for fear he'll point and show his teeth  Chris, we brought someone you might like to meet.  Oh, my God! Marilyn Manson.  Hey there, Chris. You working hard or hardly working?  - So, I see you're in a band. - Yep!  Listen, your parents tell me you've been acting out a little bit,  and I just wanted to tell you rock and roll music is cool,  but respect for your elders is a tune we can all dance to.  - Really? - Sure.  And the best way to start a fun-filled day of being a good citizen  is with a healthy breakfast, rich in breads and grains.  And fruits are important too.  You mean like apples, oranges and bananas?  Any of them, Chris. You can't miss.  And now I think your parents have something to say.  Chris, you don't really believe all the things in those song lyrics, do you?  No.  Then why you been acting like such a punk?  - I guess I don't really know. - I think I have an idea.  Peter, when was the last time you and Chris here did something together?  - Boy, I guess it's been a while. - Here's something you might not know.  Children crave structure.  They enjoy the fun of planned activities in which they and their parent or guardian  can share a common goal. Maybe you could take Chris fishing.  What do you say, Chris? You wanna go fishing with your old man?  - Do I? - Can't go without these."

Tim Daly, he was on Wings. What, nobody here watched Wings?  Is that the one where there is a guy and he's like He's a pilot or something?  No, it's two guys, they are brothers, and they are both pilots.  Hey, wasn't there a fat guy with a mustache?  That was Roy, he's hilarious.  Was this a cartoon?  No Oh, my God! No! No! It took place in an airport!  The thing was on for 10 years!  And the funny repair guy was Lowell. It made Tony Shalhoub's career!  - Who? - The tennis player?  You know what, screw you guys. I don't even know you.  Crazy people, living under a rock, don't know Wings.  I love Wings.  All right, I want to be very clear about this.  You can meet her, chat for a minute, and that's it. In and out.  Don't worry, Brian, if she is as ugly as I think she is,  I'll look at her once, and then I'll go  All over the place.  Then you'll wipe it up, and then we will go.  Hi, Brian. Oh, my God! Who is your cute little friend?  Oh, my! Hello. Stewie. Charmed.  I'm Jillian, come on in. Who wants a drink?  So, are you gonna take back what you said?  - Brian, she's stunning. - Okay, you met her. You can scram now.  I shall do no such thing.  Now, why in the world would you be embarrassed about dating her?  Oh, my God, Brian.  I was watching something on TV about this guy named Hitler.  Somebody should stop him.  - Is she retarded? - Can you please leave now?  Oh, now I get it, she's a moron.  But a moron with large breasts  you can use as mountains for your Matchbox cars  or whatever it is grown-ups do with large breasts.  Shut up, that's not it at all.  Say, Jillian, I love what you have done with the place.  What is it? One bedroom, one bath?  - No, it's a whole apartment. - Oh, God, outstanding!  So, Stewie, do you work with Brian at the detective agency?  Why, yes, as a matter of fact I do. At the detective agency.  That's got to be a tough job.  I know Brian's work has him coming and going at all hours of the night.  - I bet it does. I bet it does. - Okay, well, Stewie has to go now.  What are you talking about?  I want some more of Jillian's delicious lemonade.  I know. It's good, right?  I just wish they didn't have to kill so many lemons to make it.  Oh, this is fun, huh?  So, wait, Dupree moves in with Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon?  But they're newlyweds, right?  Well, that's no time to have a house guest. Got to go.  Sorry, Angela,  every Tuesday morning I call my friend Cleveland,  and he describes every scene from You, Me and Dupree.  Griffin, your work output this week is even worse than usual.  Where the hell are those purchase orders?  Yeah, it's this bum hand. I can't type with it.  Well, that's not my problem.  I need to see some improvement by the end of the week,  - or you're finished. - Don't worry, I'll figure something out.  Oh, that's going to be Quagmire with Along Came Polly.  I got to take that.  All right, so as you know, by this point in the story,  Ben Stiller doesn't like spicy food.  - Well, guess what's for dinner! - No way.  Boy, Lois, thanks so much for coming in and helping me get my work done.  Without you, Angela would have been all over my case.  Oh, it's all right, Peter,  I know it's tough for you to work with your hand injury.  Hey, you know, with you sitting there, it's kind of like you're my secretary.  Well, let's not get carried away, Peter. Now please, I'm trying to finish your work.  You know, Lois, if I'm your boss, I got to look like a boss.  Finally, I have a reason to wear this big bow tie and cigar I bought  at the Dress For Success store.  - Peter, if you want this work to get done - Lois, take a letter.  Dear Life Cereal,  where do you get off?  ""Part of a balanced breakfast and delicious""?  Who do you think you are?  By now, you may have guessed I'm speaking ironically  and have nothing but good things to say about what you do.  Life Cereal, do not change a thing.  Signed, Peter Griffin, dictated but not read.  Lois, read that back to me.  Oh, hey, Brian, back from a hot booty call with your idiot girlfriend.  You know, think what you want,  but you don't see the side of Jillian that I do.  Face it, Brian, she is dumber than a Boston-area book report.  The novel I chose to address is Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens.  Queer name, right? The book was actually not bad.  For your information, Jillian is very bright,  and she happens to be a very talented photographer.  Oh, that is so lame.  Every hot girl who can aim a camera thinks she is a photographer.  You took a black and white picture of a lawn chair and its shadow  and developed it at Savon, you must be so brooding and deep.  Knock it off.  No, I want to know, Brian, what specifically do you talk about?  A lot of things. Food,  the new seat covers she just got for her Jetta.  - Real World/Road Rules Challenge. - You hate MTV.  Pot helps.  Look, you know, I don't have to justify anything to you, all right?  All that matters, is Jillian and I have a great time together,  we make each other laugh.  Fine, but just tell me this, Brian,  does she laugh on her own or does she laugh only when you laugh?  I thought so.  Hey, yeah.  You got to hit DVD and then menu and then select.  Yeah. Yeah, the DVD needs to be face up when you put it in.  You should be able to see the words Mr. 3000 Yeah.  Still nothing? Is it plugged in? Okay, so plug it in.  Okay, you got it? Okay, all right. No problem, all right.  All right. Love you, too, Jilly bean. Okay.  - What? - Nothing, I didn't say anything.  I need a drink.  Hey, Jilly bean. Hey, it's Brian again.  So, yeah. So I figured we could get together tonight  and maybe do all those things sexually that we usually do.  What were those again?  No way, gross. I mean No. Yeah, I totally love how that feels.  Hi.  You know, I've been noticing you around the steno pool.  You look good enough for a promotion.  - Peter, cut it out. - Hey, that's no way to talk to your boss.  - Is that Pert? - You know it is.  Smell my Speed Stick.  - Peter, what the hell are you doing? - Lois, I'm going to come right out with it.  I think it would be so hot for you and me to have sex in my office.  Oh, my God! There is no way that is going to happen.  You know, it's no wonder you are so far behind in your work  if this is the way you behave at the office.  Come on, just touch it. Touch yours.  Peter, no. I have work to do so you can keep your job.  Oh, look at me, I'm Lois, I'm a worker, I make stuff on things.  Oh, I'll file these later. Oh, I got a phone. Nope, that's it.  Jeez, Lois, I thought having you here was going to be fun,  but so far you are a bigger buzz kill than Buzz Killington.  Oh, man, this is the best party I have ever been to.  Evening, everyone.  I thought it would be very droll if we all sat down and looked at etchings.  - Would you like to join me, Peter? - Well, we are kind of partying here.  Good, hold this up.  Now, here is a fellow attempting to ride a bicycle,  but he is having some trouble, isn't he?  - Would you like to know why? - Why?  Because he is a Scot.  Now, who here likes a good story about a bridge?  What the hell? Jillian, what are you doing here?  Oh! Hi, Brian. It was so nice of you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner.  I invited her for dinner?  Yes, you did. You wanted her to meet the family.  Now, come here, Brian. Come sit by your friend Stewie.  And then think about this,  have you ever seen the sun and the moon in the same place at the same time?  - They're the same person. - I know, right?  - You're brilliant. - Hey, Oogy!  So tell us, Oogy, where did you find this one, huh?  You two meet at a Mensa meeting?  No, at a Quiznos.  We both ordered the Turkey Ranch and Swiss, no onions.  Can you believe that?  No. Wow! What are the odds?  Well, hey, what are the odds of finding true love anywhere in the world,  says this observer.  Hey, you want to know something cool?  I threw up a lot in high school, so I don't get my period anymore.  Wow, this is the one you have been waiting for, huh, Brian?  Are you serious? Are you serious, Brian?  You know what, Lois, don't judge,  because you don't know what two people are like when they are alone.  Come on, let's go out dancing.  I don't know. I'm feeling kind of cozy tonight, kind of mellow.  I just really want to go dance.  There it is again, what is that?  So, Jillian, what are your views regarding Homeland Security?  Do you think we should support what the President is doing?  Well, I just think, for starters,  that sometimes the government has things they can't tell us.  And truthishly, we should just accept that.  Okay, good night, everyone.  Oh, say, Jillian, before you go,  I forget, do you know what the capital of this state is?  Rhode Island City?  It's like she's fucking five.  Thanks for hanging out with my friends, Brian.  Hey, come on, we're a legitimate couple, right?  So, then the valet pulls up, and I'm all, ""That is so not my car,""  but then it totally was.  - That's happened to me. - Me, too.  Cars go fast.  Oh, God, yeah,  I'll tell you, if I had a nickel for every time that happened.  - Yeah? - What?  What if you had a nickel for every time that happened?  - No, nothing, it's just an expression. - A what?  Well, I was just saying, I do my share of dopey stuff, like  Oh, this  This one time I attended a speaker's colloquium  on federal judgeships,  and without realizing it, I kept calling William Rehnquist ""William Rinequist. ""  God! I mean  Anyone else have to go to the little girl's room?  I have new gloss.  - I love gloss. - Gloss rhymes with hair.  Dude, that was painful. - What are you doing here?  Did you follow us?  Brian, why can't you just admit what's going on here?  Okay, okay, fine, fine. I'm gonna have to break it off.  But, boy, it's going to be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin.  ""Lincoln assassinated Tragedy for our republic ""  Oh, look, "" Ably performed by the entire ensemble. ""  - That's us. - That's all of us.  Morning, Lois, I need you to proofread this and collate it for me.  Peter, did you Xerox your penis?  Three-hundred times. It's a flip book. Flip through it or you're fired.  Oh, my God! This is disgusting.  Peter, for the last time, I'm not having sex with you in this office.  Why the hell are you pushing this so hard?  Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter to Penthouse Forum,  and I don't want to be made a liar in the nudie magazine of reckon.  All right,  if I give you 30 seconds of making out, will that shut you up?  Let's see where it goes.  Oh, God! You know this is pretty hot. Yeah, what did I tell you, huh?  Oh, God, Peter, let's do it. Let's do it right here, right now.  Lois. Lois, wait. Wait! Opie's right there.  I want him to look, Peter.  Well, that is the last of it. You are now all caught up with your work.  Lois, I really appreciate you helping me out this week,  and I really appreciate you having sex with me in my office.  Well, that was my pleasure, too, Peter.  Hey, I knew I would get you, just like Danny DeVito got Rhea Perlman.  - I don't know, Danny. - Look, it's either me or nobody.  Sold.  All right, Brian, you can do this. You can dump her.  Because once it's done,  never again will you have to listen to her talk like this?  You know, where everything has a question mark at the end of it?  With an upward inflection at the end of every sentence?  Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking? Oh, damn it. Now I'm doing it, too.  Oh, hey, Oogy! Oh, you look tense.  Well, Jillian, there is something we need to talk about.  What is it?  I just wanted to spend some time with you.  What the hell? It took you three hours to break up with her?  - Not exactly. - Well, what were you doing in there?  What's that smell? Smells like sweat and anger and shame.  Yup.  Life is confusing when you grow up, isn't it, Brian?  - It is. - Can we play my mix tape?  Yeah, go ahead.  Brian had sex with a really dumb girl  Now he's taking his friend Stewie to get some ice cream  In his car  Oh, you're a poor sport."

                    			We now return to Rodney King of Queens.  - Rodney, did you take out the trash? - Um, I forgot.  Oh, no she di-in't.  Pizza for Adam West.  No. You gave me Canadian bacon instead of bacon?  This misdeed cannot go unpunished.  Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your maker at the hands of my cat launcher.  Hey, look, somebody tried to break into the dirty movie store.  Quick, grab as many as you can before someone sees us.  Damn, I lost him.  All right, cats, back in the bag. Come on, Fluffy.  Come on, Mittens. Come on, Paul.  What a ridiculous name for a cat.  Paul! That's a person's name.  A person's name.  Oh, Paul.  Oh, man, this is going to be great.  - Oh, are we watching a movie? - The lab results are back.  You've tested positive for nymphomania.  Oh, no, what should I do?  Take two of these and call us in the morning.  Oh, now that's not going to help her nymphomania.  It's only going to exacerbate it.  Oh, my God, what are you kids doing? Out. Everybody out.  That's bogus.  - Chris, what is this? - Genital Hospital.  Yes, and it's inappropriate for someone your age.  Now, if you're curious about sex, you should talk to your sex ed teacher.  We don't have one. The principal cut sex ed class to save money.  What? Well, that's crazy.  Without sex ed, kids can wind up sexually confused.  Just look at Michael Jackson.  The kid in me likes the frosted side  but the grown-up in me likes the kid in me.  Peter, do you know they're not teaching sex ed at Chris' school?  Eh, let them figure it out the way I had to.  With a can of Crisco and a shot glass. That's the natural way, Lois.  That's the natural way.  Well, somebody's got to step in.  Tomorrow, I'm going down to James Woods High  and offer to teach the class myself.  Hey, you could really make a difference.  Like I did when I taught money management to those drug addicts.  There's a lot of ways for you guys to save money.  For example, you're all shooting up, why not share needles?  That's a no-brainer. More money in your wallet, more drugs in your veins.  My second piece of advice: have as many kids as you can,  'cause that makes it more likely that one of those kids'll grow up  and make it big in Hollywood.  Then who's paying the bills, eh?  Hollywood kid.  Class dismissed.  Good morning, everyone.  I'm Mrs. Griffin, your new sex ed teacher.  Now, you've probably heard all those rumors  that condoms make sex less pleasurable.  While that is a fact, they also make sex safer.  Sorry I'm late, Lois.  Peter, what are you doing here?  Lois, you think I'm going to miss a chance to share  my knowledge with these fresh young minds?  Forget it, I've missed too many other opportunities.  - There he is. - Took you long enough.  - Just what we need. - Hey, guys, I'm coming in.  - Oh, God. - Oh, God.  Oh, boy. I am not going to hear the end of this.  - You jackass. - Now you've done it.  Idiot.  I know I don't fit here, but I'm just going to settle right in.  All right, Peter, you can stay, but remember, this is my class.  Now, there are a number of natural ways that males and females interact.  That's right, allow me to demonstrate.  Hey, Rainbow Brite. Hello, Shakespeare.  I am all done writing plays for the day,  perhaps we could have sexual intercourse?  Count me in.  I say, look at this. This toy has small parts.  Why the devil would they include small parts?  Unless  I'm supposed to eat them. Of course, it all adds up!  Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth.  Dude, you're lucky.  If you put that under your pillow,  the Tooth Fairy will come and give you a dollar.  What? Did you say the Tooth Fairy comes here?  To our house? She just breaks in like some hood?  Yeah, she creeps into your house at night and comes into your room while you sleep.  Oh, my God!  And sometimes, just for the hell of it,  she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair  and places it gently on your tongue.  Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here!  Stewie, calm down. Get a hold of yourself.  Here, Brian, let me handle this.  Calm down. Everything's going to be all right.  Chris, you're wanted on the phone.  Everything's going to be all right.  Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly  for the class today, but they were all out so I got Smucker's.  Peter, I don't know what you think you're doing,  but you ruined my sex ed class. There's no way you're coming with me again.  Fine,  but without my advice, those kids are going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson  when he tries to play an American cowboy.  But, Montana, when will you be back?  That's none of your concern. You got to take care of the offspring.  Gonna take a fortnight at least to get this herd down to St. Louis on Mississippi.  This glen's gonna be tough to traverse,  and that river's got to be 50, 60 meters wide.  And God knows how many fathoms.  To hell with parliamentary procedure. We've got to wrangle up some cattles.  What is going on here?  We're all protesting the sex ed class that's being taught to our children.  Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have to tell you this,  but the school board has voted to cancel your sex ed class.  Look, Principal Shepherd, I know my husband acted inappropriately  Oh, it's not because of your husband.  It's because you're teaching those kids about condoms.  What? That's ridiculous.  These students have the right to information about safe sex.  Well, these parents don't think so.  I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin. You're fired.  Fired?! Oh, no.  I can't believe they fired you.  Can't you go down the school and try to reason with them?  No, I'm banned from school property.  The PTA doesn't want me around their children.  Well, Lois, I think you did the right thing  by trying to inform these kids about safe sex.  And if the parents don't like it, that's their loss.  That's the problem, though. It isn't their loss, it's the kids' loss.  I just hope they're getting the information they need.  All right, students, we have a special speaker today  who's going to educate you about sex.  Please welcome from the First Evangelical Church,  the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood and the Opal Ring Crusade.  Hey, kids, put your Walkmans down and listen up.  'Cause we're going to talk about sex.  Sex? Hang on there, Jerry.  God, what are you doing here?  I was just passing through on my way to see The Matrix.  - We can relate to that. - No fake.  Well, God, I am here to talk to these kids about sex.  Uh-oh.  And why they shouldn't be having it.  That is boss.  Hey, you kids like Mad TV?  Well, we've got something almost as good.  Here they are The Opal Ring Players.  Boy, I sure had fun at the pizza parlor tonight, Debbie.  Yeah, Matthew, that pizza pie was delicious.  Hey, watch out, crazy driver.  That joker must have been from Jefferson High.  They're our rivals.  Well, here we are at the make-out point.  Yeah. You want to go all the way?  Freeze! Now, who can tell me what Matthew just did wrong?  I mean, besides not running over that yahoo from Jefferson High.  They're our rivals.  He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex and he's not married.  - Bingo. - Wow, you're pretty smart.  - Thanks. My name's Doug. - I'm Meg.  Now, look, let's rap for a second.  He's sitting informally like us. Let's hear what he has to say.  Jefferson High is our rival.  Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it before you're married,  even if you use a condom.  Because not only to condoms fail 100% of the time,  they're also majorly unsafe.  Hey, you wouldn't put a plastic bag over your grandmother's head, would you?  No.  And that's why we're gonna be handing out these opal rings.  These rings are a symbol of your commitment  to refrain from sex until you're married.  So what do you say? Who wants to be joyful?  Who wants to be pure? Who wants to be abstinent?  - Wow, he makes so much sense. - I know, he's a visionary,  like Gandhi or Mozart or Picasso.  Ladies and gentlemen, my newest work.  Now, I know this person looks a little mixed up,  but, watch carefully. If I move this down here,  and this over here,  and this part here  Anyone tell who it is yet? No?  Okay, well, what if I move this here and this here  Then it's Dianne Wiest.  All right, men, your mission tonight is to stave off  the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy.  SpongeBob, you watch the East.  StarScream, you take the West.  And Man-E-Faces, you take center patrol since you have many faces.  Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's morning.  Is it?  Ha! I knew it! I scared her off.  Uh, you might want to check under your pillow.  How did she get in?  She must have been quieter than Britney Spears' dietician.  Ea-Easy on those trans fats.  N- Not everything needs gravy.  You know, there's some carrots down at the other end.  That-that cheesecake was for everyone.  Her hand was right beneath my pillow.  She could have snapped my neck if she had a mind to.  Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be a while before you lose another tooth.  I can't wait for that.  I have to lure her back on my terms and kill her myself!  But to catch a fairy, I have to think like a fairy.  If you want Brian to say: ""Well, that'll be a stretch,""  text-message FAMGUY1.  If you want Brian to say: ""I'm not touching that one,""  text FAMGUY2.  If you want Brian to say: ""Arriba!"" and dance around a sombrero,  text FAMGUY3.  Enter now.  Thanks for voting.  Arriba!  We now return to Laguna Beach.  - Like, right? - I know.  - Whatever, because ""duh!"" - I know, right?  Whatever, because I mean, like, totally full out.  - Full on. - Right?  I guess it's not easy growing up anywhere.  Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring. It means I made a pledge not to have sex.  That's crazy! You can't give up sex. You've got a responsibility.  You see, Meg, you're what they call a ""practice girl. ""  Dad, look at the facts about sex.  ""If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another dimension""  ""populated entirely by dogs who will eat it. ""  Well, that's something I'd like to avoid. Well, this changes everything.  From now on, I, too, will be obstinate.  - Abstinent. - Absinthe.  - Abstinent. - You're grounded.  All right, getting a tooth to lure  that damn fairy back shouldn't be too difficult.  I'd love to dance, Fred Savage.  Gosh, Meg, I really wish we could take our relationship to the next level.  I know, I feel the same way, but we made a decision to be abstinent.  Of course, there are ways we could keep our pledge  and still do other things.  You're right. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Uh-huh.  Oh, there it is. I see it.  You know, Roy, I hope you play squash better than you pass.  Well, we'll find out this Saturday.  All right, Peter, you ready for role-playing night?  Here comes, Grimace. You got some burgers I can steal, huh?  Lois, the Hamburglar steals hamburgers.  Grimace is Ronald McDonald's autistic friend.  Oh, come on, you love the dirty-talking Grimace.  You Peter, what the hell is this?  - My chastity belt. - A chastity belt?  - What in God's name is that for? - I'm abstinent, Lois.  It's all in these pamphlets Meg brought home from school.  Sex turns straight people gay and turn gays into Mexicans.  Everyone goes down a notch.  This is nonsense. You can't force abstinence on kids.  Lois, what possible harm can abstinence do?  Meg Griffin, we need to have a talk.  Mom!  Oh, my God!  You kids were doing it  in the ear!  Hey, my sandwich tastes funny. Is there something wrong with the Smucker's?  Yeah, it's been on my crotch.  Meg, I still cannot believe what you and Doug did last night.  Mom, you don't understand. Doug and I are abstinent,  but if we have sex in the ear, it doesn't count.  We're still pure in the eyes of the Lord.  Meg, when I was your age, my parents tried to feed me  the same nonsense about premarital sex. You're lying to yourself.  Well, I don't care what you think!  Doug and I are part of the Opal Ring Crusade,  and this is how we choose to express our love.  Look, Meg, A) ear sex is just unnatural,  and B) How do I say this?  Vaginal intercourse is  it's just tops.  It's the bee's knees, Meg.  Oh, when you rattle it around just right  oh, my God!  I mean, you remember when we had that old car with the bad shocks  and I used to take the old dirt road on purpose?  Meg Meg?  I love you.  In local news, a sexy new trend has emerged at James Woods High.  That's right, Tom. It appears that students have taken to having ear sex  in lieu of traditional intercourse.  Over 200 reports of ear sex have been confirmed so far,  prompting a new slogan: ""Once you go black,""  ""you go deaf. ""  Brian, I'll be right back. I'm going to use the little girl's room.  All right, baby.  An entire week and still no teeth.  And it turns out these teeth I got from the old man are phony.  Brian, Brian, look, I'm Gary Busey.  I'm frequently aggressive in situations that don't call for it.  - What the hell is that? - Ah, it's Jillian. She's, uh  she has this eating disorder. She's bulimic.  - My God, that's horrible! - I know, it really is.  I mean, her hair is falling out. Last week she lost a tooth.  Really?  But man, I'll tell ya, all that purging just makes her body look fantastic.  I mean, that's what the supermodels do.  And so many of them just look so great.  Karen Carpenter over did it,  but I think Jillian's found a good balance.  I'm really surprised you invited me out for dinner, Stevie.  Oh, well, you know, I just wanted to touch base, see how everything's  It's ""Stewie,"" by the way.  Just to check in, make sure everything's going well with you and Brian.  It's going kickass!  Well, you look fantastic.  Got some meat on your bones, which is great.  - What? - Just saying you look jolly,  like Ruben Studdard or John Goodman or Santa.  Oh, my God. Are you saying I'm fat?  No, I'm saying Santa's thin. Get in there and throw up!  Excellent. Now I'm prepared to fight the Tooth Fairy  just like Gerri fought comedy on The Facts of Life.  Hey, Blair, did you find a purse at the mall?  Actually, I found seven.  One for every day of the week.  I'm wide awake, Peter.  - You want to mess around? - Lois, you know I'm abstinent.  Come on. Can't you break your stupid pledge for one night?  Well, I guess we do both have needs.  Peter.  Wh-What are you doing? What? Peter, what are you doing to my ear?!  Get off of me!  What the hell is wrong with you?!  This is all I can do, Lois. I'm abstinent.  That is it.  I am going to have regular sex with you whether you like it or not.  No!  I wasn't asking your permission.  No, no, no! I'm abstinent!  This is an affront to the Lord!  No!  No!  Oh, I see what you're driving at.  Oh, that was fantastic.  Hey, when'd you get that tattoo on your lower back?  I don't know, Peter. Meth is a hell of a drug.  What?  I'm just glad to have you back on my side.  I only wish I could convince Meg and her classmates, too.  We'll show 'em somehow, Lois.  I'll be more convincing than Mel Gibson when he apologized to the Jews.  I'm really, really sorry about your big noses.  I'm really sorry about how greedy you are.  But most of all, I'm really sorry about your dirty,  underhanded, backstabbing ways.  Your number-one dirty Jew fan, Mel Gibson.  All right, Tooth Whore, do your worst.  Stewie, what the hell? Get me down from here.  No, way, man! How do I know you're not the Tooth Fairy in disguise?  - Your middle name is Gilligan. - Not good enough!  - You think my girlfriend's a moron. - So does everyone!  You have a picture of Chris Noth in your wallet.  Okay.  Stewie, this is ridiculous. There's something I have to tell you.  The Tooth Fairy isn't real.  What?!  Look, I didn't want to burst your bubble since you're just a kid, but,  yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors  just like Harry Houdini.  But I don't want to play bridge with the Petersons tonight.  Harry, we agreed weeks ago, and we're going.  All right, fine, let me get my coat.  Oh, wait a second!  Damn it! I am not going by myself!  Ah, you bitch.  Oh, very well then.  I suppose that bile-spewing skirt of yours can have her tooth back.  What? It's gone!  Whoa, I wonder what happened to it?  Peter, how are we going to get past the guard?  Lois, I think I just got an idea.  You see that guy with the overcoat?  He's tall enough for us to sneakin behind him. Come on!  So remember, sex is bad, immoral, and wrong.  And if you have sex, you're automatically in Al Qaeda.  Kids, do not listen to this man.  He is wrong, he is feeding you lies.  Now, look, it's true. You shouldn't have sex until you're ready.  You should wait until you're in love.  But I mean, hey, we're all human, huh?  We have urges, and they are perfectly natural.  And if you do make the choice to act on them,  make sure you protect yourselves,  use a condom.  - I'm going to use condoms. - Me, too!  Maybe I'll use two condoms at the same time.  - Why would you do that? - Oh, I mean, just one, just one.  Doug, my mom's right.  If we really care about each other, it's okay to have sex.  We'll be safe. We'll use a condom,  and it'll be wonderful.  Wow! Does this mean I'll see you naked?  - Yeah. - Oh, boy, I can't wait.  - I'm sorry Doug dumped you, honey. - It's all your fault!  - I'm proud of you, sweetheart. - Me, too, Lois.  You stood up for what you believe in.  I just wish I could have been there to hear the speech you made.  You think you could give me a little taste?  If you want to hear Lois' speech, text-message FAMGUY1.  If you want to hear Meg talk about her day, text FAMGUY2.  If you want to give Cleveland his first line of the episode, text FAMGUY3.  Enter now.  Thanks for voting.  Hey, y'all, sock it to me!"

                    			It seems today that all you see  Is violence in movies and sex on TV  But where are those good old-fashioned values  On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do  All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a family guy  Coming up, a New Orleans man says his socks are finally dry.  But first, the big news in entertainment this week  is the lovable child actress, Olivia Fuller.  Oh, my God, Brian, that's Olivia from the performing arts school.  What sort of overblown contract has that dreadful bitch landed now?  Most of you know Olivia as the adorable little girl in the Tasty Juice ads.  - Hey, Mom, can I have some soda? - No, but you can have some Tasty Juice.  - It has only one-third the sugar of soda. - Delicious. Thanks, Mom.  But little Olivia's career may be over just as it begins  with today's announcement that Tasty Juice will be dropping her  as their spokesperson and replacing her with a new ad campaign  featuring rock and roll legend Chuck Berry.  Open your mouth, baby, here it comes.  But there is a silver lining for local Quahogians,  as Miss Fuller will be appearing at the Quahog Mall this weekend  to mark the grand opening of the new Brat Wraps kids clothing store.  Oh, that's perfect.  Brian, we have to go down there this weekend and heckle her roundly.  I'll humiliate her worse than Luke Skywalker did to that rebel pilot.  The exhaust shaft is only two meters wide,  so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.  Well, that's impossible, even for a computer.  It's not impossible. I used to bullseye womp rats in my T-16 back home.  They're not much bigger than two meters.  Hey, can I talk to you privately for a second?  Sure.  That was unnecessary.  - What's the problem? - Well, you just kind of called me out  - in front of everybody back there. - I was just making a point.  I know, but you like just kind of sandbagged me  in front of everyone we know.  - Oh, I ""sandbagged"" you? - In front of all of our friends.  - Yeah, you sandbagged me. - I ""sandbagged"" you?  You sandbagged me, yes.  Well, here I am trying to help you with something  You know what, I don't need your kind of help, all right?  Have a great assault. Jerk.  Lois, I don't understand why I got to sit through a chick flick.  Peter, you promised you'd come with me to see Autumn's Piano.  Besides, you owe me big after the way you embarrassed me  in front of Sandra Oh.  Oh, my God. Sandra Oh. We loved you in Sideways.  Thank you.  We see you in many movies.  I think about you while having sex with my wife.  I thank you with $1.  That's a lot of money to them.  Lois, I'm just warning you, if this movie turns me gay,  I'm gonna start bringing gay guys home.  And I don't mean the classy,  ""Maybe they are, maybe they're not"" gay guys.  I mean those big,  ""Oh, my God, here they come, floating around, making noise"" gay guys,  not the ""fix up your house"" gay guys.  Peter, it's starting.  You must be Autumn Daniels.  Welcome to Barncliffe school for girls.  We're your roommates.  I'm Sassy, that's Pouty, and this is Suicidy.  I got a bad feeling about Suicidy.  Ain't no mountain high enough  Yeah!  You can tell all the girls care about each other,  'cause they have so much fun cleaning the dishes.  I have to leave, and I'm taking my piano with me.  No!  Why? Why?  She chose the piano over her insulin.  You could've had both!  See? That wasn't so bad.  Oh, you know, Lois, this movie has helped me understand a lot of things.  Like that foreign guy at work who helped me understand sarcasm.  Nice day we're having.  - Yes! - What?  He say ""nice day,"" but he covered with rain.  So?  So, he say this when your brain know is not really nice day.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  - Yes. He say the opposite. Is funny. - Oh, yeah, I get it.  ""Nice day. ""  Now you funny, too.  There she is, Brian.  Oh, boy, I am going to take her down right in front of everybody.  All right, Olivia, get ready to  - Good lord. - What is it?  Brian, she looks  She looks fantastic.  And now TV's Olivia Fuller will cut the ceremonial ribbon.  I hope I'm allowed to do this.  My mommy says, ""Don't run with scissors. ""  She's so cute. I love children.  Look at my kids.  So everyone feel free to browse and purchase from our fine selection.  Hey, Mom, now would be a good time to raise my allowance.  Oh, this one's kind of nice. What Olivia!  - Hey! - Stewie? Oh, my God.  - Wow, this is It's been a while. - Yeah, I know, it has.  So, you back in town?  Yeah, we're moving back into the old house.  Oh, that's God, you look great. I mean, you're all in shape.  My God, California's been good to you.  I mean, I guess you should be looking good,  'cause everybody's a health nut out there, right?  Yeah.  Well, anyway, it was nice seeing you again, so  You, too. Hey, listen, maybe you want to come over on Friday?  It's my Bernie Mac night.  It's a fun show, if you haven't seen it.  I can't understand what the devil he's saying,  but, you know, there's a lot of movement,  and it's bright and colorful. It keeps my attention.  Look, Stewie, you're sweet, but since I moved to Hollywood,  I've done a lot of growing up.  I'm dating more sophisticated men now.  But it was good to see you.  - What happened? - She shot me down, Brian.  What do you care?  You came here to gloat about her contract cancellation anyway.  Yes, but that was before I got a look at her face.  I mean, she's a woman now, Brian.  So sophisticated, so grown up, and she says she wants a grown-up man.  But, apparently, that's not me.  You think so?  Who could forget that one?  Hi, I'm the Mayor of Comedy, here to tell you about a new CD offer.  Sitcom Punch Lines of the 80's.  Including such gems as  '""I think it's time for plan 'B,""  '""Smooth move, Ex-Lax'""  and '""That went well. '""  Also, '""Check, please! '""  Plus, '""Open mouth, insert foot'""  and '""Wait, if you're here, then that means Oh boy! '""  Order now and receive  Sounds of the 80's Studio Audience,  which includes  '""Trouble Brewing'""  Ooh!  As well as  '""Sweet Moment'""  Aw!  And, of course,  '""Ethnic Kiss. '""  This is an offer you don't want to miss. But don't take my word for it.  Hear what '80s mainstay Howard Hesseman has to say about it.  I love it.  Would Howard Hesseman lie for weed?  We don't think so. Order now.  There we go.  You are ready for your date.  Yeah!  That's a bed head.  Yeah. Hey, look at you. You just got out of bed.  You're the underachiever every woman wants to sleep with.  - Hey, big date tonight? - Yeah, yeah.  Hey, listen, I'm sorry about Olivia rejecting you.  Oh, I haven't given up yet, Brian.  She says she wants a more mature, grown-up man,  so all I've got to do is be more grown-up.  - What are you doing? - Just cleaning out your brush, man.  - Hi, Jillian. - Hi, Brian, ready to go?  - Hey, baby. - Hi, Stewie.  What the hell are you doing?  Not much, really. Just me and my pubes hanging out.  Oh, dear God.  Boy, I am so beat from doing adult stuff all day.  So am I.  I just kind of feel like kicking it tonight.  Oh, look at that. I'm growing all the time.  Hey, Jillian, can you give me a minute?  You ever just let your balls hang out, B-ri?  You ever do that, B-roney?  Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was Bri?  - Give me my hair back. - What the hell, man.  Stewie, this is not going to convince Olivia that you're grown-up enough for her.  Oh, yeah? What do you know about women?  You want to know how to get women?  There's only one place in town you need to observe.  Just watch.  I am not doing that, Glenn.  Come on, beautiful, keep an open mind.  - You're a sick man. - Hey, keep it down.  I don't want my neighbors seeing  a fat, old, dirty whore screaming at me on my front lawn.  ""Whore""?  - Well, maybe I should come inside. - Well, maybe you should.  What the deuce?  Why the hell would she respond positively to such a negative comment?  Unless  Brian, do women like it when you treat them like crap?  Well, I don't know if you want to be that black and white about it.  That's it, isn't it?  Women respond when you treat them like crap.  Well, Olivia, prepare to meet a much darker Stewie Griffin.  Hey, babe. What do you say? We going out Saturday night?  Stewie, what are you doing here?  I told you, I'm just into a different type of guy.  Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what you're into. Being ugly.  - Stewie, you're being mean. - No. If I was being mean,  when you opened the door I would have said,  ""Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home? Oh, wait, you're Olivia. ""  You see, I thought you were Ray Liotta  because your skin has the texture of a decorative autumn squash.  So, I'll pick you up at 7:00?  That sounds wonderful.  She said yes.  My God, I'm cooler than that cheetah from the commercials.  Oh, God, there is no fucking drummer better than Neil Peart!  It ain't easy being cheesy.  Oh, Smilla, your sense of snow is equaled only by your sense of love.  Peter, have you been up all night watching chick movies?  Lois, before I found these movies,  women only made me cry through my penis.  Now they make me cry through my eyes.  I've decided. I'm making my own chick flick.  What? You don't know anything about making movies.  Are you kidding? I got lots of experience in the film industry.  I was the original Pretty Woman.  You look beautiful, but there's something missing.  This is a beautiful spot, Stewie.  I know. I love coming here because you can just sit here  and people-watch, you know? Oh, look at this. Look at this guy.  Look at this. What is that? What is he doing?  Just standing there, smelling his hand? ""What is that?  ""What is that on my hand? Is that barbecue sauce?  ""When was I near barbecue sauce?""  Oh, look, look! Jewish cowboy! Jewish cowboy!  Yeah. Not gonna be so tough when the sun goes down, are you?  Better go rassle up some Chinese food, Hopalong Nussbaum.  You know, Stewie, I'm really glad I gave you another chance.  - You're a really special guy. - I know.  No, no, I'm kidding. I'm not really that self-centered.  But, you know, Olivia, I can't think of any place  I'd rather be than right here, right now with you.  Oh, look at this guy. Now, there's someone who cuts his own hair.  Yeah, no kidding. Oh, my God. Oh, check out this uptight Asian guy.  Look at that.  ""I work really hard, 'cause I'm no fun. ""  Boy, this is a great city. I don't care what anybody says.  I know. Look at that sunset against the skyline.  I know. Wow, look at that.  - A perfect end to a perfect day. - Yeah.  Well, we should probably get home. This area gets really dangerous at night.  Okay, everyone, welcome to the first day of shooting for Steel Vaginas.  Peter, this movie doesn't seem to make any sense.  It makes perfect sense, Lois.  This the scene where our heroine,  Vageena Hertz, is told by Dr. McNugget here that she has incurable chick cancer.  All right, Joe, let's lose the wheelchair and shoot this thing.  Peter, I can't lose the wheelchair. I need it to move.  - Okay, yeah, but your character can walk. - Peter, I'm handicapped. I can't walk.  Okay, Chris, roll film.  And action!  Joe, get out of the damn chair. Chris, get the cattle prod.  Okay, now give him some peanut butter so we can make it look like he's talking.  God, I hate these things.  - Sweetie, can't you just have a good time? - I don't know anybody.  - These are all your friends. - Just relax. Have some cake or something.  - Hey, hey, who do we have here? - Oh, my God! Victor?  - Hey, kiddo, how are you? - Great! Great!  Stewie, this is Victor.  We did a Flintstones Vitamins commercial together.  - ""Ten million strong and growing!"" - ""Ten million strong and growing!""  Oh, yeah, good to meet you. How are you?  Victor's such a good actor. He played a dead baby on CSI: Miami.  Yeah, I'm more into writing now.  Oh, hang on a sec. Idea for a short story.  - Guy picks his nose, then eats it. - Yeah, good luck with that.  Hey, Olivia, why don't you and I go get some punch?  Oh, actually, would you mind getting some for Victor and me while we catch up?  Or, a third option. Why doesn't Victor go get some punch for you and me?  Or maybe you and I could go away from Victor  and go get the punch?  Or none of us could have punch.  But still Victor could go away.  - Victor, would you excuse us for a second? - Sure.  Idea for a novel, guy loses his favorite blankie,  goes looking for it and finds it in the kitchen.  I amaze myself. It's genius.  It's unbelievable. I don't know where I get it from.  What the hell is wrong with you? You're acting like a jerk.  Oh, I'm acting like a jerk? What about Phony Curtis over there?  He happens to be a very intelligent, successful actor.  And, you know, he's done three national diaper commercials.  Yeah, they should put a diaper on his face. That's where the crap is coming out.  You don't own me. I can talk to whoever I want.  I don't see a ring on my finger.  I, Stewie, take you, Olivia, to be my lawfully wedded wife.  What's that, Rupert? Oh, kiss the bride. Yes.  Whoo!  Hi, honey, I'm home!  Hi, sweetie, how was your day?  Well, I was an astronaut for a while,  then I was a cowboy, and then all afternoon I was a fireman,  so it's been a long one.  - What's for dinner? - Play-Doh spaghetti.  What?  No. No, it's nothing.  Just had Play-Doh spaghetti last night.  And that's all we had last night.  - What does that mean? - Oh, I don't know, Olivia.  Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage. We have yet to have sex.  Do you even know what sex is?  That's not the point! Don't change the It's a kind of cake?  Look, can we just drop this and have a normal pretend dinner?  Fine, fine! Some days I think it was easier being QBert's roommate.  God, it's all night with this guy.  Hey, if you're gonna leave all those lights on,  I'm not gonna split the electric bill.  Sorry we're late, everyone,  but JonBenet here took forever with her makeup.  Yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip,  but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel,  so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot.  But to his credit, it's a great spot to get mugged.  Oh, wouldn't that be a shame if they took all my money out of both our wallets?  Well, it's just good to have you guys here.  - Can I get you folks something to drink? - Yes, I'll just have flat water.  Do you have Hl-C Tropical Punch?  And it begins!  What? I can't have a drink with dinner?  Oh, so dinner started at 2:00 this afternoon, did it?  Yes, about the same time you decided to hole up in the bathroom  for three hours waxing your eyebrows.  You swore you would never  I have a prominent brow, and I do what I can to get by.  Well, hey, what's important is that you're here now.  - Let's just enjoy dinner. - Yeah, can't we just have a good time?  Ask Olivia. Olivia, the three of us are having a great time.  What's your problem?  My problem is you. You're acting like a baby!  And we come to the center of the shrubbery maze.  That's what it all comes down to, isn't it?  I'm not grown up enough for you.  Well, you are a baby, aren't you?  Stay out of it. Stay out of it.  Well, if you think I'm a baby, then perhaps I should act like a baby.  Hey, could you keep that kid quiet? - Oh, what's that?  What's that, sir? What's that? I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you?  You wanna come over here and quiet me down?  - Let's not do this. - Oh, God.  - Stewie, come on. - I'm scared.  No, it's okay. It's okay. Sir? You feel strong?  You wanna come over here?  No, I want to stay here and have my steak.  - Oh, yeah? - Yeah.  - What is that, the porterhouse? - Yeah.  - How is it? - What do you care?  If we weren't fighting, would you recommend it?  Yeah, I would.  Well, I know what I'm getting.  Hello, everyone. Well, here we are, opening night.  You know, somebody once told me that making movies was easy.  Yeah. Yeah, you know what else is easy?  - Open heart surgery. Yes!  Yeah, thanks for coming, Fouad.  Oh! Is funny because open heart surgery not easy at all.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Calm down, Fouad.  So, without further dudes, let's watch this thing.  At first, I didn't believe in women and unicorns,  but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff,  and before I knew Vageena Hertz.  Sorry.  When Vageena was first born, I had a small heart and a lot to learn.  Push, honey! Hurry up and give me my baby boy!  Cleveland, more SpaghettiOs.  Oh, good, a baby.  Oh, no, it's a girl.  And I hate girls.  But one day,  Vageena went swimming too soon after eating a sandwich,  and this happened.  Help! Help!  I'm drowning! Help!  We gotta get this woman to surgery time. Right stat now!  But it was too late,  and she died from a rotten vagina.  Wow, that was the worst piece of crap I've ever seen.  Oh, my God, that was an abomination.  That was awful. Awful. Awful, awful.  My ass is actually sore.  My ass is actually sore.  - Hey, where's Olivia? - Oh, she's probably up at the house.  - Stewie? - Yeah?  It's not your fault.  - What? - It's not your fault.  I know.  It's not your fault.  I know.  No, Stewie, Stewie.  It's not your fault.  Don't do this to me, man. Not you, man.  - It's not your fault. - Screw you! Cut it out, man!  It's not your fault.  Why is it so hard?  I didn't know it was gonna be so hard.  Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys  and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough.  You want her to see you as an adult? Well, this is adulthood.  You're right, Brian. I can't hide from this relationship.  It's my responsibility to deal with it.  I mean, what kind of a man would I be if I ran off now?  Well, you'd be a black man.  - Whoa, what was that? - I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. That was my father talking.  You gotta work on that, man.  Bad dog.  Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I  Oh, Stewie!  I thought you were at Chuck E. Cheese with your mom.  No. A four-year-old died in the ball pit.  We had to cancel.  Is that the Silly Putty I bought you this weekend?  Stewie, this isn't what it looks like.  Yeah, Stewie, I just dropped by to  Ain't nobody talking to you.  Is  that  the Silly Putty  I bought you  this weekend?  You know, I'm really I'm sensing something here that  I should be going.  No, how about you stay here and I leave and never come back again?  Stewie, this isn't how I wanted it to end.  But you did want it to end. You've made that perfectly clear.  - Listen, are you gonna be all right? - Yeah, I'll be fine.  Is that smoke?  Idea for a farce, cheating wife and pompous ass burned alive.  So, what happened?  Well, you want to know what I learned this week?  Being a grown-up sucks.  Women, Brian, what a royal pain in the ass!  It's like, why can't you just hang out with guys?  You know, just live with someone of your own sex.  Just do what you would do with women,  but with your buddy. You know, why don't guys just do that?  They do. It's called being gay.  Oh, that's what gay is?  Oh, yeah, I could totally get into that."

                    			We now return to Sunday Golf on CBS.  And Mickelson here, trying to save par.  And there's Mickelson's wife. God, is she hot.  Look at that rack. There's a downhill lie for you.  Oh, and they're just out there, begging to be touched. Pleading.  How many golf balls do you think she can fit in her mouth?  I'd hit that one in the rough, if you know what I'm saying.  Who are you kidding, Greg?  You'd  her for a week, and then get tired her.  Yeah, you're right. That's what I do. That's my thing.  - But a hell of a week though. - Hell of a week.  Oh, my God! The power's out!  What are we gonna do now?  Well, we could light some candles and read.  - Yeah, right. - Yeah, that would be great  Yeah. Read the inside of my butt.  We could tell stories.  Hey, Dad, why don't you tell the story about when I was born?  Yeah, we got halfway home with the afterbirth  before we had to go back to the hospital and swap it out for Meg.  The end.  Now, I got a better one.  This is a story of love and loss,  fathers and sons,  and a foresight to retain international merchandising rights.  This is the story  of Star Wars.  Let's begin with part four.  Family Guy Blue Harvet    You hear that?  Sounds like we're being boarded from the rear.  And not the, ""Hey, take a deep breath, let's experiment""  kind of boarded from the rear.  Beep boop.  Could you hold on to this bag?  What if they come in a different door?  Damn! I was two days from retirement.  R-2?  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.  - All right, now what do I click? - Click ""preferences.""  - Okay, I clicked preferences. - Now go to ""default media browser"".  Okay, there's a little hourglass, and it's not letting me do anything.  - It says ""buffering."" What is that? - Just give it a minute.  All I'm trying to do is make an mpeg.  All I'm trying to do is tell you to wait a minute.  Okay, relax.  Now click ""import video file.""  All right.  It's telling me I have to download RealPlayer 7.  You know what? I'll just bring it to him myself.  There she is!  Do you still got that bag I gave you?  It's gonna be a long ride.  Hold your fire. There's no life-forms aboard.  ""Hold your fire""? What, are we paying by the laser now?  You don't do the budget, Terry. I do.  Hey, I'm gonna do some crosswords, but  - that doesn't mean I don't want to talk. - Oh, yeah, yeah.  My God! Look at this mess!  ""Hey, Darth Vader's gonna be here. Should we maybe clean the place up?""  ""Nah. It's okay. He won't mind.""  Well, well! Princess Leia.  Are you prepared to tell me what you've done with the stolen Death Star plans?  All right, Lord Vader. You win.  I've hidden the plans in one of these 26 briefcases.  Ooh! Ooh! Okay, okay!  Uh uh I'm feeling number 14! Let's go with number 14!  Oh, it's okay. I'm just happy to be on TV.  All right. Take her away.  Okay, here's another one. Who would you rather do :  Jabba the Hutt right after a shower or a service droid?  My father was a service droid!  Hey, where ya going?  You can kiss the lower part of the back of the canister that is my body.  Oh, man! This looks like the wrong neighborhood.  Oh, boy.  It's okay, R-2. Calm down. Be cool.  I ain't done nothing to antagonize nobody.  What? A droid can't walk down the desert no more?  I got rights, too.  Who's there?!  Any attack made by the rebels against this station would be a useless gesture  no matter what technical data they've obtained.  This station is now the ultimate power in the universe.  That is fantastic. Terrific work.  - So, no weaknesses at all, huh? - Nuh  No.  You, uh you hesitated there. Is there something I should know?  No. It's virtually indestructible. Like, 99.9%.  Uh okay.  Wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't ask. What's the .01?  Well, I I mean, there's this little hole  It was kind of an aesthetic choice by the architect.  And, if you shoot a laser into this hole  the station blows up.  That sounds like a pretty big design flaw there.  No, no, no. The hole's only two meters across.  Well, that's no bigger than a womprat.  Exactly.  And even to get within range of it, you have to skim along this whole trench.  It's not a big deal.  Can't we board it up? Or, you know, put some plywood over it or something?  Well, that would look terrible.  I mean, we gotta think about resale.  Resale? What are you talking about?  This property is right above Sunset. The value is only gonna go up.  Lord Vader, your inside references to the Los Angeles real estate market  haven't given you the clairvoyance to turn a profit on that condo in Glendale,  nor has it  I find your lack of faith disturbing.  That property is in a prime location.  20 minutes to the beach, 20 minutes to downtown  There's nothing to do downtown.  Enough of this!  Vader, release him!  As you wish.  All right, so we gonna plug up that hole?  Yeah. We can get it done tomorrow if price is no object.  - We'll get estimates. - Get estimates. Yeah.  Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this direction.  - Look, sir. Droids! - Look! A penny!  Hey, thanks for the sex, early '90s printer.  All right, bring 'em on out.  Oh, God, it's a hundred degrees out here!  If I pass out, please note that I'm wearing a Life Call bracelet  with all my insurance information.  Luke?  Luke!  Luke!  What?!  Tell Uncle Owen not to tell you that your father is Darth Vader.  Aunt Beru, when are you guys gonna let me join  the rebellion like all my friends?  Oh, pff! Stop whining, Luke, and come have some blue milk.  One of these days,  I'm just gonna take off and join the rebellion whether you like it or not!  Over my burned carcass!  Hey, shut up with-a da nois-a!  Hey, shut-up-a with-a da shut-up-a!  You shut-up-a with-a da shut- up-a!  Shut-up-a yo face! Now-a my dog-a won't-a shut-up-a!  - Why you no-a shut up-a? - I make-a you-a shut-up-a!  - You two-a shut-up-a! - Hey, I poke out-a my head!  Someday  I'll get off this rock and fight the empire.  John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra, everybody!  Now do the theme to The People's Court.  Oh, this oil bath is going to feel so good.  Hey, you guys think that '90s printer looked clean, right?  Hey, there's something stuck in this R-2 unit.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.  Whoever she is, she sounds like she's in trouble.  Is there any more to this message?  Intergalactic proton-powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids!  Intergalactic proton-powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids!  Intergalactic proton-powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids!  Hi, I'm Darth Harrington of Darth Harrington's Intergalactic Proton-  Powered Electrical-Tentacled Advertising Droids Emporium and Moon Base.  Due to a garbled sup-space transmission,  I am currently overstocked on all intergalactic proton-  powered electrical-tentacled advertising droids,  and I am passing the savings on to you!  She said, ""Obi-Wan Kenobi.""  I wonder if she means old Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Well, I guess I'll go bull's-eye some womprats in my T-16.  My God, you shoot small animals for fun?  That's the first indicator of a serial killer, you freak.  There's two suns and no women!  What the hell am I supposed to do?!  Master Luke, he's gone, he's gone!  What?  R-2, he took off in the middle of the night! We got to find him!  Oh, what the phantom menace is that guy's problem?  Hey, mind if I turn on the radio?  WTAT, Tatooine's all-talk radio.  My good friends, the liberal galactic media is at it again. They never stop.  Now they're trying to convince us that Hoth is melting.  Well, that's crazy. Just trying to scare us.  And if that weren't enough to get you mad,  we now have news that Lando Calrissian has been made the chief administrator  of the Bespin Mining Facility.  Gee, I wonder how he got that job.  Well, let me tell you how he got that job.  Affirmative action strikes again.  The time is 8:50.  - R-2, what are you doing out here? - Beep-boop-beep.  He says, ""There are several creatures approaching from the southeast.""  That's not what I said.  I said there ain't a pack of menthols on this planet.  Well, I see some Bantha tracks, but I don't see any  Wait a minute. There's Sand People, all right. I can see one of them now.  Who the hell are you?  One lucky sumbitch.  So, Luke, what brings your muscley arms out this way?  I'll show you, Mr. Obi-Wan.  R-2, play him the message.  General Kenobi, many years ago, you served my father in the Clone Wars.  We need your help again.  And not to get too personal, but  you owe us after that mess you got into back on Alderaan.  and we pay to keep the families of those children quiet, so  Oh, this is just just like logistical stuff.  I'll check that later.  Joey Lawrence haircut,  so I'll assume we can count on your help  to get the Death Star plans to my father on Alderaan.  The plans are stored inside this R-2 unit.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.  All right now, what do I click?  Luke, you must learn the ways of the Force and come with meto Alderaan.  What's the Force?  The Force is what gives a Jedi knight his power.  It surrounds us. It penetrates us.  Here, check this out.  Wow! This is cool!  Yeah, everyone in the neighborhood has one.  Hey, why would you hang that up? It looks so tantalizing.  You know, the Empire's gonna come looking for these droids.  But if they find out who the Jewas sold them to, that could lead them back  home.  Luke, wait! It's too dangerous!  Get your fat space ass back here.  Uncle Owen?  Aunt Beru?  Oh, my God!  John Williams!  Great, now we got to do the rest of this thing with Danny Elfman.  Mos Eisley Space Port.  You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy.  My sister Regina D2 lives here.  - Is she single? - She's a lezbot.  - He doesn't like you. - Sorry.  - I don't like you either. - You don't even know me.  You know what? That's fair.  I'm Pignose and this is my brother-in-law Scott.  - He's visiting from Hoth. - I don't know why they call it Hoth.  - They should call it ""Coldth."" - Okay, settle down.  I'm up after the band.  Thank you. We're the Cantina Band. If you have any requests, shout them out.  Play that same song. All right, same song. Here we go.  Hi. My sexy friend and I  are looking for a ship to take us to Alderaan,  and I'm willing to pay big money.  Well, you've come to the right place.  I'm Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon  and the only actor whose career isn't destroyed by this movie.  - Is it a fast ship? - Are you kidding?  It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.  Um  Isn't a parsec a unit of distance, not time?  No, no, no, no.  Chewie, take these guys to the ship and get her ready.  Always gargle before a takeoff. Waka-waka. All right, let's go.  Greedo, as a matter of fact, I was just going to see Jaba and tell him  - Well, what do you think? - What a piece of junk.  Thank you. This was my brother's. He died of leukemia. How do you feel now?  You got any strawberry milkin there?  No, but she'll make .5 past lightspeed.  If you want, I'll show you around  since no one's trying to stop the ship or blast us.  Stop that ship! Blast them!  Oh, now I can't show you around. Quick, get in the ship.  Looks like we got Imperial cruisers on our tail.  Oh, look at that one on the left. Get off your cell phone. You are driving.  They're gaining on us!  We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.  Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them.  Uh, that, thatwas your maneuver,  moving slightly to the left?  Well, I mean, we're not in the same place we were, huh?  - That ought to confuse them. - Yeah, but you hardly did anything.  You just started listinglazily to the left.  I'm pretty sure they can keep up.  - Where did they go?! - There they are.  They're listinglazily to the left. Go left! Left!  Boy, this guy knows some maneuvers.  All right, strap yourselves in. I'm about to make the jump to lightspeed.  Did he say ""strap in"" or ""strap on""?  Man, hyperspace always looks so freaky.  Governor Tarkin,  I recognized your foul stench as soon as I was brought on board.  Um, actually, that's me.  I made a Darth doody.  Princess Leia, we've chosen to test our Death Star planet blower-upper gun  on your home planet of Alderaan.  No!  She said, ""No."" Should we still do it?  Yeah.  So anyway, I says, ""Forget the dental plan.""  ""Forget sick leave. I just want a railing,"" you know?  ""One railing right here.""  Yeah, I know. I've almost fallen over that thing so many times.  - So what did they say? - Oh, get this.  They said they're worried we'd be leaning all day.  - They said that? - Yeah.  Well, none of this will matter when we're famous singers.  - How am I doing? - Just keep your knees bent.  Imagine you're spreading butter on a big piece of bread.  That's it. Spread that butter  with the Force.  Ha! You guys seem like crazy morons to me.  You don't believe in the Force, do you?  Oh, you mean that thing you just found out about, like,  three hours ago and are now judging me for not believing in it?  Do you believe in anything?  Uh, yeah. Didn't you see my Kabbalah bracelet?  - What's Kabbalah? - About a buck seventy-five.  Honestly, I have no idea. I'm just a slave to trends.  What the hell?  Oh, my God, we came out of hyperspace into an asteroid field.  Alderaan's been destroyed by the Empire.  Maybe we should head for that small moon  that's clearly a small moon and not anything else.  That's no moon.  It's a space station.  Oh, crap, that got us in a tractor beam.  Well, they're not gonna get me without a fight.  You can't win.  But there are alternatives to fighting.  Like what?  Like getting the hell out of here!  No, just kidding. Can you imagine if I was like that?  All right, just follow my lead and act real cool.  All right, I'm gonna go knock out that tractor beam.  And we'll go rescue the princess.  You know Luke, this may be the last time we see each other.  So there's something I want you to know.  Now I've  had the time of my life  And I owe it all to you  I've been waiting for so long  Now I've finally found someone to stand by me  So we take each other's hand  Cause we seem to understand the urgency  Just remember  You're the one thing  I can't get enough of  So I'll tell you something  This could be love Because  I've had the time of my life  No I never felt this way before  Yes, I swear, it's the truth  And I owe it all to you  Holly smoke!  So, whate  we are on the first floor?  Uh, we are on the second floor.  No, no, no,  here's the Banana republic and we just pass that.  Uh   it's right back there. We, we, uh  we park on Macy's side,   So now we must be other here by the JCPenney.  It looks that the first floor is mostly main stuff,   and there's a lady Foot Locker right other there.   All right, so we are on the third floor.  All right, let's get in the elevator.  And hurry up, 'cause the smell of that Mrs. Fields is killing me.  Where are you taking this thing?  Prisoner transfer from cell block 1138.  You think you could get me a room by the pool?  Is funny because you are prisoner.  And there is no pool because is Death Star.  We got to find out what cell this princess of yours is in.  - There it is, 2187. - I'm on it.  Uh, everything's under control here. Situation normal.  What happened?  We, uh, had a slight weapons malfunction, but  everything's perfectly all right. We're fine.  We're all fine here now  thank you.  How are you?  Uh I've been better.  - Well, tell me what's up. - Well,  I'm in this relationship and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  I like her, but we're not really connecting.  - How long's it been? - About ten months.  - And how often do you see each other? - Couple of times a week.  Well, why don't you try seeing each other a little more often  and see if you connect a little more.  And if not, it may be time to move on.  Thanks for calling.  This is Han Solo,  and I'm going to be keeping you company for the next few hours,  right here on the midnight shift.  Something's telling me it might be you  It's telling me it might be you  Aren't you a little fat to be a storm trooper?  Well, stay here and rot, you stuck-up bitch.  Wait. Who are you?  I'm Luke Skywalker.  Me and Han Solo and Obi-Wan are here to rescue you.  - Wait, Obi-Wan Kenobi? - Yeah.  Suddenly I'm not so fat, huh?  Come on, into the garbage chute.  She's right. Come on, Chewbacca.  Are you kidding? It's probably full of disease. I'm not jumping in there.  Not even if I throw this pig's ear?  - Oh, come on, that's not fair. - Go get it!  Oh, boy, great idea, Princess, diving into a pile of garbage.  When we get out of here, maybe you can show me around  your home planet of Alderaan.  Aw!  Too soon?  Hey, it could be worse.  It's worse.  The walls are closing!  Listen to them, R-2. They're dying. What do we do?  Only one thing to do, man.  You still got that bag I gave you?  Man, I wish I could listen to some Tattooine, Wind and Fire right now.  Mm  So you think the Empire's gonna fall, man?  I-I-I don'tI don't know, man.  H-How you, how you, how you, how you doing right now?  Good. Why?  I think,  I think, I think I I think I may be having sort of a mini freak-out here.  - Oh. - Just-Just  Just tell me I don't have to stay in this room.  What?  Just tell me right now that I that I don't have to stay in this room.  You don't have to stay in this room.  Oh, thank God.  Thank God we're saved.  Look at this. Who throws out half a pizza?  And look at this couch.  Somebody threw out a whole couch and it's in great shape.  Yeah, you put a little Febreze on that,  scrub it out a little bit, it'll look great in your apartment.  You know what?  I know we have a dangerous job to do here, but  I'm taking this.  I'm taking this couch.  All right, you ready?  All right, one two three.  - Easy, easy, easy. - Okay.  - Stop, stop, stop, stop - What? What?  - No, no, no, no Twist it. - I am.  No, no, no, no, no, other way. You're twisting the wrong way.  - What do you want me to do? - Just look down, all right.  Just look at me, look what I'm doing.  - You see the way I'm twisting it? - Yeah.  - Turn it that way from your end. - Okay.  No, no, no, no, no.  Put it down. Put it down. Just drop it.  All right. All right.  All right, let's  Just hang on and figure this out.  Han, there are storm troopers all over the place.  Shouldn't we be getting out of here?  All right, okay, all right, okay.  I got it, I know okay, okay  Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna take the cushions off,  unscrew the legs,  take the mattress out and this whole thing is gonna be a lot simpler.  It's easier than we're making it.  Hey, did you hear something?  Probably just another drill.  You know that last drill we had?  I was about to finally bone my girlfriend,  and then we heard that there was this drill  and she told me there was no way.  So, Obi-Wan  we meet again.  What part of ""stay 50 yards away at all times"" don't you understand?  Uh-oh.  Your powers are weak, old man.  Obi-Wan!  Boy, you got here just in time.  No!  All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!  All right, twist it counter-clockwise.  I am twisting it. You're twisting it the other way.  I mean counter-clockwise from where I'm standing  so so th so then you  so clockwise.  You twist it clockwise.  Okay okay, go.  You know what? Put it down, put it down for a second.  - My fingers are killing me. - Han, they're shooting at us!  You know what? Lift it up tall ways.  Aw, for cr oh, it's wedged. It's wedged.  You know what? It's not going anywhere. Let's just take off,  we'll deal with it later.  You get in the cockpit and I'll just  I'll hang on to this thing as we go.  Easy.  I can't believe he's gone.  I know, Luke, but it's true.  He's gone.  I mean, you saw him get beheaded.  Nobody lives through that Not for long, anyway.  I mean, sometimes the brain is still active for a few minutes  after the beheading, but  to be honest, I can't imagine a worse kind of hell.  And unfortunately,  hell is probably where he'll end up,  because the Christians don't look too kindly on the whole Force thing.  Come on, kid, we're not out of the woods yet.  Here they come!  - Hey, Han! - What?!  - Why do they call them ""Tie Fighters""? - - No idea!  They're coming too fast!  Oh, boy. Nickel for every time that's happened.  Just keep shooting, Luke!  That's how we do it in my neighborhood, bitch!  I got him! I got him!  Great, kid! Don't get penis-y!  I just want to tell you both  Good luck. We're all counting on you.  Mom?  Yeah. Yeah we won.  Yeah, we won the battle.  Yeah, I'm calling like you asked.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay, but okay, but I gotta go  I got other stuff to do.  O-Okay  Okay, okay, but I gotta go.  Okay.  Okay, yes.  Yes.  Yes, yes, Mom.  I-I love you too, Mom. Okay, all right, good-bye.  P-choo. P-choo.  Gotcha.  Thanks to the information in this R-2 unit provided by Princess Leia,  we should be able to mount a successful offensive on the Death Star.  But first,  please take a moment to watch this instructional video.  Nothing but net.  Hi,  I'm Magic Johnson with a few tips on blowing up the Death Star.  First off, never forget your objective.  There gonna be so many folks coming at you to slow you down,  you might feel like you got a bull's-eye on your head.  No, but they will be trying to kill you.  Also, don't forget you have teammates out there watching your back.  Unless you been messing around with their wife or girlfriend.  No, but they will be there to help you.  Lastly,  you wanna make sure you step back and take cover after you sink that bucket,  'cause that sky gonna light up like the Fourth of July.  No, but there will be a large explosion.  Well, kid, I guess this is good-bye.  So, you got your reward and you're leaving. Is that it?  When you say it that way, I sound like a douche,  but, yeah, that's what I'm doing.  What'd you get for a reward anyway?  Uh, let's see, I got 10% off a Netflix membership,  uh  some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar,  assorted lotions, and a little plastic champagne bottle full of jelly beans  and a little bear.  See? Little bear?  ""Hey, Luke. We had fun on the Death Star.""  Well, take care of yourself, Han.  I guess that's what you're best at.  Oh, look, a light saber cheese knife.  Yuck.  All wings. Check in.  - Red three standing by. - Red six standing by.  - Red five standing by. - Red Buttons standing by.  - Redd Foxx standin' by! - Big Red standing by.  - Red October standing by. - Helen Reddy standing by.  Simply Red standing by.  I'm going in. Cover me, Porkins!  Uh, having a little trouble here.  Careful, Redd Foxx, there's one right on your tail!  Ahh! I'm comin', Elizabeth!  Use the Force, Luke.  - Obi-Wan? - Yeah, it's me.  Use the Force.  Force that thing in there.  Just like I showed you with those puppets.  but don't tell anybody 'cause you'll get in trouble.  Clark, I don't like the look of this neighborhood.  Come on, Ellen, it's important for the kids  to witness the plight of the rebellion.  Kids, you noticing all this plight?  Roll 'em up!  The Force is strong with this one.  you, you son of a bitch!  What am I, R2-Pac?!  The Death Star is getting closer.  And Leia's getting larger!  I have you now, young Skywalker!  And with today's gas prices, not a minute too soon.  What the deuce?!  Look at this.  Look how much more comfortable we are now shooting stuff.  Luke, the Force will be with you always.  And so will I.  Always.  'Course, when you get older and get some crow's feet,  I might lose interest.  The end.  Well, Dad,  thanks for keeping us entertained.  That was a great story.  Yeah, but  didn't Robot Chicken already do this three months ago?  Well, I wouldn't worry about it, Chris.  I don't think people are even aware of that show's existence.  Well, I don't know, Dad. I think a decent number of people watch it.  Oh really? Define ""decent.""  I think it's the highest-rated show on Cartoon Network  and the Star Wars episode doubled that audience.  Well, yeah, but double ten people is like 20 people,  so, I mean, what kind of numbers are we talking about here, you know?  Don't be glib about this stuff, Dad.  It's a legitimate show and they beat you to the punch.  Uh I don't know about that, Chris.  I mean, to me, a legitimate show is on ABC, CBS, NBC  You know, one of the real networks.  I don't know about that, Dad.  And besides, what's up with that 15-minute runtime?  What is that? It's like 15 minutes of guys playing with Star Wars dolls?  - Oh, yay, yay, tune me into that. - Oh, so you do know the show.  I read part of a review online. I am not a fan.  You know, Dad, you're a real jerk!"

                    			Movin' Out (Brian's Song) This Tuesday on Lifetime, Valerie Bertinelli stars in a Lifetime original movie. You know, Doctor, you said you were going to cure my cancer, but all you did was rape me! I'm starting to think I don't have cancer at all. Well, you're right, about the rape part, but I'm sorry, you still do have cancer. Valerie Bertinelli in Brian, did you know that Daryl Hannah has one wooden finger? Really? Where did you read that? - In Pee-opple magazine. - Huh. Jillian, can you, uh, run and get me a beer from the kitchen? Oh, yeah, sure, no problem. Hey, Jillian, you and Brian got big plans tonight? Yeah. Brian's taking me to Disney On Ice. - I want to go. - Uh Well, Peter, if you want, you can have my ticket. What? But, Brian, I thought you wanted to go? Stitch is going to do a skating duet with Sebastian the Crab. It's not really my cup of tea. Plus, Walt Disney was an outspoken anti-Semite. So, Disney, ABC, ESPN, Touchstone these would all be things to avoid. Well, oh, okay. Um, Peter, you want to go see Disney On Ice? Oh, God, yes! I'll be right back. I'm going to go put on my Donald Duck costume. Ready. Meg, lend me 25 cents so I can ride the toy airplane outside and make the immigrant kids jealous. Look at me! I'm having a magical aerial adventure because my family has disposable income. Here you go. What is this? It's a pamphlet on why I'm bombing you. - Hey, Meg. - Hi, Carl. How come you're always here by yourself? Are you like a bitch or something? - No, I have friends. - Oh. Well, you should bring some of them in here. - Any of them have braces? - Yeah. I love braces. My mom has 'em. Well, listen, um I need disposable diapers, but it looks like you're out. Oh, no, I got some in the stockroom. Hang on. Oh, Vince Vaughn's on the cover of Entertainment Weekly. Here's my summary of every Vince Vaughn movie: ""Oh, I'm incapable of loving another person."" ""Oh, wait, no, I'm not. The end."" I don't even want to look at his face. Stewie, what the hell are you doing?! Oh, my God! Now I've got to clean up this up! - Carl, I'm so sorry. - Wow, Meg, you alphabetized all the magazines. - Hey, you want a job? - What? Me? - Here? Yeah, sure! - Great. You start tomorrow. - Hey, Chris. - Hey, Meg. I don't have any money so I'm going to have to pay for these comic books with my poo. Chris, how come you don't have any money? I thought you had a paper route. Well, I'm taking a sabbatical to focus on my pottery. Oh. - How's that working out? - Not good, Meg, not good. Well, maybe I can talk to Carl and get you a job here. - You could do that?! - Absolutely. Carl totally trusts me. You and I will be the best brother-sister team since Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal. - I'm more off-putting. - No, I'm more off-putting. I'm more unattractive to put in a lead role. Well, I'm a bigger box office drag. Kids, kids. You're both just awful. Oh, hi, Brian. I thought you were spending the day with Jillian. I was, but Peter took her off my hands. Perfect timing. I've been feeling a little smothered lately. Plus, it's given me a chance to work on my novel. - And I finally have a title. - Oh, what is it? ""Faster Than the Speed of Love."" That is the worst title I've ever heard. No, it's the story of a boy who has to rescue his father, who's a pilot, that's been taken captive by a militant Islamic country. - That's the movie Iron Eagle! - What? Is that, is that a recent film? They made three sequels! Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's gotta gather all these old World War II pilots to help him rescue his father. That's one of the sequels! Well, well, in mine, one of the World War II guys is Japanese, but they accept him anyway. I'm going to pee in my pants! Boy, it sure is fun hanging out with you, Peter. That means ""thank you"" in my new language I'm inventing. Anyway, all I was saying is, if you think about it, it shouldn't have been Ferris Bueller's Day Off. It should've been Ferris Bueller's Day On, 'cause that was all the stuff he wanted to do. Yeah. And he was so ""on"" that day, so it kind of works on two levels. Well, I don't know what you mean by that, but how about that Cameron, huh? - Oh, definitely. - Am I right? It was his day off, too. That is just what I was going to His day off that is just what I was going to say. You know, you are a catch, young lady. You know that? I don't know when the hell Brian is going to open his eyes and get serious with you. I really wish he would. It'd be so great if we were at least living together. Well, you need to just lay it on the line with him. Either he commits to you, or you're gone. What the hell did you do?! Because of what you said, Jillian wants us to move in together! Well, I think you should, Brian. She's beautiful, she's funny, and she is smart as the day is wide. Don't you understand?! I don't want a committed relationship with Jillian. Well, it sounds like she does. And if you're never going to get serious, then you're not being fair to her. You don't really think I'm like that, do you? Prove me wrong. All right, I will, Lois. I will ask her to move in with me. and you'll see, I've got what it takes. Boy, you know, I gotta tell you, Jillian, this move is really working out great. - It just feels right, you know. - Cool! - Rock on, Brian! - Okay, done. Stewie. Hey. What's up? Oh, I was just on my way back from the cobbler. Figured before I stopped by the apothecary, I'd come here, and then it's off to the haberdasher. These turn-of-the-century business jokes doing anything for you? Not really. - Did you use the jokes? - Yeah, they're not landing. Got your mail. So, how's it going? I tell you, Stewie, it's going great. And that's the worst part. I can't afford the rent. I'll be lucky if I can make it to the end of the month. Sounds like you need a roommate. Where did you get that kind of money? I picked up Chris's paper route. Oh, OshKosh B'Gosh, it's a brand-new paperboy. That's a mighty full sack you're carrying. Piss off, you perverted old freak! Oh, we got a fighter. Wow, you were almost in a dirt bike race? Yeah, yeah, I filled out most of the paperwork, too. You are the coolest guy I have ever met. Yep. Hey, guys. Um Chris, I need you to stack the boxes in the back for me. Uh, you know what, Meg? Why don't you do that? I need Chris up here with me. But the boxes are really heavy. Oh, that's 'cause there's a bunch of stuff in them. Huh? Chris? Yeah. Uh, Chris, you ever see the movie Cruel Intentions? No. Oh, Selma Blair and Sarah Michelle Gellar make out. It's pretty hot. - 47 minutes, 16 seconds in. - No way! Yeah, yeah. You know what's another great movie? Career Opportunities with Jennifer Connelly. I mean, that's one of those movies that I mean, she's really hot in it, but it's also a good movie. She was in A Beautiful Mind, and I've gotta say, the direction was excellent but I was very disappointed that she, um wore clothes the entire film. Was she hot in it? Yeah, in the way that, like, classy women with expensive clothing who never take the moff are hot, you know? No. All right. So, like, you see a hotgirl, and you're like, okay, I appreciate your exterior beauty 'cause you definitely worked at it with the clothing, and the jewelry, and the makeup and stuff, but secretly, I'm just like, hey, man where is the chase and how do I cut to it? Wow, you're smart. What? Listen, I hope you don't mind Stewie staying with us for a little while. He, uh, he just gets really lonely without me at home. You're so fatherly. It really turns me on. Brian, there's no more graham crackers! They're in the cabinet! I don't see them! They're right in front of you! Which cabinet are you looking at?! - Can't you just come in here?! - No, I'm busy! Oh, no! Oh, no, Brian! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, Brian, we need paper towels! Oh! Oh, it's going under the fridge! Oh! Just use a dish towel! There aren't any, Brian! You need to come in here! Oh! We are going to have ants! Oh-ho, a hundred points! Meg, clean up aisle two. What the hell is this?! I am not cleaning this up. Meg, less talkie, more sweepy. Shut up, Chris! You can't tell me what to do. Uh, actually, Meg, as your supervisor, he can. Supervisor? - Yeah, I promoted him this morning. - Promoted me this morning. What?! Carl, you promised me that assistant manager position. Uh, Meg, things change. Hey, you ever see Broken Lizard's Club Dread? No. Well, go see that movie and absorb its message, and you'll get the gist of what I'm talking about. - Carl, this isn't fair! - All right, then, you're fired. What? But No, you can't Don't worry about it, Chris, she'll be fine. Hey, by the way, you know who else is hot in kind of a screwed up way? Mary Stuart Masterson. Yeah, yeah, in that sort of ""you think you could get her,"" ""cause she could be your brother"" kind of thing. Like, she's gettable, you know, like, like, Elizabeth Shue. - Oh, I remember her. - Yeah. You know, she was in Leaving Las Vegas in addition to Adventures in Babysitting. One of those underrated actresses that was always talented and beautiful, and never quite popped, if you know the meaning. - Who, Elizabeth Shue? - Yeah. Like totally naked in, um, Leaving Las Vegas. And, uh, still ,still so hot. Like, uh - I don't see art films. - Like, like, crazy hot. Yeah, it's about 39 minutes, It's a really exceptional sequence. I mean, Nick Cage is poisoning himself with alcohol. He's a failed writer who just decides that, ""Ooh, I'm going to have a big last hurrah in Las Vegas."" And then he meets a whore and pays her a bunch of money to stay with him, uh, and have sex with him while he murders himself slowly. And, you know, she's game for it, but she catches feelings midway through and the whole thing changes. Wow, h-have youseen Cocktail? - Uh, yeah, yeah. - She was in that. - She was in that. - Yeah. - Ah, ah, you like that? - Yeah, it's rad! Don't talk, please. Hang on, let me get a condom. Brian, are you guys up? Stewie, what the hell are you doing? Go back to bed. But I'm not tired. And I'm lonely. Oh, come get in bed with us. Ooh, all right, ""Dear Penthouse Forum."" No, no, Stewie, go away! Brian, don't be mean to him. Yes, Brian, if you're mean to me, I'll stop paying the rent. - What did he say? - Uh, nothing. That's right, I'm paying Mr. Lickity-self's half of the rent. Is that true? All right, yes, fine, it's true! Why didn't you say anything? Because you wanted me to move in so badly, and God knows, I didn't want to Wait You didn't want to move in with me? Well, honestly, no. Oh, my God! I've never felt so stupid! - Really? - Really? Well, I don't want to be your guilty burden, Brian! We're through! Jillian, wait! Damn it. I'm sorry, Brian. You'll feel better in the morning. She's gone. Jillian's gone. Look, Brian, I know you're upset now, but I think it's important to see things in perspective. Remember when Alex P. Keaton lost his girlfriend? And then he got another one, and everything was all right? And then he got Parkinson's. Yikes. You know, Stewie, you're right. This is not a loss, it's an opportunity. I'm free now. I've got my own place, no attachments. There you are. That's just the kind of can-do spirit that built this nation. ""We hold these truths to be self-evident,"" ""that all men are created equal."" - Except the Jews. - Franklin, for the fifth time, I'm sorry you overpaid for your house, but it's not going in. - You'll be sorry. - Noted. Moving on. So, Meg, any luck finding another job? No. Hardly anybody's hiring right now. The only job I could find was for a phone sex line, and I sucked at it. What am I wearing? Um a hat and glasses. What kind of underwear? Um I don't know. Big underwear, I guess. I'm sorry, what? Oh, what would I do to you? Well, um I guess maybe we'd get pizza. And we could watch House. All right, I am totally flaccid, but thank you anyway, m'am, I appreciated your time. Mom, check it out! I just got my paycheck and my salary's doubled ever since Meg got fired. Oh, shut up, you bastard! Chris, we should have a talk about Meg. She's really upset that she got fired. Gee, I didn't realize working at the store meant that much to her. You know, it would mean the world to her if she could get her job back. And you'd be one terrific brother if you could help her. Well, gosh, Mom, I'll sure try. Poor Meg. She got a worse deal than that no-armed baseball player, Bucky LaGrange. Ground ball to shortstop. The throw is to second, and again, the ball sails past LaGrange into right field. The runners will score and a cascade of ""boos"" rain down from the stands as clearly the fans' sympathy for this scrappy, little no-armed man has run out. Now, granted the throw was a little wide, but you've got to believe that a two-armed player would've made the catch. In fact a one-armed player would have at least had a shot at it, which calls to mind the question once again, why, with all the two-armed youngsters waiting in the minor leagues, does this team stick with an arm-less second baseman? - And he hasn't had a hit in ever. - In ever, Jerry. In ever. What the hell?! What are you people doing in my apartment? Hey! You made it. What is all this? What's going on? You, that's what's going on. Come on, time for you to meet some women who are going to make you forget about Jillian. Looks like there's a lot of gay guys here. Yeah, everybody's having a good time. Brian, I want to introduce you to Joanna. Look out for this one, she's a bit of a card. Okay, here's one for you. What food can't make up its mind? This is going to be good. A waffle. This one. Didn't I warn you, right? Right? How are you still single? Hey there, buddy. Check it out. Check it out. I put a cruller in the Jerry's Kids' jar. - I thought that would be funny. - That is hilarious, but, Carl, I want you to hire my sister back. No, Chris, she's a pain in the ass. I-I don't want her back in here. Well, that's a shame, because I watched Event Horizon last night. No way! We have to talk about it! Yeah, well, my memory is, uh, kind of hazy. We have to talk about every scene, man! Hey, hey, hey! Remember when Jack Noseworthy's eyes explode? Wasn't that awesome?! Please agree with me that that was awesome! Well, if you hire Meg back, maybe I'll have an opinion. She's hired, she's hired! What do you think of it? - It was awesome! - Wasn't it awesome?! - It was totally awesome! - It was the most awesome thing ever! Hug me! Hey, how you doing, Brian? Lousy. I know who can cheer you up. The robot from Space Camp. Brian and Jinx are friends. Get that out of here. Okay, how about the robot from Rocky IV? Look, Stewie, get these stupid '80s movie robots out of here, and leave me alone. It's all your fault that Jillian's gone. My fault?! Brian, you've got no one to blame but yourself. You let the fat man talk you into moving out. You let Jillian walk out the door. Stop getting pushed around. Be a man. If you want her, go get her. You know something? You are absolutely right. It is time for me to take charge of my own life. Stand aside, I've got to get my girl back. Go get her, Brian. Uh, hi. Hi, Brian. What are you doing here? Jillian, look, I made a huge mistake. I don't want to lose you. You know, you really hurt me, Brian. And I can't let you do that again. Look, I won't. I promise. I don't know how to tell you this, but you're too late. I met someone else. Jillian, do you get the Oxygen Network? If I miss my Moesha, I get a bit crabby. In a minute, Adam. Well I guess this is good-bye. Please don't send me away. I have to. You broke my heart. Well, Meg, you got your job back. Actually, Chris, I don't. I really appreciate what you did for me, but I can't work for that guy anymore. He's a freak. The important thing is that you stood up for me. And I won't forget it. Oh, Brian, I know you miss Jillian, but it is good to have you back. Kind of sucks though. I mean, you are never going to find a chick that hot again. You know what the mistake was, moving in together. Well, it's just another life experience, I guess. Hey, and look on the bright side. Maybe you got another chapter for your book. Oh, yeah, pile it on, pile it on. Welcome home, douche bag!"

Hey, Peter, Lois called to remind you to pick up Meg at the roller rink. - No! - We're just getting started! Oh, Meg is my least favorite of all your children. It's all right, we'll just move the party to the skating rink. Who's sober enough to drive? Ah, okay, who's drunk, but that special kind of drunk where you're a better driver because you know you're drunk? You know, the kind of drunk where you probably shouldn't drive, but you do anyway, because, I mean, come on, you got to get your car home. Right? I mean, I mean, what do they expect me to do, take a bus? Is-is that what they want? For me to take a bus? Well, screw that. You take a bus. I'm that kind of drunk. Shotgun. Dad, where have you been? I've been waiting for over an hour. Grab some wood there, bub. Daddy and his friends have been drinking. And we're gonna keep on drinking until we each uncover repressed memories of sexual abuse by a trusted religious official. Oh, that's crazy tal Oh, my God. Minister Washington, how could you?! Man, look at all these chicks! Oh, wow. Wow. If I were a woman, I would press my bare boobs up against glass in public just for the sexual thrill! The sexual thrill! How do I stop?! Use the rubber stoppers on the front. Hey, baby, how'd you like to share a pair of skates? Sure! Never mind. Boy, you look a lot better from the back. You jerk! Oh, hey, baby, you want to go somewhere? No, no, no, no, no. Wait, wait, Quagmire, remember what's on the other side. That was awesome! Oh, my God, that was completely by accident. That was great fun. I don't even remember why we came, but I had a ball. I look forward to reminiscing about this tomorrow. Dad! Wait! You forgot me again! You need a lift? Oop, didn't answer me quick enough. Remember those sweet, warm New England summers? Remember sipping lemonade underneath a shady tree? Remember when you hit that pedestrian with your car at the crosswalk and then just drove away? Pepperidge Farm remembers. But Pepperidge Farm ain't just gonna keep it to Pepperidge Farm's self free of charge. Maybe you go outand buy yourself some of these distinctive Milano cookies, maybe this whole thing just disappears. Meg, what happened? Fat Ass and his drunk friends left me at the roller rink. You know, this wouldn't have happened if I had my own car. Meg, people have always found ways to get around without a car. Look at Iceman. Honey, where'd you go when you went out last night? Uh, just over to Tom's house. Played some poker, had some brewskis, you know. Really? Then would you mind explaining that? At least they know how to touch a man. Oh, walk away. You know, Peter, maybe Meg having her own car - isn't such a bad idea. - Yeah, I guess so. What?! I have been trying to get a sewing machine for months, but she gets a freakin' car just like that?! I hate this place. Look at all these Hummers. What kind of jerk would drive one of those? Dude, this car kicks ass! And I can watch Madagascar while I'm driving! What kind of music do you like, Gloria? Hippo-hop. Dude, those animals are so fucking funny, they make me want to merge without looking! Yeah! Rumsfeld! Hi, there, can I help you folks? Yeah, uh, my daughter's looking for a car that goes with her personality. Yes, are the new bulimic cutting mobiles in yet? This is a 1996 sedan. Excellent gas mileage, air bags and AM/FM cassette. I love it! Dad, this is the car. Eh, hang on a second, Meg. What can you tell me about this one? Oh, that's just an old tank I use for those commercials where I declare war on high prices. Now, about that sedan Hang on there, slick. Now I see your game. We come in here wanting a practical car, but then you dangle this tank in front of me and expect me to walk away. Now, I may be an idiot, but there is one thing I am not, sir, and that, sir, is an idiot. Now, I demand you tell me more about this tank. Well, if you're looking for quality, then look no further. That's more like it. Tell me, what are the tank's safety features? What a good-looking question. Three inches of reinforced steel protects your daughter from short-range missile attacks. I see. And does the sedan protect against missiles? It does not. Ah, you hear that, Meg? Yeah, it does not protect against missiles. See, these these are the questions. This is why I'm here. Peter, you can't be serious. This is a 30-ton war machine. I'm still not sure. Did I mention the tank is a tank? Sold. Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes. Boccie balls! I bought a tank! Are you out of your mind?! Let me show you how the gun works. What the hell?! No, no, no, no, no, no! Hey, Peter, can you blow that towel rack down here? Thank you. Jeff Daniels and Bill Pullman star in Neil Simon's The Even Couple. I ordered a pizza, I hope that's okay. Sure, I love pizza. This half of the apartment is mine. But if you want to come over here, that's okay, too. This isn't spaghetti, it's linguini. You're right, it is! I always get those confused. Hey, all of us are human. I'm glad we're friends. Yeah, this is really working out. There's no conflict in this movie! When are you gonna get rid of that stump?! I've been asking you for months to get rid of that stump! I'll do it, all right?! Just get off my back! She's gone. We can finally be together. But, Tim, I'm rooted to the ground. We'll find a way. We'll find a way. My God, it's hot. Brian, did you turn off the air conditioner? Just open a window. Air conditioners are harmful to the ozone layer. Brian, please. Save your hippie B.S. for the winter months, okay? Hey, Brian. I'm not gonna recycle this aluminum can. I'm just gonna throw it in the trash. Ha! you are earth's bitch! Morning, civilians. General Griffin reporting for breakfast. Dad, it's not fair. My money paid for that tank, and I haven't even gotten to drive it yet. Jeez, Meg, you always got to ruin my good time. Just like basic cable. We now return to Showgirls. - Yeah! - On TBS. Aw. All right, Meg, you got a feel for the controls. Now give it a little gas. Oh, great, it's here. That mirror I bought on eBay. Oh, my God! Joe, my God, what happened? You just ran over me, you bastard. I don't know where you got that thing, but I'm impounding it! Look at you. You look like a half-empty toothpaste. We now return to The Ghost Whisperer. I don't understand. Why do all you ghosts come to me? You're-you're really Um, you have a knack f We-we just trust you. I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson confiscate the closest thing I had to a car. Relax, Meg, it's not the worst thing I've ever done. You remember that favor I did for that park ranger? Hey, Boo Boo, let's see what we got in this pic-a-nic basket. Tell the other bears what you just saw. Well, I don't care. 'Cause you know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car. Hey, Meg, I'll pay you a dollar a day to smell my sneakers. Oh! I peed and pooped. You know, I read that they're opening a Superstore USA across town. Maybe you could get a job there. No, no, no way. You cannot work there, Meg. Giant mega-stores like Superstore USA are ruining this country. They don't pay their employees a decent wage or give them health benefits. Oh, yeah, all gay guys hate Superstore USA. - What? - Hmm? Hey, I'm just trying to be ethical. Yeah, right. You hate all megastores, ever since you were petted way too hard by that special boy in front of Kmart. Doggie! Doggie! - Doggie! - Too hard. - I like doggie! - Too hard. - Doggie! - Gonna bite. - Doggie! - Gonna bite. Doggie! Oh, Jeez. Welcome to the Superstore family, Meg. - Glad to have you. - Thanks. I'm really excited to get to work. Now, let me just go over a few basics. You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime, no health benefits, and every day at 3:00, you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth. Oh, it's nearly 3:00, now. Here you go. You're beautiful. I would go out with you if I wasn't already in a committed relationship. Hey, guys, what's going on? Oh, Peter, Superstore USA has taken all my business. Mine, too. In fact, the only guy in town making any money is that guy who makes tumbleweeds. Y'all laughed at me. Y'all laughed at me. Well, who's laughing now? What do you think of this? That makes you attractive. Yeah! Well, maybe now, you guys are seeing what I've been trying to explain to you. That mega store is a big, evil corporation that means nothing but trouble for this town. Aw, man, this is the worst thing to happen to this town since that roving gang of Tom Brokaws. Looks like someone's a little lost. Everyone, I have some bad news. Superstore USA has their own brewery on-site and can sell beer at a much cheaper price. So management has decided to close down. - You mean, I'm out of a job again? - I'm sorry, Peter. Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house. Okay, find the Easter egg. I know where it is. It's in your butt. No. Yeah, I know the story, it's in your butt. Mr. Griffin, if you'd just look on the ground for five seconds - I'm sure you'd find it. - Nope, in your butt. - Look, I'm tired of this stupid rumor. - In your butt. - Mr. Griffin. - Butt. - Mr. Griffin. - Butt. You know what, just get the hell out of here. Fine. Weirdo. So, how was work today, Meg? Oh, Peter, you lost your job because of the Superstore, you shouldn't blame Meg. And you can stop making that fart sound every time someone says ""Meg."" So, how was your day exploiting the town's resources, Meg? Meg. Meg. Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg. Meg. I'm not going to sit here and take this. I'm the only one in this family who has a job. Yeah, like she'd get paid for that. What did he just say to you? Nothing,th-there was Well, it-it's like if you were F-Forget it, it's nothing, Meg. - Hello. I'm Tom Tucker. - And I'm Diane Simmons. At the top of the news, Quahog is suffering it's worst heat wave in a century. That's right, Diane. We now go live to Ollie Williams with the Blaccu-weather report. How are you beating the heat, Ollie? - Swimmin' hole. - Thanks, Ollie. In other news, Quahog will be experiencing rolling blackouts to help meet Superstore USA's extensive power demands. Oh, in fact, Channel Five has just received this message from the Electric Company. Hey, you guys! We're gonna turn it on We're gonna bring you the power It's coming down the line, Strong as it can be, Through the courtesy The Electric Company. The Electric Company. Contrary to those upbeat lyrics, the Electric Company would like us to emphasize it will not be bringing you the power. Great, rolling blackouts. Now, Superstore USA is siphoning off all the city's power. And they cost me my job. Mine, too. Superstore USA has their own paper route. That new paper boy done gone and broke my sternum. Ah, this sucks. That damn Superstore's ruining everything. You know, instead of sitting around complaining, why don't we go down there and protest? That's a great idea, Brian. All we need is some magic markers, posterboard, some plywood Actually, Superstore USA has all that stuff. We can just get it there. There's one of them now. Take that for stealing jobs from hardworking people. Dad, what the hell are you doing? We got a message for you. We're here, we're queer, get used to it. - Uh, actually, Peter - Gattaca, Gattaca! Peter, I don't think it's working. People are still going into the store. Well, fine, then I guess I got to go in there and drag 'em out one by one. All right, who the hell is in charge Ah ah, wha-what is that I'm feeling? That's our industrialsized air conditioner. Wow. When I walk into Superstore USA, I get the sensation that I'm standing on a mountain top with the wind blowing through my hair. My God, look at this wonderland of treasures. What would a guy like me have to do to be part of this magical world? You are trespassing on private property and I must ask you to leave. What? Are you out of your mind? Leave this lot, losers. Unless you want a licking. And we'd love to deliver that licking, right, fellas? - Yeah. Love it. - A lot. I'd love to lick a lemon lollipop in Lillehammer. God, I wish the power would come back on. Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward to this job. Peter, I can't believe you're working for Superstore USA. How could you sell out like that? Because, Brian, they have an industrialsized air conditioner. And I'm tired of sitting in balls soup. Look, Dad, this isn't going to be a cakewalk, all right? I'm your supervisor. Meg, Meg, I promise I'll do better at this job than I did on the SAT's. Come on. Do math. Dad, I need you to Dad, what are you doing? Meg, Meg, look, Meg look. I am so freaking good at coloring. I know I'm not supposed to go outside the lines, but I do anyway because I like being myself. Dad? Dad? Dad? Oh, God, it's so hot. Uh, Brian, spit on me. Oh, that's nice. Now, tell me I'm scum. - How will that cool you off? - Hmm? God, it's awful in here. This is even worse than getting herpes from a toilet seat. Joanie, it's me. Oh, hey. You know, I had such a great time with you last night. Listen, there's something I have to tell you. I just got back from the doctor. I have herpes. I think you should get yourself checked out. - Oh, my God. - Will you stay? What? Will you stay with me, even knowing that I have herpes? Yes, I will. - Joanie? - Yeah? I don't have herpes. I just needed to know that you'd stay. You say I only hear what I want to I've had it, the only place in town that's got power is Superstore USA, while the rest of us are left to bake in the heat. There's got to be something we can do to take that place down. Don't worry, Brian, I think I've got an idea. Oh, yeah. Excuse me, can you tell me where I can find a assault rifles? Aisle 6. How about a list of known local homosexuals? Aisle 4. Meg, you're doing a great job. In fact, I'm promoting you to assistant manager. Really? Oh, my God. Thank you so much. Now, your first responsibility is to fire that employee. Boy, I'm a little chilly. I hope no one notices. But that's my dad. What's more important to you, your job or your family? And don't pick the obvious one. Oh, hey, guys, I was just catching up on some plunger nipples. Dad, um Go on, Meg. What are you waiting for? Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this, but you're a fat ass who's completely incapable of performing the simplest tasks. But you're also my father. And you're the only one I'll ever have. So, I'm not going to fire you. Mr. Penisberg, I quit. Penisberg? Yeah, yeah, get it all out of your system. Meg, that was a wonderful thing you just did for me. I can't believe this is coming out of my mouth, but I love y So, you got a tank. Big whoop. Want to fight about i Huh, well, I'm glad that Superstore USA is gone. That place was nothing but trouble. And I think we learned something. Any problem caused by a tank can be solved by a tank. Dad, you were about to say something in the store. No, I don't think so. No, I'm sure of it. Oh, I don't know, something about Hardcastle and McCormick? No, you were going to say you loved me. You love me and you know it. Hey, hey, mouth, young lady. Well, you think you'll look for another job, Meg? Meg! Meg. Meg. Uh-oh. Pardon me."

                    			Family Guy - Episode S06E04 Saving Private Brian All right, kids, assembly is starting. Now please take your seats for the following presentation by the U.S. Army. - What's up, y'all? I'm Sergeant Extreme! - And I'm Major Awesome! We're here to tell you how much the army kicks ass! Check this out! The army sounds awesome! And the recruiter said with any luck, I could get the clap from a 12-year-old Chinese prostitute. Wow, that's great. You'll be serving your country, just like American film legend Mickey Rooney. Hi. I'm former biggest star in the world, Mickey Rooney. And as you may know, I am totally and completely insane. I like to yell at mice with my shirt off. Sometimes I like to steal other people's scabs. How do I stay so crazy? Mickey Rooney's Crazy Pills! Take one with breakfast, one with lunch, and before you know it, you'll be up on your roof; pooping in the chimney. Hold out your stockings, kids! Chris, you can't join the army, you're too young. Besides, the army is weak. Now, the marines, those are the men you want to (beep). Are you kidding, Lois? The army's great! You get to save money for college, there's free food, and all the brown people you can rape. I am sorry, but he is not joining the army. Case closed. I can't believe they're brainwashing kids like Chris to serve in the military. Ah, yes, the bottom ten percent of our high school class is off to fight another battle. - You stole that from The Onion. - What? I read that in The Onion. About the war in Iraq. Well, if that's true, then I'd say they've got some sharp cookies over at the, uh Wh-What is it again? The Onion? So if I go up to your room right now, I'm not gonna find a copy of The Onion, right? No. - Ow! Damn it! - That's what I thought. Coming this fall, if you loved Everybody Loves Raymond, then you'll love his brother, Robert, even more, in Robert. I bet you Debra really gave it to Ray today. I bet you she made a sandwich that wasn't very good, but he ate it anyway. And then she got mad at him 'cause he gave her a funny look. I miss Ray. I can't believe Chris would just buy into that army recruiter's sales pitch. We can't let him enlist. Don't worry, Lois, all he needs is an after-school activity to get his mind off the army. Just something to distract him. You know, like all of America gets distracted whenever a cute white girl dies. We regret to report that not all the children onboard the school bus survived. We have identified the body of one victim, nine-year-old Becky Gunderson. No, wait, that's, uh, Becky Gutierrez. That's not news. B-Brian, wha what are you doing? Gymboree is that way. Brian, it's parachute day! I just want to swing by the army recruiting center and give a piece of my mind to that jerk who tried to brainwash Chris. We are gonna be so late. I'm not gonna have a partner. I'm gonna have to be partners with the teacher. It's just wrong for the military to mess with kids' minds. They're all gonna wind up in therapy, like Peter was. Every time my daughter opens her mouth, I just want to punch her in the face. She's really annoying. Uh-huh. All right, let's explore that. What the hell's wrong with you? Your skin's, like, moving around or something. I believe I'm having some sort of seizure. What kind of after-school activity should I do, Dad? Well, Chris, there's a lot of fun activities out there. For example, I used to be a horse whisperer. Pfft, maybe if she spent some time on the treadmill and I was drunk. I wouldn't, either. I don't think any of this stuff is right for me, Dad. Let's just face it I suck! Sounds like you guys could use some fresh blood. This is my son, Chris. You should hear his voice. It's absolutely gorgeous. Like Laura Dern if she didn't look like a banana. He can sing? Yeah, runs in the family. See, look. I am Peter Griffin, I like fancy food I like reading comic books and dressing like a dude. Yeah, rock and roll! Did you hear that? Guys, I think we just found our new lead singer. Awesome! I'm gonna be a famous music star, like Muddy Waters! Muddy? Baby? Everything all right in there? Oh, I think I'm about to pass a kidney stone. Boy, I can't wait to lay into that recruiter. Yes, you'll be about as effective as the Wizard of Oz was at granting wishes. And, Dorothy, you wanted herpes, but little did you know, you've had herpes all along. I didn't want herpes! Well you've got it. Yes, uh, I'd like to see the army recruiter. Oh, you'll have to have a seat. There's a 25-minute wait. Oh, God. All right, I better go put more money in the meter. Peggy, would you send in the next Oh, you're already here. Say, aren't you a little young to join the army? No, I have that, uh Webster disease. Hey, is that the M9 double-action pistol? Sure is. Standard issue in the army. - Where do I sign? - Right here. Did I mention there's a hundred-dollar bonus if you sign up a buddy? Really? Well, I think I have a surprise for somebody. There you are. Congratulations, you are both in the army. We're bothin What? That's ridiculous. I'll tell you what's ridiculous : the Kaiser. Somebody should put him on a roll. Over, we're comin' over And we won't come back till it's over over there. C ommercial! Damn! Play me some filler, Johnny. Okay, they're dead, all right? We're not gonna be seeing them again. My God! You are the sorriest bunch of rejects I ever seen. And I've seen the Bangles in concert. You! Where are you from, boy? - Quahog. - They only got two things in Quahog : steers and queers. I don't see no horns on you. What does that make you, boy? - Queer? - Right! - Oh, I got it? - Yeah. You find something funny, Private Dancer? Dancer for money?! Any old music will do?! Well, actually, yeah, your last little, uh, back-and-forth there with Stewie, that whole queer thing, that was actually pretty funny. Oh, God! Ooh, that's got to hurt worse than getting a birthday telegram from Zinedine Zidane. Yes? Bon anniversaire. Yo, yo, what's up, James Woods High?! I'm Chris, and this is our band, Splash Log! And we are gonna rock this place until un well, until about 9:30, 'cause that's when the dance is over! Evil monkey holds the key Evil Monkey's gonna get me I'm hiding underneath my seat for fear he'll point and show his teeth! Evil, evil monkey! Evil, evil monkey! Evil, evil monkey! Mayor West? Quiet, young man. Can't you see we're having a poker game? Now, I'll ask again. If I order a pizza, will anyone else have some? I might have a slice. Well, you know, I'm gonna need more of a commitment than that, Mark. West Side Story, Anything Goes. West Side Story, Anything Goes. Two of my favorite Broadway shows. Two of my favorite Broadway shows. Miss Saigon and Cabaret. Miss Saigon and Cabaret. Overrated, I should say. Overrated, I should say. One, two, three, four. Mambo! Griffin! You got four legs there! You better start using them! I'm trying, sir. You got five seconds to get to the head of the pack, or this entire platoon is gonna scrub the latrines with their toothbrushes. - Aw, come on, Brian! - Don't screw us, Griffin! - Yeah, come on, - don't screw us, Brian Griffin! Bill, how about thinking up your own jeers for a change, huh? Four! Three! Two! - Oh, come on, Brian, get up! - Time's up! You're pathetic, Griffin! Pathetic! Whose half-eaten dead bird is in this footlocker? Let's say hypothetically that it does belong to someone in here. Would admission of that allow that person to keep it? Private Griffin, just for that, you have to listen to one track from this Chris Gaines album. - Don't you think that's a little extreme? - Two tracks! It's so stupid, it's just Garth Brooks in a wig. - Three tracks! - Come on! - We can go all day with this! - Yeah, but That's it! Every single track, plus the hidden bonus track! There's a hidden bonus track? Oh, I hope it's a ballad. Huh. Should I follow the knight into the dungeon or should I go back the way I came? Eh, I'll follow the knight. Page 37, page 37. Aah! Aah! I mean, go back the way I came. I didn't take my hand off the page. You seen it, Lois, right? You seen my hand on the page. Yeah, Peter, I seen it. Oh, no, not again. You know, I'm glad Chris found an activity he likes, but why do they have to use our garage? Come on, Lois, sometimes kids can be a handful. Look at Gregory Peck's kids. - Are we there yet? - It's crowded back here. - Stop touching me. - Your leg is rubbing up against mine. Hey! Quiet down or I'm pulling over. - Stop breathing on the window. - You idiot. That's condensation. It's on the outside. That's it! I will come back there and, so help me God, I will hit you with my ring hand. What the hell are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I'm leaving. You can't leave, man. That's desertion. They'll come after you like Peter went after that hockey coach. Oh, no clip? Oh, thought we had a clip. Nope. Okay. Uh, you can't leave, Brian. - You'll get life in prison. - I'll take my chances. Let me ask you this : when was the last time you saw something through to the end? - Well, I, uh - Never, that's when! You need this, Brian. You dropped out of college. You still haven't finished your novel. Do you know what you lack? Discipline! And so you know where you'll get it? Right here in the army! Boy, you know what, you're right. Everything I've ever done I've crapped out on halfway through. Well, not this time. I am going to finish what I started. That's the spirit! You can do anything you put your mind to. You know, it's really hard to masturbate with you guys talking. Not for me! Evil, evil monkey! Ow! Chris, will you knock that off for 2 minutes? We want to talk to you. Take five, guys. What do you buttheads want? You've been playing with your friends long enough. Now it's time for you to come inside and do your homework. It's time for you to piss off, redhead. What?! Hey, hey, Chris, don't talk to your mother that way. Oh, way to stand up for your woman there, fatty. Chris, what the hell is going on with you lately? Ever since you hooked up with this band, you're like a completely different person, and I don't like it one bit. I am expressing myself! Now, get out of my way! I'm going to the park to loiter. - What the hell is his problem? - I don't know. He's acting worse than you did when you tried to cover your farts by coughing. Okay, welcome to the PTA meeting. On the subject of school lunches, I know there's been some concern about nutrition We've had complaints about the soda machines And I have spoken with the school board Is there something you'd like to say, Mr. Griffin? Uh Noooo No. No, I'm good. All right, men. This obstacle course represents the final test of your training. Almost all of you have completed it in the allotted time. But as you know, as a unit, you either all graduate, or none of you graduate. Griffin, it's up to you. All right, you can do this, Brian. Come on, pray with me. Dear Lord just stay out of our way. Okay, good luck. And go! There's Waldo. - Fresh pepper? - Yes, thank you. - Oh, that's plenty, thanks. - None for me, thanks. My boyfriend just dumped me. There's a lot of fish in the sea. It's always darkest before the dawn. If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be. Thanks! You did it, Brian! You did it! Oh, I say, this is an even bigger accomplishment than getting Minnie Driver's head to fit on screen. Okay, back up. Further. - Move back some more. - What?! Back up some more. I'm as far away as I can get. Okay, have her enter. Action! Damn it. Cut! Congratulations, men. You've all passed basic training. I'm proud to call you soldiers. I'm sure you'll do your country proud tomorrow morning, when you're all shipped off to Iraq. What? Oh, don't worry. I'm sure he means Fraggle Iraq. - Well, this isn't so bad. - Yes, the people are friendly. I say, the media has totally blown this whole thing out of proportion. Okay, I go in store, I throw backpack. Big boom. No, no, no, you are big boom. Big hero. Okay, right, so I throw backpack, come back and have big hero party with many virgins. No, no, no, no, no. You : boom. Oh, okay, okay. I put on backpack, boom. Then I come back, big hero, virgins. Okay, yeah. See you in a few minutes, big hero. Unit 17, this is base. Please report. Ten-four, everything's Charlie 40-60. What does that mean? I don't know. I just thought you're supposed to say names and numbers. Nobody's corrected me so far. What the hell was that?! Uh, help! Help! Uh, uh, I mean, ah, ah, Charlie, Tango, Cash, uh, 47, Victor, Charlie, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman! Roger that. We're moving to your position. Chris, your father and I are very upset by this new attitude of yours. I don't care what you think of me! Oh, God, I envy that. I am so self-conscious about what people think of me. I am out of here! You know, I think I may have an idea what's causing this behavior, Peter. Look at all this stuff. Listen to these lyrics. ""I rip it hardcore like porno-flick bitches."" ""I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits."" Oh, look, they've got a translation for white people : ""I give 110 percent when it comes to helping my community,"" ""even though I occasionally associate with some less than reputable characters."" Peter, these lyrics are filthy. All this violent music is what's screwing Chris up. What the hell? Marilyn Manson! Is that who's causing all this? Yeah, it's all him or her's fault. Who does he or she think he or she is? Look, you can totally see his or her nipples. - That's obscene, maybe. - There's only one thing to do. You're right, we got to find this Marilyn Manson and I got to give that bastard or bitch a piece of my mind or penis. All right, it shouldn't be too hard to get ourselves kicked out. Right. We're just got to convince them we're not army material. - Ready? - All right, let's do it. Wow, look at how gay we are. I am so gay, with my gayness. Me, too.I'm I'm a homo. - Any room for one more? - Hell yeah! All right, last resort. We get injured and go home with purple hearts. Shoot me in the foot. What? Shoot yourself in the foot. No, no, no, they can tell by the angle. Here, you shoot me and I'll shoot you. I don't think this is gonna work. Of course it'll work. Ready? One two three! Damn it! Oh, my God! That hurts! - I think you missed me. - All right, I'll try again. Uh, no, no, no, hang, hang on. That looks like it's painful. Of course it's painful! There's a bullet in my foot! Now get over here! No, no, no, no, no! I changed my mind! - I don't want to do it! - Come on, we had a deal! No, no, no, no, don't point that at me! No, no, no, oh, come on, this is flat out just not safe! Oh, you got me. Ow. Ow. Ow. - Let me see. - No, no, it's gross. - Let me see it. - No, no, I don't want to gross you out. Oh, ow, oh, we are in so much pain right now, the two of us. Oh, ow Okay, that was real! Hey, hi, um, I'm Private Stewie and this is Private Brian. Uh, we both got shot in the foot, so, uh, we figured an honorable discharge would be in order and, uh, you could just send us back to the States. Getting shot doesn't get you out of here anymore. What? Yeah, we take whatever we can get. I mean, we got two dead guys guarding the ammunition. Sorry, guys, you are here until the job is done. Great news, everybody. Democracy just kicked in! So it's over? That seems unlikely. Amazing. There was only one man in the world with the vision to predict something like this. Damn. Laura! Laura! Laura! And the Grammy for Biggest Posse goes to Ja Rule. What?! No, Madonna. ""Posse."" ""Posse."" Oh. All right, Marilyn Manson has to be here somewhere. Good thing we distracted the guard with that riddle. What gets wetter as it dries? A towel. Hey, I've been had! Hey, look, right over there. Hey, Manson! What in the world was that for? - Oh, it's a guy. - That's for ruining our son. He used to be a sweet boy until he heard your music. This old story. If I had a nickel All right, where's your son? I'm hiding underneath my seats for fear he'll point and show his teeth! Chris? We brought someone you might like to meet. Oh, my God, Marilyn Manson! Hey there, Chris. You working hard or hardly working? - So I see you're in a band. - Yep. Listen, your parents tell me you've been acting out a little bit. And I just wanted to tell you, rock n' roll music is cool, but respect for your elders is a tune we can all dance to. - Really? - Sure. And the best way to start a fun-filled day of being a good citizen is with a healthy breakfast rich in breads and grains. And fruits are important, too. You mean like apples, oranges and bananas? Any of 'em, Chris. You can't miss. And now, I think your parents have something to say. Chris, you don't really believe all the things in those song lyrics, do you? No. Then why you been acting like such a punk? I guess I don't really know. I think I have an idea. Peter, when was the last time you and Chris here did something together? Boy, I guess it's been a while. Here's something you might not know : Children crave structure. They enjoy the fun of planned activities in which they and their parent or guardian can share a common goal. Maybe you could take Chris fishing. What do you say, Chris? You want to go fishing with your old man? Do I? Can't go without these."

They had one on last night where the girl had a buttface but her breasts was immaculate. Peter, you sure it's okay to beat the brewery after hours? Relax, Joe, this is where I work.

If she's as ugly as I think she is, I'll look at her once and then I'll go .all over the place Then you'll wipe it up and then we'll go. Hi, Brian. Oh, my God. Who's your cute little friend? Oh, my. Hello. Stewie. Charmed. I'm Jillian. Come on in. Who wants a drink? So, you gonna take back what you said? Brian, she's stunning. Okay, you met her, you can scram now. I shall do no such thing. Now, why in the world would you be embarrassed about dating her? Oh, my God, Brian. I was watching something on TV about this guy named Hitler. Somebody should stop him. Are her parents brother and sister? Can you please leave now? Oh now I get it. She's a moron. But a moron with large breasts you can use as mountains for your Matchbox cars, or whatever it is grown-ups do with large breasts. Shut up, that's not it at all. Say, Jillian, I love what you've done with the place. What is it? One bedroom, one bath? No, it's a whole apartment. Oh, God, outstanding. So, Stewie. Do you work with Brian at the detective agency? Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I do. At the detective agency. That's got to be a tough job. I know Brian's work has him coming and going at all hours of the night. I bet it does, I bet it does. Okay, well, Stewie has to go now. What are you talking about? I want some more of Jillian's delicious lemonade. I know, it's good, right? I just wish they didn't have to kill so many lemons to make it. Oh, this is fun, eh? So, wait, Dupree moves in with Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon? But they're newlyweds, right? Well, that's no time to have a houseguest. Oh, gotta go. Sorry, Angela. Every Tuesday morning, I call my friend Cleveland and he describes every scene from You, Me, and Dupree. Griffin, your workout put this week is even worse than usual. Where the hell are those purchase orders? Eh, it's this bum hand. I can't type with it. Well, that's not my problem. I need to see some improvement by the end of the week or you're finished. Don't worry, I'll figure something out. Oh, that's going to be Quagmire with Along Came Polly. I gotta take that. All right, so as you know by this point in the story, Ben Stiller doesn't like spicy food. Well, guess what's for dinner? No way. Boy, Lois, thanks so much for coming in and helping me get my work done. Without you, Angela would have been all over my case. Oh, it's all right, Peter. I know it's tough for you to work with your hand injury. Hey, you know, uh, with you sitting there, it's, uh, it's kind of like you're my secretary. Let's not get carried away, Peter. Now, please, I'm trying to finish your work. You know, Lois, if I'm your boss, I gotta look like a boss. Finally, I have a reason to wear this big bow tie and cigar I bought at the Dress For Success store. Peter, if you want this work to get done Lois, take a letter. ""Dear Life Cereal,"" ""Where do you get off?"" ""Part of a balanced breakfast and delicious?"" ""Who do you think you are?"" ""By now, you may have guessed I'm speaking ironically"" ""and have nothing but good things to say about what you do."" ""Life Cereal, do not change a thing."" ""Signed, Peter Griffin. Dictated but not read."" Lois, read that back to me. Oh, hey, Brian. Back from a hot booty call with your idiot girlfriend? You know, think what you want, but you don't see the side of Jillian that I do. Face it, Brian, she's dumber than a Boston-area book report. The novel I chose to address is Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens. Queer name, right? The book was actually not bad. For your information, Jillian is very bright and she happens to be a very talented photographer. Oh, that is so lame. Every hot girl who can aim a camera thinks she's a photographer. Ooh, you took a black and white picture of a lawn chair and its shadow and developed it at Sav-On. You must be so brooding and deep. - Knock it off. - No, I want to know, Brian. What, specifically, do you talk about? Uh, a lot of things. Um food, um the new seat covers she just got for her Jetta. Um - Real World / Road Rules Challenge. - You hate MTV. Pot helps. Look, you know, I don't have to justify anything to you, all right? All that matters is Jillian and I have a great time together. - We make each other laugh. - Fine. But just tell me this, Brian : does she laugh on her own or does she laugh only when you laugh? I thought so. Hey. Yeah. Uh-huh uh-huh. Uh, you gotta hit, uh, DVD and then menu and then select. Yeah. Yeah, the DVD needs to be face up when you put it in. Uh-huh. You should be able to see the words Mr. 3000. Yeah still nothing? Is it plugged in? Okay, so plug it in. Okay. Y-You got it? Is it uh, okay. All right. No, no problem. All right. Uh, love you, too, Jilly bean. Okay. - What? - Nothing. I didn't say anything. I need a drink. Uh, hey, uh, Jilly bean? Hey, it's Brian again. Uh, so, yeah, um so I figured we could get together tonight and maybe, um, do all those things sexually that we usually do. Um, what were those again? No way, gross! Oh, I mean, I mean, oh, oh, no. Yeah, I totally love how that feels. Hi. You know, I've been noticing you around the steno pool. You look good enough for a promotion. Peter, cut it out. Hey, that's no way to talk to your boss. Mmm, is that Pert? You know it is. Smell my Speed Stick? Peter, what the hell are you doing? Lois, I'm gonna come right out with it. I think it would be so hot for you and me to have sex in my office. Oh, my God. There is no way that is gonna happen. You know, it's no wonder you're so far behind in your work if this is how you behave at the office. Come on, just touch it. Touch yours. Peter, no. I have work to do so you can keep your job. Oh, look at me, I'm Lois. I'm a worker. I make stuff on things. Oh, I'll file these later. Oh, I got a phone. Nope, that's it. Geez, Lois, I thought having you here was gonna be fun, but so far you're a bigger buzzkill than Buzz Killington. Oh, man, this is the best party I've ever been to. Evening, everyone. I thought it would be very droll if we all sat down and looked at etchings. Would you like to join me, Peter? Uh, well, we-we're kinda partying here. Good! Hold this up. Now here's a fellow attempting to ride a bicycle. But he's having some trouble, isn't he? Would you like to know why? Why? Because he's a Scot! Now, who here likes a good story about a bridge? What the hell? Jillian, what - What are you doing here? - Oh, hi, Brian. It was so nice of you to invite your girlfriend over for dinner. - I invited her for dinner? - Yes, you did. You wanted her to meet the family. Now, come here, Brian. Come sit by your friend, Stewie. And then, think about this : have you ever seen the sun and the moon in the same place at the same time? They're the same person! - I know, right?! - You're brilliant! Hey, Oogie! So tell us, Oogie, where'd you find this one, huh? You two meet at a Mensa meeting? No, at a Quizno's. We both ordered the Turkey Ranchand Swiss, no onions. Can you believe that? No, wow. What are the odds? Well, hey, what are the odds of finding true love anywhere in the world says this observer. Hey, you wanna know something cool? I threw up a lot in high school, so I don't get my period anymore. Wow, this is the one you've been waiting for, huh, Brian? Are you serious? Are you serious, Brian? All right, you know what, Lois, don't judge. Because you don't know what two people are like when they're alone. Come on. Let's go out dancing. I don't know, I'm feeling kinda cozy tonight. Kinda mellow. I just really want to go dancing Oh! There it is again! What is that? So, Jillian, what are your views regarding homeland security? Do you think we should support what the president is doing? Well, I just think, for starters, that sometimes the government has things they can't tell us and, truthishly, we should just accept that. Okay, goodnight, everyone. Oh, say, Jillian, before you go. I forget. Do you know what the capital of this state is? Um Rhode Island City? It's like she's (bleep) five! Thanks for hanging out with my friends, Brian. Hey, come on. We're-we're a legitimate couple, right? I-I should be able to talk with your friends. So then the valet pulls up and I'm all, ""That is so not my car."" But then it totally was. - That's happened to me! - Me, too. Cars go fast. Oh, God. Yeah, I tell ya, if I had a nickel for every time that happened. - Yeah? - What? What if you had a nickel for every time that happened? No, nothing. It's just an expression. A what? Well, I was just saying I do my share of dopey stuff. Like, oh, this this one time I attended a speaker's colloquium on federal judgeships and without realizing it, I kept calling William Rehnquist ""William Rhinequist."" Come on. I mean, how ""doi."" Anyone else have to go to the littlegirls' room? I have new gloss! - I love gloss! - Oh, that rocks! Gloss rhymes with hair! Dude, that was painful. What are you doing here? Did you follow us? Brian, why can't you just admit what's going on here? Okay, okay. Fine. Fine. I'm gonna have to break it off. But, boy, it's gonna be tougher than the reviews for Our American Cousin. Blah, blah, blah, ""Lincoln assassinated,"" blah, blah, blah, ""tragedy for our Republic."" Uh oh, look! ""Ably performed by the entire ensemble."" That's us! That's all of us! Morning, Lois, I need you to proof read this and collate it for me. Peter, did you Xerox your penis? Flip through it or you're fired. Oh, my God! This is disgusting. Peter, for the last time, I'm not having sex with you in this office. Why the hell are you pushing this so hard? Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter to ""Penthouse Forum,"" and I don't wanna be made a liar in the nudie magazine of record. All right. If I give you 30 seconds of making out, will that shut you up? Let's see where it goes. Oh, God, you know this is pretty hot. Yeah, what'd I tell you, huh? Oh, God, Peter, let's do it. Let's do it right here, right now! Lois, Lois wait. Wait. Opie's right there. I want him to look, Peter. Well, that is the last of it. You are now all caught up with your work. Lois, I really appreciate you helping me out this week, and I really appreciate you having sex with me in my office. Well, that was my pleasure, too, Peter. Haa, I knew I'd get you. Just like Danny DeVito got Rhea Perlman. I don't know, Danny. Look, it's either me or nobody. Sold. All right, Brian, you can do this. You can dump her. Because once it's done, never again will you have to listen to her talk like this? You know, where everything has a question mark at the end of it? With an upward inflection? At the end of every sentence? Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking? Oh, damn it. Now I'm doing it, too. Oh, hey, Oogie. Ooh, you look tense. Well, uh, Jillian, there's something we need to talk about. What is it? I, uh just wanted to spend some time with you. What the hell? It took you three hours to break up with her? Uh, not exactly. Well, what were you doing in there? What's that smell? It smells like sweat and anger and shame. Yep. Life's confusing when you grow up, isn't it, Brian? It is. - Can we play my mix tape? - Yeah, go ahead. Brian had sex with a really dumb girl Now he's taking his friend Stewie To get some ice cream in his car Oh, you're a poor sport."

                    			Family Guy - Episode S06E06 Prick Up Your Ears We now return to Rodney King of Queens. - Rodney, did you take out the trash? - Um, I forgot. Oh, no she di-in't. Pizza for Adam West. No. You gave me Canadian bacon instead of bacon? This misdeed cannot go unpunished. Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your maker at the hands of my cat launcher. Hey, look, somebody tried to break into the dirty movie store. Quick, grab as many as you can before someone sees us. Damn, I lost him. All right, cats, back in the bag. Come on, Fluffy. Come on, Mittens. Come on, Paul. What a ridiculous name for a cat. Paul! That's a person's name. A person's name. Oh, Paul. Oh, man, this is going to be great. - Oh, are we watching a movie? - The lab results are back. You've tested positive for nymphomania. Oh, no, what should I do? Take two of these and call us in the morning. Oh, now that's not going to help her nymphomania. It's only going to exacerbate it. Oh, my God, what are you kids doing? Out. Everybody out. That's bogus. - Chris, what is this? - Genital Hospital. Yes, and it's inappropriate for someone your age. Now, if you're curious about sex, you should talk to your sex ed teacher. We don't have one. The principal cut sex ed class to save money. What? Well, that's crazy. Without sex ed, kids can wind up sexually confused. Just look at Michael Jackson. The kid in me likes the frosted side but the grown-up in me likes the kid in me. Peter, do you know they're not teaching sex ed at Chris' school? Eh, let them figure it out the way I had to. With a can of Crisco and a shot glass. That's the natural way, Lois. That's the natural way. Well, somebody's got to step in. Tomorrow, I'm going down to James Woods High and offer to teach the class myself. Hey, you could really make a difference. Like I did when I taught money management to those drug addicts. There's a lot of ways for you guys to save money. For example, you're all shooting up, why not share needles? That's a no-brainer. More money in your wallet, more drugs in your veins. My second piece of advice : have as many kids as you can, 'cause that makes it more likely that one of those kids'll grow up and make it big in Hollywood. Then who's paying the bills, eh? Hollywood kid. Class dismissed. Good morning, everyone. I'm Mrs. Griffin, your new sex ed teacher. Now, you've probably heard all those rumors that condoms make sex less pleasurable. While that is a fact, they also make sex safer. Sorry I'm late, Lois. Peter, what are you doing here? Lois, you think I'm going to miss a chance to share my knowledge with these fresh young minds? Forget it, I've missed too many other opportunities. - There he is. - Took you long enough. - Just what we need. - Hey, guys, I'm coming in. - Oh, God. - Oh, God. Oh, boy. I am not going to hear the end of this. - You jackass. - Now you've done it. Idiot. I know I don't fit here, but I'm just going to settle right in. All right, Peter, you can stay, but remember, this is my class. Now, there are a number of natural ways that males and females interact. That's right, allow me to demonstrate. Hey, Rainbow Brite. Hello, Shakespeare. I am all done writing plays for the day, perhaps we could have sexual intercourse? Count me in. I say, look at this. This toy has small parts. Why the devil would they include small parts? Unless I'm supposed to eat them. Of course, it all adds up! Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth. Dude, you're lucky. If you put that under your pillow, the Tooth Fairy will come and give you a dollar. What? Did you say the Tooth Fairy comes here? To our house? She just breaks in like some hood? Yeah, she creeps into your house at night and comes into your room while you sleep. Oh, my God! And sometimes, just for the hell of it, she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair and places it gently on your tongue. Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here! Stewie, calm down. Get a hold of yourself. Here, Brian, let me handle this. Calm down. Everything's going to be all right. Chris, you're wanted on the phone. Everything's going to be all right. Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly for the class today, but they were all out so I got Smucker's. Peter, I don't know what you think you're doing, but you ruined my sex ed class. There's no way you're coming with me again. Fine, but without my advice, those kids are going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson when he tries to play an American cowboy. But, Montana, when will you be back? That's none of your concern. You got to take care of the offspring. Gonna take a fortnight at least to get this herd down to St. Louis on Mississippi. This glen's gonna be tough to traverse, and that river's got to be 50, And God knows how many fathoms. To hell with parliamentary procedure. We've got to wrangle up some cattles. What is going on here? We're all protesting the sex ed class that's being taught to our children. Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the school board has voted to cancel your sex ed class. Look, Principal Shepherd, I know my husband acted inappropriately Oh, it's not because of your husband. It's because you're teaching those kids about condoms. What? That's ridiculous. These students have the right to information about safe sex. Well, these parents don't think so. I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin. You're fired. Fired?! Oh, no. I can't believe they fired you. Can't you go down the school and try to reason with them? No, I'm banned from school property. The PTA doesn't want me around their children. Well, Lois, I think you did the right thing by trying to inform these kids about safe sex. And if the parents don't like it, that's their loss. That's the problem, though. It isn't their loss, it's the kids' loss. I just hope they're getting the information they need. All right, students, we have a special speaker today who's going to educate you about sex. Please welcome from the First Evangelical Church, the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood and the Opal Ring Crusade. Hey, kids, put your Walkmans down and listen up. 'Cause we're going to talk about sex. Sex? Hang on there, Jerry. God, what are you doing here? I was just passing through on my way to see The Matrix. - We can relate to that. - No fake. Well, God, I am here to talk to these kids about sex. Uh-oh. And why they shouldn't be having it. That is boss. Hey, you kids like Mad TV? Well, we've got something almost as good. Here they are The Opal Ring Players. Boy, I sure had fun at the pizza parlor tonight, Debbie. Yeah, Matthew, that pizza pie was delicious. Hey, watch out, crazy driver. That joker must have been from Jefferson High. They're our rivals. Well, here we are at the make-out point. Yeah. You want to go all the way? Freeze! Now, who can tell me what Matthew just did wrong? I mean, besides not running over that yahoo from Jefferson High. They're our rivals. He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex and he's not married. - Bingo. - Wow, you're pretty smart. - Thanks. My name's Doug. - I'm Meg. Now, look, let's rap for a second. He's sitting informally like us. Let's hear what he has to say. Jefferson High is our rival. Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it before you're married, even if you use a condom. Because not only to condoms fail they're also majorly unsafe. Hey, you wouldn't put a plastic bag over your grandmother's head, would you? No. And that's why we're gonna be handing out these opal rings. These rings are a symbol of your commitment to refrain from sex until you're married. So what do you say? Who wants to be joyful? Who wants to be pure? Who wants to be abstinent? - Wow, he makes so much sense. - I know, he's a visionary, like Gandhi or Mozart or Picasso. Ladies and gentlemen, my newest work. Now, I know this person looks a little mixed up, but, watch carefully. If I move this down here, and this over here, and this part here Anyone tell who it is yet? No? Okay, well, what if I move this here and this here Then it's Dianne Wiest. All right, men, your mission tonight is to stave off the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy. SpongeBob, you watch the East. StarScream, you take the West. And Man-E-Faces, you take center patrol since you have many faces. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. It's morning. Is it? Ha! I knew it! I scared her off. Uh, you might want to check under your pillow. How did she get in? She must have been quieter than Britney Spears' dietician. Ea-Easy on those trans fats. N-Not everything needs gravy. You know, there's some carrots down at the other end. That-that cheesecake was for everyone. Her hand was right beneath my pillow. She could have snapped my neck if she had a mind to. Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be a while before you lose another tooth. I can't wait for that. I have to lure her back on my terms and kill her myself! But to catch a fairy, I have to think like a fairy. If you want Brian to say : ""Well, that'll be a stretch,"" text-message FAMGUY1. If you want Brian to say : ""I'm not touching that one,"" text FAMGUY2. If you want Brian to say : ""Arriba!"" and dance around a sombrero, text FAMGUY3. Enter now. Thanks for voting. Arriba! We now return to Laguna Beach. - Like, right? - I know. - Whatever, because ""duh!"" - I know, right? Whatever, because I mean, like, totally full out. - Full on. - Right? I guess it's not easy growing up anywhere. Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring. It means I made a pledge not to have sex. That's crazy! You can't give up sex. You've got a responsibility. You see, Meg, you're what they call a ""practice girl."" Dad, look at the facts about sex. ""If you have sex, your penis will fall off and land in another dimension"" ""populated entirely by dogs who will eat it."" Well, that's something I'd like to avoid. Well, this changes everything. From now on, I, too, will be obstinate. - Abstinent. - Absinthe. - Abstinent. - You're grounded. All right, getting a tooth to lure that damn fairy back shouldn't be too difficult. I'd love to dance, Fred Savage. Gosh, Meg, I really wish we could take our relationship to the next level. I know, I feel the same way, but we made a decision to be abstinent. Of course, there are ways we could keep our pledge and still do other things. You're right. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Uh-huh. Oh, there it is. I see it. You know, Roy, I hope you play squash better than you pass. Well, we'll find out this Saturday. All right, Peter, you ready for role-playing night? Here comes, Grimace. You got some burgers I can steal, huh? Lois, the Hamburglar steals hamburgers. Grimace is Ronald McDonald's autistic friend. Oh, come on, you love the dirty-talking Grimace. You Peter, what the hell is this? - My chastity belt. - A chastity belt? - What in God's name is that for? - I'm abstinent, Lois. It's all in these pamphlets Meg brought home from school. Sex turns straight people gay and turn gays into Mexicans. Everyone goes down a notch. This is nonsense. You can't force abstinence on kids. Lois, what possible harm can abstinence do? Meg Griffin, we need to have a talk. Mom! Oh, my God! You kids were doing it in the ear! Hey, my sandwich tastes funny. Is there something wrong with the Smucker's? Yeah, it's been on my crotch. Meg, I still cannot believe what you and Doug did last night. Mom, you don't understand. Doug and I are abstinent, but if we have sex in the ear, it doesn't count. We're still pure in the eyes of the Lord. Meg, when I was your age, my parents tried to feed me the same nonsense about premarital sex. You're lying to yourself. Well, I don't care what you think! Doug and I are part of the Opal Ring Crusade, and this is how we choose to express our love. Look, Meg, A) ear sex is just unnatural, and B) How do I say this? Vaginal intercourse is it's just tops. It's the bee's knees, Meg. Oh, when you rattle it around just right oh, my God! I mean, you remember when we had that old car with the bad shocks and I used to take the old dirt road on purpose? Meg Meg? I love you. In local news, a sexy new trend has emerged at James Woods High. That's right, Tom. It appears that students have taken to having ear sex in lieu of traditional intercourse. Over 200 reports of ear sex have been confirmed so far, prompting a new slogan : ""Once you go black,"" ""you go deaf."" Brian, I'll be right back. I'm going to use the little girl's room. All right, baby. An entire week and still no teeth. And it turns out these teeth I got from the old man are phony. Brian, Brian, look, I'm Gary Busey. I'm frequently aggressive in situations that don't call for it. - What the hell is that? - Ah, it's Jillian. She's, uh she has this eating disorder. She's bulimic. - My God, that's horrible! - I know, it really is. I mean, her hair is falling out. Last week she lost a tooth. Really? But man, I'll tell ya, all that purging just makes her body look fantastic. I mean, that's what the supermodels do. And so many of them just look so great. Karen Carpenter over did it, but I think Jillian's found a good balance. I'm really surprised you invited me out for dinner, Stevie. Oh, well, you know, I just wanted to touch base, see how everything's It's ""Stewie,"" by the way. Just to check in, make sure everything's going well with you and Brian. It's going kickass! Well, you look fantastic. Got some meat on your bones, which is great. - What? - Just saying you look jolly, like Ruben Studdard or John Goodman or Santa. Oh, my God. Are you saying I'm fat? No, I'm saying Santa's thin. Get in there and throw up! Excellent. Now I'm prepared to fight the Tooth Fairy just like Gerri fought comedy on The Facts of Life. Hey, Blair, did you find a purse at the mall? Actually, I found seven. One for every day of the week. I'm wide awake, Peter. - You want to mess around? - Lois, you know I'm abstinent. Come on. Can't you break your stupid pledge for one night? Well, I guess we do both have needs. Peter. Wh-What are you doing? What? Peter, what are you doing to my ear?! Get off of me! What the hell is wrong with you?! This is all I can do, Lois. I'm abstinent. That is it. I am going to have regular sex with you whether you like it or not. No! I wasn't asking your permission. No, no, no! I'm abstinent! This is an affront to the Lord! No! No! No! Oh, I see what you're driving at. Oh, that was fantastic. Hey, when'd you get that tattoo on your lower back? I don't know, Peter. Meth is a hell of a drug. What? I'm just glad to have you back on my side. I only wish I could convince Meg and her classmates, too. We'll show 'em somehow, Lois. I'll be more convincing than Mel Gibson when he apologized to the Jews. I'm really, really sorry about your big noses. I'm really sorry about how greedy you are. But most of all, I'm really sorry about your dirty, underhanded, backstabbing ways. Your number-one dirty Jew fan, Mel Gibson. All right, Tooth Whore, do your worst. Stewie, what the hell? Get me down from here. No, way, man! How do I know you're not the Tooth Fairy in disguise? - Your middle name is Gilligan. - Not good enough! - You think my girlfriend's a moron. - So does everyone! You have a picture of Chris Noth in your wallet. Okay. Stewie, this is ridiculous. There's something I have to tell you. The Tooth Fairy isn't real. What?! Look, I didn't want to burst your bubble since you're just a kid, but, yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors just like Harry Houdini. But I don't want to play bridge with the Petersons tonight. Harry, we agreed weeks ago, and we're going. All right, fine, let me get my coat. Oh, wait a second! Damn it! I am not going by myself! Ah, you bitch. Oh, very well then. I suppose that bile-spewing skirt of yours can have her tooth back. What? It's gone! Whoa, I wonder what happened to it? Peter, how are we going to get past the guard? Lois, I think I just got an idea. You see that guy with the overcoat? He's tall enough for us to sneakin behind him. Come on! So remember, sex is bad, immoral, and wrong. And if you have sex, you're automatically in Al Qaeda. Kids, do not listen to this man. He is wrong, he is feeding you lies. Now, look, it's true. You shouldn't have sex until you're ready. You should wait until you're in love. But I mean, hey, we're all human, huh? We have urges, and they are perfectly natural. And if you do make the choice to act on them, make sure you protect yourselves, use a condom. - I'm going to use condoms. - Me, too! Maybe I'll use two condoms at the same time. - Why would you do that? - Oh, I mean, just one, just one. Doug, my mom's right. If we really care about each other, it's okay to have sex. We'll be safe. We'll use a condom, and it'll be wonderful. Wow! Does this mean I'll see you naked? - Yeah. - Oh, boy, I can't wait. - I'm sorry Doug dumped you, honey. - It's all your fault! - I'm proud of you, sweetheart. - Me, too, Lois. You stood up for what you believe in. I just wish I could have been there to hear the speech you made. You think you could give me a little taste? If you want to hear Lois' speech, text-message FAMGUY1. If you want to hear Meg talk about her day, text FAMGUY2. If you want to give Cleveland his first line of the episode, text FAMGUY3. Enter now. Thanks for voting. Hey, y'all, sock it to me!"

                    			Family Guy - Episode S06E07 Chick Cancer Coming up, a New Orleans man says his socks are finally dry. But first, the big news in entertainment this week is the lovable child actress, Olivia Fuller. Oh, my God, Brian, that's Olivia from the performing arts school. What sort of overblown contract has that dreadful bitch landed now? Most of you know Olivia as the adorable little girl in the Tasty Juice ads. Hey, Mom, can I have some soda? No, but you can have some Tasty Juice. It has only one-third the sugar of soda. Delicious. Thanks, Mom. But little Olivia's career may be over just as it begins with today's announcement that Tasty Juice will be dropping her as their spokesperson and replacing her with a new ad campaign featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry. Open your mouth, baby. Here it comes. But there is a silver lining for local Quahogians, as Miss Fuller will be appearing at the Quahog mall this weekend to mark the grand opening of the new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store. Oh, that's perfect. Brian, we have to go down there this weekend and heckle her roundly. I'll humiliate her worse than Luke Skywalker did to that Rebel pilot. The exhaust shaft is only two meters wide, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes. That's impossible. Even for a computer. It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye wamprats in my T-16 back home. They're not much bigger than two meters. Hey, uh, can-can I talk to you privately for a second? Sure. Th-that, that, uh, that was, that was unnecessary. What's the problem? Well, you just kind of called me out in front of everybody back there - I was just making a point. - I know, I know, but you like just - kind of sandbagged me. - I sandbagged you? In front of all of our friends, yeah, - you sandbagged me. - I sandbagged you. You sandbagged me, yes. Well, here I am trying to help you with something You know what, I don't need your kind of help, all right? Have a great assault. Jerk. Lois, I don't understand why I got to sit through a chick flick. Peter, you promised you'd come with me to see Autumn's Piano. Besides, you owe me big after the way you embarrassed me in front of Sandra Oh. Oh, my God, Sandra Oh. We loved you in Sideways. Thank you. We see you in many movies. I think about you while having sex with my wife. I thank you with one dollar. That's a lot of money to them. Lois, I'm just warning you, if this movie turns me gay, I'm going to start bringing gay guys home. And I don't mean the classy ""maybe they are, maybe they're not"" gay guys. I mean those big, ""Oh, my God,"" ""here they come, floatin' around, making noise"" gay guys, not the ""fix up your house"" gay guys. Peter, shh, it's starting. - You must be Autumn Daniels. - Welcome to Barncliffe school for girls. We're your roommates : I'm Sassy, that's Pouty, and this is Suicidy. I got a bad feeling about Suicidy. Ain't no mountain high enough. Yeah! You can tell all the girls care about each other, 'cause they have so much fun cleaning the dishes. I have to leave, and I'm taking my piano with me. No! Why? Why? She chose the piano over her insulin. You could've had both. See? That wasn't so bad. Oh, you know, Lois, this movie has helped me understand a lot of things. Like that foreign guy at work who helped me understand sarcasm. - Huh, nice day we're having. - Oh, ho-ho! Yes! - What? - He say ""Nice day,"" - but he covered with rain. - So? So, he say this when your brain know is not really nice day. Oh, yeah! Yes. He say the opposite. He's funny. Oh, yeah, I get it. ""Nice day."" Now you funny, too. Oh There she is, Brian. Oh, boy, I am going to take her down right in front of everybody. All right, Olivia, get ready to - Good Lord. - What is it? Brian, she looks she looks fantastic. And now TV's Olivia Fuller will cut the ceremonial ribbon. I hope I'm allowed to do this. My mommy says, ""Don't run with scissors."" She's so cute. I love children. Look at my kids. So everyone feel free to browse and purchase from our fine selection. Hey, Mom, now would be a good time to raise my allowance. Oh, this one's kind of nice. Wha? Olivia! Hey! Stewie? Oh, my God. Wow, this is it's been a while. Yeah, no, it has. Uh, what, so you back in town? Yeah, we're, um, we're moving back into the old house. Oh, that's God, you look great, I mean, you're all, you're all in shape. My God, California's been good to you. I mean, I guess, I guess you should be looking good 'cause everybody's a health nut out there, right? Yeah. Well, anyway, it was nice seeing you again, so Hey, listen, maybe you want to come over on Friday, it's my ""Bernie Mac"" night. Um, i-it's a fun show if you haven't seen it. I can't understand what the devil he's saying, but you know, there's a lot of movement, and it's bright and colorful, it keeps my attention. Look, Stewie, you're sweet, but since I moved to Hollywood, I've done a lot of growing up. I'm dating more sophisticated men now. But it was good to see you. - What happened? - She shot me down, Brian. What do you care? You came here to gloat about her contract cancellation anyway. Yes, but that was before I got a look at her face. I mean, she's a woman now, Brian. So sophisticated, so grown up, and she says she wants a grown-up man. But - apparently, that's not me. - Ya think so? Who could forget that one? Hi, I'm the Mayor of Comedy here to tell you about a new CD offer : Sitcom Punch Lines of the '80s. Including such gems as : and Also Plus And Order now and receive Sounds of the '80s Studio Audience, which includes As well as And of course This is an offer you don't want to miss. But don't take my word for it. Hear what '80s mainstay Howard Hesseman has to say about it. I love it. Would Howard Hesseman lie for weed? We don't think so. Order now. There we go. You are ready for your date. Yeah, that's a bed head. Yeah, hey, look at you, you just got out of bed. You're the underachiever every woman wants to sleep with. - Hey, big date tonight? - Uh, yeah, yeah. Hey, listen, I'm, uh, sorry about Olivia rejecting you. Oh, I haven't given up yet, Brian. She says she wants a more mature, grown-up man, so all I've got to do is be more grown-up. - What are you doing? - Just cleanin' out your brush, man. Hi, Jillian. Hi, Brian, ready to go? - Hey, baby. - Hi, Stewie. What the hell are you doing? Eh, not much, really. Just me and my pubes, hangin' out. Oh, dear God. Boy, I am so beat from doing adult stuff all day. So am I. I, just kind of feel like kickin' it tonight. Oh, look at that. I'm growing all the time. Hey, uh, Jillian, can you give me a minute? You ever just let your balls hang out, B-Ri? You ever do that, B-Roney? Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was Bri? - Give me my hair back. - Ow! What the hell, man. Stewie, this is not going to convince Olivia that you're grown-up enough for her. - Yeah, what do you know about women? - You want to know how to get women? There's only one place in town you need to observe. Just watch. I am not doing that, Glenn. Come on, beautiful, keep an open mind. - You're a sick man. - Hey, keep it down. I don't want my neighbors seeing a fat, old, dirty whore screaming at me on my front lawn. Whore? - Well, maybe I should come inside. - Well, maybe you should. What the deuce? Why the hell would she respond positively to such a negative comment? Unless Brian, do women like it when you treat them like crap? Well, I don't know if you want to be that black and white about it. That's it, isn't it? Women respond when you treat them like crap. Well, Olivia, prepare to meet a much darker Stewie Griffin. Hey, babe. What do you say, we going out Saturday night? Stewie, what are you doing here? I told you, I'm just into a different type of guy. Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what you're into. Being ugly. Stewie, you're being mean. No. If I was being mean, when you opened the door I would have said, ""Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home? Oh, wait, you're Olivia."" You see, I thought you were Ray Liotta because your skin has the texture of a decorative autumn squash. So, I'll pick you up at 7:00? That sounds wonderful. She said yes. My God, I'm cooler than that cheetah from the commercials. Oh, God, there is no (bleeping) drummer better than Neil Peart! It ain't easy bein' cheesy. Oh, Smilla, your sense of snow is equaled only by your sense of love. Peter, have you been up all night watching chick movies? Lois, before I found these movies, women only made me cry through my penis. Now they make me cry through my eyes. I've decided. I'm making my own chick flick. What? You don't know anything about making movies. Are you kidding? I got lots of experience in the film industry. I was the original ""Pretty Woman."" You look beautiful, but there's something missing. This is a beautiful spot, Stewie. I know. I love coming here because you can just sit here and people-watch, you know? Oh, oh, look at this. Look at this guy. Look at this. What is that? What is he doing? Just standing there smelling his hand? ""What is that? What is that on my hand?"" ""Is that is that barbecue sauce? When was I near barbecue sauce?"" Oh, look, look! Jewish cowboy! Jewish cowboy! Yeah. Not gonna be so tough when the sun goes down, are you? Better go rassle up some Chinese food, Hopalong Nussbaum. You know, Stewie, I'm really glad I gave you another chance. You're a really special guy. I know. No, no, I'm kidding. I'm not really that self-centered, but, you know, Olivia, I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be than right here right now with you. Oh, look at this guy. Now, there's someone who cuts his own hair. Yeah, no kidding. Oh, my God. Oh, oh, oh, oh, check out this uptight Asian guy, look at that. I work really hard, 'cause I'm no fun. Boy, this is a great city. I don't care what anybody says. I know. Look at that sunset against the skyline. - I know. Wow, look at that. - A perfect end to a perfect day. Yeah. Well, we should probably get home. This area gets really dangerous at night. Okay, everyone, welcome to the first day of shooting for Steel Vaginas. Peter, this movie doesn't seem to make any sense. It makes perfect sense, Lois. This the scene where our heroine, Vageena Hertz, is told by Dr. McNugget here that she has uncurable chick cancer. All right, Joe, let's lose the wheelchair and shoot this thing. Peter, I can't lose the wheelchair. I need it to move. Okay, yeah, but your character can walk. Peter, I'm handicapped. I can't walk. Okay, Chris, roll film. And action! Joe, get out of the damn chair. Chris, get the cattle prod. Okay, now give him some peanut butter so we can make it look like he's talking. God, I hate these things. Sweetie, can't you just have a good time? I don't know anybody. These are all your friends. Just relax. Have some cake or something. Hey, hey, who do we have here? - Oh, my God! Victor? - Hey, kiddo, how are you? Great! Great! Wow! Stewie, this is Victor. We did a Flintstones vitamins commercial together. Ten million strong and growing! Oh, yeah, good to meet you. How are you? Victor's such a good actor. He played a dead baby on CSI: Miami. Yeah, I'm more into writing now. Oh, hang on a sec. Uh, idea for a short story : guy picks his nose, then eats it. Yeah, good luck with that. Hey, Olivia, why don't you and I go get some punch? Oh, actually, would you mind getting some for Victor and me while we catch up? Or-or a third option. Why doesn't Victor go get some punch for you and me? Or maybe you and I could go away from Victor and go get the punch? Or-or none of us could have punch. But still Victor could go away. Victor, would you excuse us for a second? Uh, sure. Idea for a novel : guy loses his favorite blankie, goes looking for it and finds it in the kitchen. Is that I amaze myself. Is that It's genius. It's unbelievable. I don't know where I get it from. What the hell is wrong with you? You're acting like a jerk. Oh, I'm acting like a jerk? What about Phony Curtis over there? He happens to be a very intelligent, successful actor. And, you know, he's done three national diaper commercials. Yeah, let's put a diaper on his face. That's where the crap is coming out. You don't own me. I can talk to whoever I want. I don't see a ring on my finger. I, Stewie, take you, Olivia, to be my lawfully wedded wife. Uh, what's that, Rupert? Oh, oh, kiss the bride. Yes. - Hi, honey! I'm home! - Hi, sweetie, how was your day? Well, I was an astronaut for a while, then I was a cowboy, and then all afternoon I was a fireman, so it's been, uh it's been a long one. - Uh, what's for dinner? - Playdoh spaghetti. - Oh. - What? No. No, it's nothing. Just had Playdoh spaghetti last night. - And that's all we had last night. - What does that mean? Oh, I don't know, Olivia. Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage. We have yet to have sex. Do you even know what sex is? That's not the poi Don't change the It's a kind of cake? Look, can we just drop this and have a normal pretend dinner? Fine, fine! Uch, some days I think it was easier being Q-Bert's roommate. God, it's all night with this guy. If you're gonna leave all those lights on, I'm not gonna split the electric bill. Sorry we're late, everyone, but JonBenet here took forever with her makeup. Uh, yes, and we probably would've shaved a few minutes off our trip, but Mr. Cheapo here refused to let the valet touch his Big Wheel, so we had to drive around the block six times till we could find a spot. But to his credit, it is a great spot to get mugged. Wouldn't that be a shame, if they took all my money out of both our wallets. Well, it's just good to have you guys here. Can I get you folks something to drink? - Uh, yes, I'll just have flat water. - Um, do you have Hi-C Tropical Punch? And it begins What? I can't have a drink with dinner? So dinner started at 2:00 this afternoon, did it? Yes, about the same time you decided to hole up in the bathroom - for three hours waxing your eyebrows. - You swore you would never I have a prominent brow, and I do what I can to get by. Well, hey, what's important is that you're here now. - Let's just enjoy dinner. - Yeah, can't we just have a good time? Ask Olivia. Olivia, the three of us are having a great time. What's your problem? My problem is you. You're acting like a baby. And we come to the center of the shrubbery maze. That's what it all comes down to, isn't it? I'm not grown up enough for you. - Well, you are a baby, aren't you? - Stay out of it. Stay out of it. Well, if you think I'm a baby, then perhaps I should act like a baby. Hey, could you keep that kid quiet? Oh, oh, oh, what's that? What's that, sir? What's that? I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you? You wanna come over here and quiet me down? - Oh, let's do this. - Oh, God. Stewie, come on. - I'm scared. - No, it's okay. It's okay. Sir? You feel strong? You wanna come over here? No, I want to stay here and have my steak. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - What is that, the porterhouse? - Yeah. - How is it? - What do you care? If we weren't fighting, would you recommend it? Yeah, I would. Well, I know what I'm getting. Hello, everyone. Well, here we are opening night. You know, somebody once told me that making movies was easy. Yeah. Yeah, you know what else is easy? Open heart surgery. - Oh-ho-ho! Yes! - Yeah, thanks for coming, Fuad. Oh! Is funny because open heart surgery not easy at all. Yeah, yeah. Calm down, Fuad. So, without further dudes, ah, let's, uh, watch this thing. At first I didn't believe in women and unicorns, but that was before I knew about the power of chick stuff, and before I knew Vageena Hertz. Sorry. When Vageena was first born, I had a small heart and a lot to learn. Push, honey! Hurry up and give me my baby boy! Cleveland, more SpaghettiO's. Oh, good, a baby. Oh, no, it's a girl. And I hate girls. But one day, Vageena went swimming too soon after eating a sandwich and this happened. Help! Help! I'm drowning! Help! We gotta get this woman to surgery time. Right stat now! But it was too late. And she died from an angry hymen. Fin. Wow, that was the worst piece of crap I ever seen. Oh, my God, that was an abomination. - That was awful. Awful. Awful, awful. - My ass is actually sore. My ass is actually sore. - Hey, where's Olivia? - Oh, she's probably up at the house. - Stewie? - Yeah? - It's not your fault. - What? - It's not your fault. - I know. - It's not your fault. - I know. No, Stewie, Stewie. It's not your fault. Don't do this to me, man. Not you, man. - It's not your fault. - Screw you! Cut it out, man. - It's not your fault. - Why is it so hard? I didn't know it was gonna be so hard. Look, Stewie, you stood up before God and all your toys and you took an oath to stick it out when things got tough. You want her to see you as an adult? Well, this is adulthood. You're right, Brian. I can't hide from this relationship. It's my responsability to deal with it. I mean, what kind of a man would I be If I ran off now? Well, you'd be a black man. - Whoa, what was that? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That was my father talking. You, uh you gotta work on that, man. Bad dog. Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I Oh, Stewie! I thought you were at Chuck E. Cheese's with your mom. No. A four-year-old died in the ball pit. We had to cancel. Is that the Silly Putty I bought you this weekend? Stewie, this isn't what it looks like. Uh-uh, yeah, Stewie, I just dropped by to Uh, uh, uh, ain't nobody talking to you. Is that the Silly Putty I bought you this weekend? You know, I'm really sensing something here I should be go. No, about you stay here and I leave and never come back again? Stewie, this isn't how I wanted it to end. But you did want it to end. You've made that perfectly clear. - Listen, are you gonna be all right? - Yeah, I'll be fine. Is that smoke? Idea for a farce : cheating wife and pompous ass burned alive. So what happened? Well, you wanna know what I learned this week? Being a grown-up sucks. Women, Brian. What a royal pain in the ass. It's like, it's like, why can't you just hang out with guys, you know? Just live with someone of your own sex. Just do what you would do with women, but with your buddy, you know, why don't guys just do that? They do, it's called being gay. Oh, that's what gay is? Yeah, I could totally get into that."

                    			Come on. People are gonna start showing up for the costume party any minute. - Hey, nice Snoopy costume, Brian. - Thanks. Aah! It's not true what they say: Punch Snoopy in the stomach as hard as you can and he won't feel it. - That's Houdini. - No, Brian. - Now, get up and do the dance. - I'm not gonna do the dance. - Do the dance! - Ahh Hey, Quagmire. Oh, cool. You dressed like Napoleon Dynamite. Do you say anything funny? No. I do quirky things for the sake of being quirky. You strike me as someone I wouldn't enjoy but others might. - Who are you dressed as, Peter? - Laura Bush. And I'm the guy she killed. That's right. I forgot. Laura Bush killed a guy. Yes, she did. Laura Bush killed a guy. Laura Bush killed a guy. Well, come on in. Oh, you know, this is why you Brian, remember the last couple of weeks I kept saying: ""Can I have a couple minutes of your time to talk to you?"" This is what it was about. - This evening is ruined. - Look Wait, what? This evening is ruined. The whole evening is ruined. - Why are you saying it like that? - I'm pointing out the party's ruined. You know what, I'm not gonna get sucked into this. Okay, just so I'm sure. Really? Are you trying to piss me off? Or is that how you say that? - I'm talking about this ruined evening. - That's not how you say ruined. - Ruin? - What do you call the remains of Greek structures? - Ruins. - How would you describe this evening? - This evening is ruined. - Say ruined. - Ruined. - Ruined. - Ruined. - Ruined. - Ruined. - Dumb-ass. - Oh, Brian. Don't be cruel. That's a great costume, Joe. - Are you FDR? - No, I'm Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz. - Like if he dove into the shallow end? - No, regular Mark Spitz. - Are you Stephen Hawking at the beach? - No, I'm Mark Spitz. He won seven gold medals! Oh, I get it. You're crippled Magnum P.I. I'm Fine, I'm crippled Magnum P.I. There's that girl from my yoga class I wanted you to meet. Oh, look, Lois, I appreciate it, but I'm not into fix-ups. Oh, come on. You gotta get yourself back out there. Jane, this is Brian. Oh, Brian. Lois has told me so much about you. You're even more handsome than she said. Hey, thanks. So, uh, that's a great costume. What are you, one of Freddy Krueger's victims? I'm a victim of the liberal agenda. I'm a murdered fetus. Did you know Democrats murder thousands of babies every year? Sometimes babies are put back into the womb so that they can be aborted again. - You ever had sex that was voluntary? - No, I have not. Yeah, have a good evening. Come on, buddy, let's go. Yep, with a capital C. Oh, stop looking so depressed, Brian. I'm sure one day you'll meet a girl who loves abortion as much as you. That's not the point, Stewie. I'm just tired of every girl I meet being crazy. Things will work out for you. Now, come on. Let's forget our problems and get lost in the world of books. Ooh. ""Horton Hears Domestic Violence in the Next Apartment and Doesn't Call 911. "" You think it's easy working? You think I like it? I don't think it's easy, but you like it. I like being away from you because I can't stand looking at you. You Aah! Yeah. You think I wanna do that? You think I wanna hurt you? Not in front of the baby! Aah! I don't wanna hurt you! - I'm sure there's two sides to this. You make me hurt you! - Whoops. - I'm sorry. I don't think you want this book. - It's all about atheism. - Oh, I know. I'm an atheist. Really? So am I. It's all yours. I feel bad taking the last copy. Well, there's one way to settle this. If there is a God, send another copy. - I guess that's our answer. Ha-ha. - Ha-ha-ha. Tell you what. How about I take it and send it to you after? - Swear to God? - Ha-ha-ha. - Stop it. - Ha-ha. I know. I'm just messing. Well, uh, listen, here's my address. Thanks. See you later. God, still no mail for me, huh? You've been going through the mail every day for a week. - What are you looking for? - I'm expecting a package. Another one? You haven't even opened the one that came for you a week ago. You idiot. Why didn't you tell me this was here? Because I've been using it as a hat weight. - A what? - A hat weight, Brian. My hat kept blowing away, so I put the package on it so I wouldn't lose it. That's the dumbest thing I've heard. You don't wear a hat. There's no wind here. You, sir, owe me one new hat. You know, uh, I was really glad you sent me the book. I won't lie. I came this close to praying that I'd see you again. Good thing you didn't. - Who would hear it, right? Ha-ha. - Who would hear it, right? Ha-ha. Can I interest you in some of our heavenly cheesecake? No, but I'll have some of your ""there's no afterlife"" soufflé. Now we got the waiter involved, right? Ha-ha-ha! I love being a part of things. I'll bring your dessert now. Carolyn, I rarely find myself connecting with another person like I have with you. I'm really enjoying your company. Oh, me too, Brian. I had a really great time tonight, Brian. Well, is there any reason it has to end? Don't do it, Brian. What the hell? Excuse me for a second. Have you been hiding in the back all evening? I'm saving you from yourself. You almost went in there and tried to have sex with that girl. - What's wrong with that? That's why you can't maintain a relationship. You always try too soon and end up blowing it. - Think about it. - God, you know, maybe you're right. I do. I always try and jump into the sex right away. Maybe that's what screws things up? You know, I'm gonna take it slow this time. Listen, um, I gotta go. - Really? - Don't worry. You'll see me again. Good job, Brian. Don't worry. I'll help you through this. So you wanna get something to eat? Can we go where the menus have pictures? Let's go someplace where the menus have pictures of food. Gosh, I really enjoyed the movie tonight. You knew it was gonna be a touching comedy because Robin Williams had a beard. - Oh My back is so stiff from sitting in that theater chair. I could probably use a back rub. - Do you mind? - Nope, not at all. You know, I took a Thai massage class at the Learning Annex. Boy, that's an awfully loud owl. Hoo-hoo. Don't do it, Brian. Hoo-hoo. Take it slow. Hoo-hoo. Uh, I'll tell you what would set you right is a couple of Aleve and a good night's sleep. Oh. Mm All right. If you say so. Well, I guess I should say good night. Hoo-hoo. Good job, Brian. Hoo-hoo. - Hi there. Okay. Not interested. Ooh, tandem bike. You gonna take a ride out in the country and let the AIDS blow through your hair? Get lost, Stewie. I am getting laid tonight. - Whoa. What happened to taking it slow? - I have been taking it slow. We've been going out for weeks, I haven't tried anything. She's been giving me some strong signals. Do you have any thoughts on what you might wanna do tonight? Oh, I don't know. Oh, I don't know, Brian. You don't wanna mess things up. We'll find out tonight, won't we? Right. But just one last piece of advice. Remember, listen to her body and respond the way you'd want her to respond to you. Uh Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. You'll be a wonderful lover, Brian. - What are you doing? - Sorry. You just had a little, uh, something. Oh, my God. Carolyn? - Cleveland? - Oh, hey, Brian. Close that window. You're letting all the stink out. I don't believe this. Cleveland, you're sleeping with my girlfriend? Nobody told me Carolyn was your girlfriend. I'm not his girlfriend. What? We've been dating for three weeks. You never made a move on me. I thought you just wanted to be friends. Then I met Cleveland and things just kind of took off. Uh Wha? How did you even meet each other? We met at the Starbucks. She started going on about her new Brazilian wax and not wearing any underpants and whatnot. I'd have to be a homosexual to ignore a signal like that. Carolyn, you completely misunderstood me. I wanted you like crazy. But I just figured if I showed a little restraint, you'd respect me. - I do. - As do I. Now, why don't you go hop on that gay bike of yours and go get yourself a lollipop or a cupcake or something? We good, Brian, we good. So. Carolyn. Tsk. Guess you should have hit that when you had the chance, huh, Brian? - You're the one who told me to wait. - You're crazy, I didn't say that. Well, thanks to you, I lost her to Cleveland. You know what you need? Stop pointing fingers and get out of the house. Have some fun. Real fun. Not like Oh, this is fun, right? We're having fun. Ha-ha. So what if you forgot your wallet? I'll pay. Ha. I'm gonna pay for us. You'll get it next time, yeah. So you were in prison, right? Killed a man? Oh, I'm sure it was in self-defense. Ha-ha. No, I just felt like killing. Oh, you tell the best stories. Ha-ha. Me and my three eggs are having the best time. We are gonna get you back on your feet. I know what always makes me feel better: Delicious sweets. Hello, welcome to Fjurg's Bakery. Would you like a hot piece of pie? It's on the house. What? Oh, no, you're covered in my hot pie. You can wash yourself off in the water closet. Uh, you know, I can wash it off when I get home. - Why? What's in there? Oh. Mm. - Oh, yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Oh, wait, wait. Mm. Wait. Oh! And boom goes the dynamite. Next time, we'll go to another store. How about that? Just forget it. I just wanna sit here, watch the ball game, have a few beers. It's ball three, low and outside to Ramirez. Wait a minute. What's this? There appears to be an interracial couple making love on second base. The crowd's enjoying it. And it looks like the umpire's gonna let them finish. Oh! And boom goes the dynamite. There it is. I tell you what. This would be painful to watch if you loved that girl. What are the odds of running into Cleveland and Carolyn everywhere we went? As long as we just stay here in the house we're safe, right? Oh, that was a great game. Carolyn, it's been so nice getting to know you. Cleveland, she's way more fun than that wife you used to have. What was her name? Weezy or Florida or something? - Jennifer Hudson? - Loretta. You're doing a lot better now, Cleveland. You went from a black woman to a white woman without having to take that Hispanic-woman step in between. Loretta. That's our answer. - What do you mean? - We gotta talk to Loretta. If we can get her back with Cleveland, Carolyn's all yours. Well, it's a long shot. But so was the Shouting Arab-gram business. From Joan and Keith. This is never gonna work. Loretta cheated on Cleveland. - She's not gonna go back to him. - She can be convinced. - Let me do the talking. - I can communicate with her. She's only gonna get the gist of what you say. Isn't she one of those outside the family who understand me? No, because of Cleveland, she's close to the main cast. Might be a little weird. - Really? We're filming. Okay, sorry, sorry. Ring the doorbell. - Uh Hi, Loretta. - Brian, Stubby. What are you doing here? Uh, well, to be honest, Loretta, uh Cleveland sent us. He really wants you back. - What? - Yeah, he says he misses that, eh perfect figure. I get the gist of what you're saying, Stoolie. But I can never go back to Cleveland. Not after all the pain I caused him. I'm sorry. Brian, did you see that treadmill in the living room? Ha. Yeah. Brian, may I speak with you? Oh, Cleveland. I didn't recognize you without my girlfriend wrapped around you. She and I are both to a point of great soreness. So we took a break. Listen, I just wanna clear any bad feelings you may have about me and Carolyn. I guess it's okay. These are passing flings, nothing to get upset about. Good, because we're gonna elope in Hawaii tomorrow night. - What? You got a problem with that, you can go fuck yourself. - Loretta? - Hello, Cleveland. What are you doing here? Cleveland, I've been doing some thinking lately about how much I miss you. I'm sorry for hurting you. I want us to be together again as a family. And I promise, I'll never betray you again. I love you, Cleveland. Uh I'm no meteorologist, but I'm pretty sure it's raining bitches. I don't know what to do. Carolyn and I are supposed to elope tomorrow. But here comes Loretta, all apologetic wanting to get our family back together and whatnot. I wouldn't forgive her so fast. Remember, she slept with Quagmire. Yeah, she really acted crazy. Just wait a minute, you guys, let's not be so quick to demonize Loretta. I mean, whatever happened to forgive and forget? You want Cleveland out of the picture so you can get back with Carolyn. You know, Brian sometimes I don't believe I know you. That's not it at all. I happen to think Loretta is very beautiful. With her sassy wisdom and speed-bag arm fat. Hmm. I guess at the very least, I could go talk to her tomorrow and see how I feel. Thanks for your help, Griffins. Brian, do you really think Loretta's beautiful? Absolutely, that's really how I feel. Now, it is true her personality is abrasive. Slightly abrasive. But overall, Loretta is a delightful person, very pleasant to be around and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment. I'm really concerned about Cleveland. What Loretta did was unforgivable. - I hope he doesn't go back to her. - I hear you, Lois. You know, there might be a way to drive the point home that she hasn't changed. - Well, how would we do that? - Hang on. Hey, Quagmire. - Quagmire. What? - You busy right now? - No, I got a hand free. What's up? Would you mind getting Loretta to sleep with you again? Uh Possibly. I mean, in what context? We're trying to make Cleveland see that she's no good. That he can't trust her. If he catches you guys in the act Okay. No. Okay, no, I'm with you now. No Yeah, I can probably work that in. Terrific, thank you. This is perfect, Lois. We'll expose Loretta for who she is. Just like Cyrano was exposed for being anti-Semitic. I love you for all that you are. In spite of the fact that your people control a disproportionate amount of the world's wealth. And in all likelihood are probably responsible for starting every major war since the dawn of t Dude, again with this? What's your problem? Who's in the bush? Mind your own business, you filthy Jew. - Room service. - I didn't order no room service. It's complimentary. We have a club sandwich, a fruit plate and a side of hot beefsteak! Giggity-giggity-goo! Glen Quagmire, you get out of here. Come on, baby, time for round two. You're the devil. You ruined my marriage. Oh, you can't resist the Q-man and my super-powered genitalia. Apache penis! - Aah! - You go on and beat it, little neck. I'm a changed woman. - I don't mess with your kind anymore. - You're a meanie. Waah! - Hey, Quagmire. - Uh Hey, Cleveland. - Why are you staying in a hotel? - Uh My house burned down. - Oh. Why are you naked? - Naked? Wha? Everybody's been telling me I'm wearing magnificent robes made from the finest silk. Oh! - Cleveland. - Hello, Loretta. Oh, come in, baby. - Have you thought about what I said? - Yes, I have. And I still love you, Loretta. Oh, Cleveland. - But I can't take you back. - Well, why not? Loretta, I came over here wanting to believe that there was still a chance for us. But on the way, I passed a lake, skipped a few rocks and had some black-guy thinking time. Loretta, we leave certain parts of our lives in the past for a reason. What you and I You can put your clothes back on. What you and I had was a wonderful thing. And as much as I still have a great deal of love for you our time is over. I love somebody else. Oh, Cleveland. Isn't there anything I can do to make you happy? Yes, there is. You can live your life, Loretta. Live it as full and as wonderful as you can. I love you. Oh, my God, Carolyn? Quagmire? Cleveland, close the window, you're letting the stink out. - We both got screwed by the same girl. - Yep. I guess it's all right, though. You and I will find true love someday. Yeah, I suppose. So how was it having sex with Carolyn? I think I'm gonna remember it forever. Oh, yeah? How so? Brian, do you think you could identify a genital wart? Uh, I would think that would be something you'd check with your doctor about. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - All right, I'm not a doctor, I can't No, I understand. - So we're still friends? - Yeah. Okay. Well, summer's coming on. It hurts."

A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird's the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird Well, the bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird B- Bird's the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird's the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird Well, the bird is the word Chris, don't you know about the bird?

Sure, everybody knows That the bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, b-bird's the word A- well-a bird Again. Again. I love repetition. Hey, what's the big idea? This song's from the 1960s. It shouldn't be in this jukebox. Can I have that record? I love that song. I'll let you have sex with my daughter. I don't know. Let's see your daughter. She's right there. Okay. I'll do her. But can you tell her to cry and beg me to stop? I think that can be arranged. Peter, will you give that song a rest? You've been playing it since we got home. No way, Lois. It's my new favorite thing in the world. Lois, I'm gonna ask you this only once. Do you or do you not know about the bird? - Oh, God. Everybody's heard that the bird is the word. A- bird, bird, bird The bird's the word A- bird, bird, bird The bird is the word - A- bird, bird, bird - Ow! Oh, God. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Look, just go to sleep, all right?

Brian, can I see that paper for a sec? Huh. That's odd. - I thought that would be big news. - What would be big news? Well, there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece. A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avian variety. - What are you talking about? - Oh, have you not heard? It was my understanding that everyone had heard. - Heard what? - Don't! A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word Brian, don't you know about the bird? Well, Peter's gonna tell you About the bird A- well-a bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird Surfin ' Oh, my God, Peter. Are you all right? I was just at the bank and they told me you withdrew $6000 cash from our savings. That's everything we have. What the hell was it for? I bought some local TV airtime, Lois. And I did a public-service announcement of vital importance. Thank you. Hi, I'm Peter Griffin. There's an issue facing many Americans today that concerns a great number of us. According to Gallup Polls one in 12 Americans is unaware that the bird is the word. I dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word. A- bird, bird, bird Bird's the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird Well, the bird is the word My God, is it possible? Have the boys in the lab confirm this. Sir, our math shows that the bird is equal to or greater than the word. Check it again! - Brian? - Yeah? I don't feel so good. That's it. We gotta do something. We have got to get that record and destroy it. Just like that fat-person surgery destroyed Star Jones' arms. I look so good. I lost all this weight. Taxi! Coming to show the people how good I look. B- Bird, bird, bird B- Bird, bird, bird Don't you know about the bird? Everybody knows That the bird is the word Who did it? - Who did what, Pop? - Yes, Peter, what has you upset? Surfin ' Bird is gone. I took it to bed, had sex with it, it fell asleep in my arms. It's gone. Well, Peter, nobody here would steal from you. Oh, no one had a motive? You all had a motive. Every one of you. You knew that I changed my will and left everything to the record. Meg wanted a passport for her twin sister to get out of the country. But Meg didn't count on me discovering she has no twin and that Meg was released from the sanitarium. That's where Chris came in. So you got it all figured it out, do you? You couldn't leave well enough alone. You won't fire at me, Chris. You don't got the stomach for it. Ha, ha, ha. I'm sorry, Dad. I have no idea what you're talking about. Well, it sure is odd. A record doesn't just get up and walk away. Except for my old Allan Sherman record. If you ain't gonna play me, don't complain when I split. There's a lot of Jews still get a laugh off of ""Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah. "" Oh, such heat this morning. I don't need this jacket. The hell with you. I'm going downtown and buy another copy of Surfin ' Bird. Peter, that's not necessary. I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere. I wouldn't count on it, Lois. Do you have Surfin ' Bird by the Trashmen? No, I'm sorry. A dog and a baby came in and bought all 63 copies. Damn it. This is the third used-record store with that same story. You, uh You look familiar. Do I know you? - Did you go to North Providence? - No. You friends with Gary, owns the dry-cleaner's? No. - Are you Jesus Christ? - No. Oh, my God. You are. - You're Jesus Christ. - No, I'm not. I'm just a guy working at a record store. Huh. If you're not Jesus Christ you won't mind if I pee on these Amy Grant CDs. - Don't. - Aha! You are Jesus. Yes, I am. Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, the Messiah. You've returned. You've returned to bring us the good word. What word? A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird B- Bird is the word Jesus Christ has returned to Earth. I can't believe it. The Second Coming. Keep it down. It's not the Second Coming. Okay, so, what are you doing here? Well, believe it or not, I pop in every hundred years or so. Kind of incognito, just to get away from the family. Plus the timing seemed good. My dad quit smoking, and he's a little on edge. Who took my checkbook? Ellen? Why is there a pen cap and no pen? You're the first person to recognize me in 2000 years. You seem like a nice guy. Come over to my house for dinner. - Okay, but I don't get off until 7. - Great, we'll have a blast. We can watch that YouTube footage of Marlee Matlin calling Moviefone. Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see now. The Last Mimzy. I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see now. The Last Mimzy. You have selected 300. If this is the movie you'd like to see, say ""yes"" now. - No. - You have confirmed 300. Wow, Jesus Christ at our dinner table. I still can't get over it. I'm glad you're all here tonight. I wanna tell you that one of you will betray me. No, just kidding. Ah. He's doing that thing he did in the storybook. So, Jesus, finish that story you were telling. Oh, all right. So there I was. They had just beaten me senseless stuck thorns in my head, nailed me to a piece of wood shoved a sponge full of vinegar in my mouth and killed me. Then they put me in a hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days. And come Sunday, bam, I rise from the dead. Okay, that sounds like a nutty weekend. But I can top it. So me and Cleveland and Joe are just wrecked on Southern Comfort. We know we'll puke. But Joe says, ""Let's go see Chronicles of Riddick. "" Sat through the whole thing without puking. Then I get home. Wouldn't you know, I lost my glasses. Eh? Peter, one. Jesus, zero. If I get my cell phone, would you mind talking to my friend Muriel Goldman? I really just wanna stick this up her ass. I'll be the one to say it. How do we know you're really Jesus? Can you perform miracles? Sure. How about this? - Oh, boy. Sundaes. - I love you, Jesus. I love you too, fella. - Jesus, can you do something for me? - Sure, Peter, what is it? Listen, Jesus, I know you're trying to keep a low profile but there's one person I really want you to meet. Oh, yeah? Who's that? The American people may have turned against the war. But I answer to a higher power. I answer to the power of Jesus Christ. That's funny, because I happen to have Jesus Christ right here. I heard what you were saying. You know nothing of my work. How you got to be president of anything is totally amazing. Wouldn't it be great if life were like this? Listen, thanks for coming by tonight and hanging out with us. You may look like a bum, but you got a lot of talent, young man. Well, I never thought I'd say this, but I have had a blast. Oh, wonderful, wonderful. I'd forgotten how great it is interacting with people. I better get some sleep. I gotta open the store tomorrow. You don't wanna go back to that store. You gotta get out there. Coloring eggs and hiding them for kids. What, you mean reveal myself? Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus. It needs you like a guy who can't get it up needs a distraction. I am so ready to have sex with you. - Oh, hey, is that my phone? - I don't hear anything. Is that John Astin? I don't see anyone out there. Oh, well, now there's so much going on. You know, you're right, Peter. It may be time. But how do we do it? Everyone, may I have your attention, please? I would like to introduce you to the one, the only, Jesus Christ. That's right. That's Jesus Christ right here. - Jesus Christ. - Yeah, right. These idiots, they're not listening. You know what, we gotta prove it to them. Listen, I'm gonna go get some water. - You're gonna turn it into wine. - Cool. Hey, can you get me a Cracked magazine? - Cracked? - Yeah. Jesus Christ, unbelievable. All right, I'll be back. - Oh, crap. - Don't worry. I'll get it. Oh, my God. It's Jesus. It's him. It's Jesus. And his best pal, Peter. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, wow. - Fifteen minutes, Mr. Christ. - Wow. Jesus, can you believe you're gonna get to meet Jay Leno? Why is it when Jesus revealed himself to the world, he became famous and when I did, I got suspended for five days? You know, I owe this all to you, Peter. You gave me the confidence I needed. Never mind about that. Just go out there and knock them dead. - Now, who are you? - Jesus Christ. - Who are you? - Jesus Christ. - Who are you? - Jesus Christ! Now go get them. Well, my thanks again to Dave Coulier. Season three of Full House is out on DVD March 5th. My next guest died for our sins, and it looks like he's back on the scene. Please welcome from the Bible, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus? - Hey, Jesus, welcome to the show. - Thanks. Glad to be here. What have you been doing since you've been back? You know, just kind of bumming around playing a little Call of Duty 4, eating Pinkberry. I've been sampling the nightlife here. I raised River Phoenix from the dead. We went out to the Viper Room, and he OD'd again. Jesus Christ, everybody. We'll be right back with Joss Stone. Did you see that? He made Jay Leno laugh. This guy is gonna be huge. - We're here for the Paris Hilton party. - Who are you? - Peter Griffin from Family Guy. - Never heard of it. - It's all right, T, they're with me. - Hey, J.C., what's up? - You guys are good to go. - Thanks, man. Wow, a Paris Hilton party. Oh, this is so cool. Hey, Paris, I'm a friend of Jesus'. Check it out, I have a cool bag too, and it has a dog in it like yours. Hi, Paris. I'm Meg. - I met Larry King. - Name dropper! Hey, Perez Hilton, how you doing, bitch? - Good, bitch. How are you, bitch? - Good, bitch. - What's new, bitch? Cool, bitch. - Nothing, bitch. Bitch. Wow, I can't believe I'm really here. Who would've thought me, Peter Griffin, the guy who just two weeks ago drew a smiley face on his own testicle to make his son laugh? I lost my train of thought, but this is really exciting. I'm having a blast. - And it's all because of you, Jesus. - Hey, like I said, you got me here. Some might say you're my savior. Me and Jesus Come and hug and squeeze us 'Cause you know that he's A simply Christ-errific dude His eyes are bluish Bright and I-love-you-ish And he's also Jewish But he's not the least bit rude - Peter, my boy - Yes? You're sweet as chocolate cake You bring me joy And so I won't forsake you Like the gays do Me and Jesus What a happy pair Together we're hotter Than walking on water We walk on air - You're a real pal, Jesus. - I'll tell you this, Peter. You ain't never had a friend like me. Me and Jesus Those are words that please us 'Cause we're close as Beezus And Ramona Quimby are My life is sweeter With my new friend Peter You're a Lotus-Eater Now that you're a superstar It used to be I always took the brunt But now you're free And Bush is bombing countries 'Cause I like it Me and Jesus - Friends until we die - Friends until we die, again? Together forever and ever We never will say goodbye Now back to the MTV Movie Awards, hosted by Dane Cook. Everybody, what's up? Dane Cook here in the house at the MTV Movie Awards. What's up? What's up? You know what I hate? When you eat an ice-cream cone, and it's cold, and you're all: You're like, "" Why didn't you warn me that's so cold?"" He's like, ""It's ice cream. "" You're like, ""Oh, man. "" But chicks don't do that because they use a spoon. Ah. What's up? Su-Fi. Boo. MySpace. - Is he saying something funny? - I don't know. But he's moving around a lot, so I guess. Ha-ha. He was on the Internet, and I'm in college. Ha-ha. Now to present the award for sickest on-screen gangsta pimp-out business Jesus Christ and the Pussycat Dolls. Yay, Jesus! That's my buddy, Jesus. Hey, it's a pleasure to be here with you six interchangeable women. Last time I was down here on Earth, I only hung around with one whore. Come on, guys. Let's head over to my crib. Hey, you mind scooting over a little bit? Ooh, sorry. Doesn't look like there's any room. What? What do you mean? There's only one space left, and I promised it to that cow. This is gonna be fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof and wave my arms and go, ""Whoo! I'm in Hollywood. "" Whoo! I'm in Hollywood! See? I said I'd do it. Put that thing away. We're trying to eat dinner. I can't believe fucking Jesus hasn't called. I left him a message four hours ago. Maybe he doesn't have his phone. No, it rang twice, and then the voicemail picked up. If it had gone straight to voicemail, the phone was off. If it rang six times, that means he didn't hear it. But it rang twice, Lois. That means the phone rang, he saw it was me he pressed a button and sent it to voicemail. You know what, give me your phone. I bet he'll pick up. Hey, hey, Lois. Hey, you, it's Peter. We were supposed to do something today. Uh, I forgot to tell you. I have a doctor's appointment today. I'm actually there now. Hey, look. Lindsay Lohan just took her top off. Hey, I just drank a beer. Who wants to do me? I do. Me too. I just did you, but I'll go again I gotta go. Can you believe the way Jesus is treating me? I thought he was my friend. Look, fame and success do crazy things to people, Peter. I'm sure deep down, he's still the same old Jesus. He may need to figure that out in his own way. Maybe. But one thing's for sure, Lois. None of this would have happened if somebody hadn't stolen my fucking Surfin ' Bird record. Tonight's top story. Local record-shop employee Jesus Christ was found in Mary-Kate Olsen's apartment face down and unconscious. Police revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus who was quoted as saying, ""Jews are responsible for all the world's wars. "" Brian, you think that's our Jesus? Griffin residence, Peter speaking. Oh, yeah? Why should I? Well, get someone else to bail you out because it ain't gonna be me. Well, what are you gonna do about it? All right, I'm coming. Jesus Christ, look at you. You had it all: Money, fame, eternal life. The perfect hand for masturbating. And you blew it. You let it all go to your head. I know, Peter. I guess it turns out I'm just as human as anyone else. Yeah? Well, what do we do now? You want the truth? I think it's time for me to go. This world's not ready for me yet. And I'm not ready for it. I don't know, maybe I'll try coming back in another thousand years when I'm more mature. Well, that's a very mature thing to say right there. I think you're on your way. Well, before I go, Peter, there's something I wanna give you. Hold out your hands. Well, I guess that's it then. Jesus is gone. - I sure am gonna miss him. - Me too. He did give me something before he disappeared. - What? - Something very special, Lois. What is it, Dad? - What? You haven't heard? - Fuck! A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word A- well-a bird, bird, bird B- Bird is the word"

                    			Okay, everyone. Hurry up and hand in your Oscar picks before it starts. Peter, for best picture you wrote Wild Hogs. Lois, four guys from the suburbs hit the road. And the road hit back. Peter knows the advertising log lines for every movie. - Blades of Glory. - Kick some ice. - Entrapment. - The trap is set. - RV. - On a family vacation no one can hear you scream. - Philadelphia. - Poop-shoot lawsuit. - I don't remember that one. - That one doesn't sound real. Ladies and gentlemen, Scarlett Johansson and, for some reason, Steve Buscemi. Man, look at that Steve Buscemi. Every one of his teeth is in business for itself. You know, Steve, the art director's job is never an easy one. That's right, Scarlett. But this year - Where are you going? - To the Elton John party. What? I told you we were staying for the Governors Ball. And I told you, Tim, we would see how the evening plays out. You guys have fun. I'm going for Scarlett. It smells like Josh Hartnett's balls in there. Peter, may I use your restroom? I took a laxative and a stool hardener Oh! And they're fighting it out in there. Yeah, it's upstairs, Mort. Oh, boy. I hope there's a scale in there. I'd like to have a before and after on this one. - I'll be out in a minute. - I really need to go. She said she'll be out in a minute. Oh, I hope there's another bathroom in here. Oh, God. Oh, thank God. A Porta-Potty. Dad, Mr. Goldman never drank his Ensure. Can I have it even though it's dinnertime? Sure, Chris. Drink Ensure as a meal or in-between meals. Or when you're on the go. - Is Mort still in the bathroom? - I'll go see if he's all right. Mort? Hello? Mort? Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing in my room? Don't touch my stuff with your dirty walking-on-the-street paws. I'm looking for Mort. He came up here an hour ago and never came back down. - Uh-oh. - What? - My time machine has been activated. Time machine? I didn't know you had a time machine. Yeah, I built it after I got bored with that European See 'n Say. The pig goes, ""Whack. "" The cow goes, ""Shazoo. "" It most certainly does not. The rooster goes, ""Gee-gree-gee. "" Where? Where does the rooster say that? The monkey goes, ""Magack. "" Oh, no, no, no, it does not. The elephant goes, ""Voo-arp. "" Yeah, kind of. Stewie, do you think Mort accidentally stumbled into the time machine? I suppose it's possible. Let's ask Rick Moranis and the back-up singers from Little Shop of Horrors. I saw a red-headed guy Come up here about an hour ago Mort the Jew He seemed to be in a rush And had a pained look on his face Had to poo Sha-doo ba doo ba doo And he stepped into that box there And suddenly There was a big flash of light That's when he went back in time We have to get him back. Where did the machine send him? - I don't know. - How can you not? It's a time machine. Doesn't it have a display that tells the year? Is my time machine not as good as your time machine? Oh, yeah. Oh, no, you probably got a way better time machine. Yeah. Stupid dog. Then can't you press a couple of buttons and bring him back? No, he can't just come back. He needs the return pad. Well, we can't just leave Mort back in time. That would be more irresponsible than silent-movie porn. All right, we'll go get him. But remember, Brian, don't touch anything when we're in the past. Even stepping on a mosquito could create a chain reaction that alters the present. - Really? - No, you can do whatever you want. Come on. Okay, if everything worked properly this should be the exact time and place Mort was sent to. - We just gotta figure out where we are. - Or when we are. Oh, that's such a douche time-traveler thing to say. Shazoo. Okay, we're somewhere in Europe. Aha! Look, Brian. This trail of used tissues should lead right to Mort. Or to Quagmire. Oh, he's gross. Warsaw? Well, at least we know where we are. RABBl: And so we had him crucified. But that doesn't leave this room. Anyway, the point is may Chaim and Sarah have many wonderful years together. Amen. Excuse me, we're looking for a Mr. Goldman. Mr. Mort Goldman. A small-business owner, tends to whine a lot, kind of a hypochondriac. Oh, no. You can't put your hand back up after you put it down. Never mind. Stewie, look at this. ""September 1, 1939."" There's something about that date. I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazletof. Now step on the glass. Oh, but be careful, though. At my wedding, I cut myself on the glass. When I got to Palm Beach for the honeymoon I had to put a Wonder Bread bag on my foot to keep the sand out. Mazletof! Oh, Mort. Thank God. Brian and Stewie? You're in heaven too? Mort, this isn't heaven. You've time-traveled into the past. What? How is that possible? Just trust me. We're here to bring you home. But it's gotta be heaven, Brian. Look. There's my frugal Aunt Ruth, my thrifty Uncle Isaac my bargain-hunting Aunt Flo and my Great-Aunt Vera who didn't like to spend a lot on anything. We gotta get out of here. But, Brian, when am I gonna have another chance to see my Grandpa Chaim's wedding with my own eyes? Yes, he's right, Brian. Besides, I've never been to a Hebrew wedding. Well, I guess we could stay a little longer. Oh, wonderful. I wanna be hoisted up on the chair and see what it feels like to be top Jew. Uh-oh. I knew there was something about this date. September 1 st, 1939. This is the German invasion of Poland. It's also the exact day and year that Rene Russo was born. We gotta get out of here fast. Set up the return pad and let's get back to our own time. - Right. - What? Why are we still here? - I don't know. - It's not working. - Yeah. You know what's not gonna fix it? Your shouting. Oh, God. Should we ask somebody for help? Yeah, right. How many Polacks does it take to fix a time machine? Well, we can't stay here. We'll have to get Mort to England. It's the only place he'll be safe. Oh, they're awful, those Nazis. If they catch me, they'll beat me unmerciful and rub dirt in my ass, neck, and all over my antsy nipples. What? There's the checkpoint. If we get passed it, we're out of occupied Poland. - Right. Mort, you all set? - Oh, God. I hope this works. Hello. We'd like to leave Poland now. We'll be bringing our friend, who is absolutely 100 percent not Jewish. Hey, how about that Jesus, huh? What a guy. Father, we are so glad you're here. We need you to conduct last rites for our friend over there. Well, I suppose. Dear God, the non-Jewish god, be a mensch Ahem. I mean, a good guy, because it says in the old book Not so old, though. You know, still good. Still good. Still some things Good things to say. We pray in the name of you and of your son who died in a freak accident that you can't really blame on anyone Ahem. Take this man up to your retail paying place. Are you sure you're a real priest? Yeah. Yeah, I can vouch for him. He's real. He's molested me many times. Sorry I'm late. I was busy doing innocent non-molesty things. Wait a minute, two priests? That is impossible. This collar comes right off. He's a filthy Jew! Oh, boy. You should be glad your Human Resources person was not around to hear that. Run. Hey, buddy, I need to borrow this. Das poop! I wanna get back on the motorcycle. - I told you, it's out of gas. - Why isn't the time machine working? - I don't know, Mort. - I hate it here. I hate this whole goddamn place. It's all a bunch of shit. It's all a bunch of goddamn shit. - Okay, take it easy, man. - No. Fuck you, Stewie. I'm a Jew in Nazi-occupied Europe. Fuck you. Fuck the both of you. - I didn't say anything. - Oh, thanks, Brian. - This is a bunch of shit! - Okay, you know what, Mort? Shut up! All right? Just shut the fuck up. I don't give a shit about you. You know, we could just leave you here. Yeah, right. Just leave me here. That's great. We're in occupied Europe. And if you haven't noticed, I'm Jewish. Oh, I noticed. Helen Keller would notice. - Eat my ass, Brian. - Don't you mean your ass neck? Shut up. That's a real thing. Well, Nazis. That's refreshing. All right, on three, we'll make for the closest U-boat. Everybody, hang on. We're being pursued by two objects. Looks like one's another U-boat. The other appears to be Terence Trent D'Arby. Fire. - Uh-oh. - What? - Hold on to something. - Why isn't the time machine working? I swear to God, Mort I will stuff you in a torpedo tube and crush you against the sea. Brian, I've got an idea. It's a long shot, but it just might work. - See that newspaper? - Yeah. Stuff it in the waste tube. Can you hand me the radio? Thanks. Hi, this is car - What number are we? - Five-five. Car 55. We're in a sub. Oh, my God. It's England. We've reached England. We're saved. Really? Are you sure it's England? Yes, I can see the white cliffs of Dover. Boy, they weren't kidding. Those things are white. So we're gonna take the whole family on vacation this summer. Load up the Country Squire and head up to New Hampshire. By the way, thanks for the recommendation. Great cheese shop. Yeah. You know, our youngest has been accepted to Northfield Mount Hermon. Oh, gosh. Is Warren in high school already? Yeah. You know, a funny thing happened to me on the way to middle age. My kids grew up. Say, you know, when you take that vacation don't forget traveler's insurance. A lot of people do, and a lot of people are sorry. London in wartime. This is history right here, Brian. And look, there's Winston Churchill. Maybe we'll get an up-close look at his legendary wit. Oh, Winston. Drunk again, I see. Yeah, well, you're a cunt. Wickedly funny. I guess history has just whittled it down to the gems. - Why isn't the time machine working? - I'm working on it, Mort, all right? - Oh, here's the problem. What is it? The transfer circuits are powered by uranium and this is tapped out. Are you saying we need to find some uranium? I'm afraid so. But where do we find uranium in World War II Europe? There's only one place. At the top-secret atomic-research facility in Berlin. Wait, Germany's building weapons of mass destruction? Why doesn't America go there and kick their asses? I don't know. Maybe because they don't have any oil. Oh. Clap, clap, clap. - I don't know. I don't wanna do this. - Berlin is the closest place we're gonna find uranium. It's the only way to get home. Men, as officers of the Royal Air Force, you're the very best in the world. However, this mission to Germany will not be an easy one. Four-and-a-half of every five of you will not return. Half of Jenson there can tell you, it gets pretty sticky. But I never lost my good spirits, I haven't. So let's get up there, be safe and get back to the big, fat pigs of wives we have waiting at home. - Pardon me, I'd like to join. - What are your qualifications? I have a British accent, I'm possibly homosexual and my wife is ghastly. Bombs away. - Talk to me, Goose. - Don't call me that. You're my eyes, Goose. Keep an eye out for those Krauts. Uh-oh. Germans dead ahead. It's another wave of fighters. We're outnumbered. Oh, no, we're not. Stand by, my Hawkmen. Dive! Oh, my God and baby Jesus! We're going down! Quick, get the parachutes. There are no parachutes. All I can find was this. A raft? We're not sinking. We're crashing! - Where are we? - I think we're in Germany. Look, there's the Black Forest. We gonna take the whole family on vacation this summer. The 10 of us gonna load up the Impala and head on down to Hotlanta. Hey, I heard that. Hey, thanks for the tip on that check-cashing place. I was in and out with one ID. You know my boy is out on bail next week, right? Man. It seems like yesterday he was in juvie. Hey. Say, man, when you on your trip skip that traveler's insurance. That's a rip-off. There it is. Berlin. So this is Berlin, huh? Doesn't seem so bad. Dear God, this place is nightmarish. Look at the offensive way they draw Jewish people. It's here. The uranium lab is in here. - Where'd you get that thing? - Up your ass. - What? - What? Hey, fellas, you want to get a free caricature? - Yeah. - I want to be a skateboarder. There's something on here. Huh, that's weird. All right, come on. Let's get inside that lab. - Hey, guys. Hitler! How's it going, Mr. Hitler? Oh, it's a dog-eat-dog Reich and I'm wearing bacon pants. - So how's the atomic bomb coming? - It's coming. It's coming. There are problems. We're having better luck developing this impressive collection of 100 luftballons. Oh, damn. I guess we'll just let you get back to work. Oh, I almost forgot. I don't suppose you boys have uranium I could borrow? Oh, of course. Give him some uranium, Mean Joe Green. Hey, kid. Catch. Thanks, Mean Joe. - He's not really mean at all. - No, he's a nice guy. Okay, the time machine is refueled. Let's find a safe spot and make the trip back home. Arrest him! Arrest those three! These filth are making a mockery of our Reich. Execute them! - Unless - Unless what? Unless they can sing a charming musical number. Whenever Damn it, will you two just get in the fucking time machine? We did it. We're home. Everything's fine. - Uh Well, not quite. - What do you mean? Aren't you nervous Mort knows all about this stuff? Oh, I'm one step ahead of you, Brian. See, we've arrived 30 seconds before Mort came up to use the bathroom. Only this time, things are gonna play out a bit differently. Can I poop in here? - No. - No. Too late."

                    			You guys are gonna love this spa. They give the best massages. Your whole bodies will feel like Joe's legs. - Wow. - That would be nice for a short period. I tell you, I need this. I've had a really stressful morning. Wait a minute. Doc, are you telling me that it's 8:25? Precisely. - Damn. I'm late for school. Okay, why don't you just get yourself settled up on the table. - I'll give you a minute. - Uh, what am I supposed? - You ready in there? Yup. Oh, ha, ha. You put some fake poo on the floor. Oh, no. Get out. Get out. Scat. Ah. This is more like it. - Is the music okay? - Actually would you mind tuning it to 97. 1? You're listening to The Quiet Storm. Up next, the music of The Isleys Teddy Pendergrass, and right now, here's some Marvin Gaye. Oh, that's what I'm talking about. Oh, this is long overdue. There's nothing like a good suit massage. Focus on the lapels. That's where I carry most of my stress. Okay, here's one. If you were gay and you had to have sex with either John Forsythe or Sean Connery, who would it be? Oh, that's easy. John Forsythe. - Yeah, John Forsythe. - John Forsythe, absolutely. It's funny, I'd also say John Forsythe. I was just curious. Yeah, I mean, Sean Connery is just so Uh-oh. Oh, God. I am so sorry. It's too late. The damage is done. Hey, Chris, you know what I just got? The boxed set of Lord of the Rings. - It's awesome. - Yeah. Remember the giant eagle they rode in the first one that then rescues them at the third one? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Why didn't they fly the eagle to Mordor instead of spending three movies walking there? That's not what it's about, Chris. It's about the quest. I'm not arguing. I'm saying there's a hole in the story. - Did you like the movie? - That's not the point. - Did you like the movie? - Of course, I loved the movie. But look I'm no writer. But if a fat kid like me with one finger up his nose is bumped by it someone would have caught it. So you didn't like the eagle? Well, no, I did, the eagle was majestic and beautiful but sometimes you have to sacrifice spectacle for a coherent storyline. Oh. - Have you ever seen Krull? - No. Yeah, you don't need to see Krull. The best thing you can do for your body after a massage is hot coffee, alcohol and Slim Jims. Oh, Dad, I'm glad you're here. There's something I need to ask you. - What is it, Chris? - Well, um today in gym class, I noticed one of my testicles went up inside my body, and it hasn't come back out yet. And I'm a little scared. Sir, this employee just made a sexual remark to me. No, Dad, I'm really worried. See, look. Is that normal? Ah, ah. Sir. Sir, your employee is exposing himself to me. - But, Dad. - You got a lawsuit on your hands. Okay, look, look. If you'd be willing to forget this happened, I'll give you this gas card. Unlimited free gas for a year. Just because I threatened to sue you? That, and you're not the worst-looking guy who's ever come in here. That's what I wanted to hear. Wow, Peter. A free gas card. This could save us a lot of money. Yeah, everyone except Brian because he bought a Prius. What a dumb-ass. What? What did I miss? Are we laughing at Brian? Ah, Brian, you suck. What the devil is in here? I threw out all your apple juice, Stewie. We're a gas family now. You put gasoline in Stewie's bottle? You damn fool! You're more useless than Aquaman. Help! Somebody help! Rape! Scream all you want. Nobody can hear you out here. I can. Aquaman, help! Hey. Hey. Hey, let her go. Or what? Or Or I don't know, man, but you're You're lucky you're not doing that over here in the ocean or else Or I would stop you. For God's sakes, help! Do something! If you don't like starfish, you're gonna be mad about what I just did. Oh, God! Help! Oh, you're in for it now, buddy. I got, like, five fish coming to help. Oh, oh, here they are. Help! He's hurting me! Maybe you shouldn't have led him on. Peter, what the hell is that? It's a space shuttle, Lois. I figured with unlimited free gas, I could afford to go into space. Why is it every time I open this door you seem to be in some vehicle you've inexplicably acquired? I got this at a NASA auction for next to nothing. They were gonna scrap it because there's some problem. Instead they sold it to me. Simple explanation. I do not want you trying to fly that. You're not even a trained astronaut. Relax, Lois, nothing bad ever happens to space shuttles. Now, stand back. I'm back from space, everybody. You got lucky, Peter. - How was it, Dad? - Oh, mind-boggling, Chris. Barreling around the earth at five miles per second. Watching the sun rise over the Sea of Japan, it's indescribable. I had lots of time to masturbate, which in space, is great. Except, it's like living in a snow globe. Peter, instead of wasting your gas on a series of comedic stunts why don't you use it more constructively? I mean, we could take a family vacation. Yeah, that's a great idea, Mom. Maybe we can go to the island from Lost. No, I don't want to listen to Matthew Fox's heavy breathing. Kate, you don't get it. We are the island. Hand me that paper bag. Jack, that's got my poop in it. I know. I know. It's got a hint of coconut in it. And something else. But that's part of the mystery. Everybody up, we're going on vacation. Car leaves at 6 a. m. Sharp. Oh, fuck! You blow that fucking horn again, I swear to God I will ram that fucking thing up your goddamn ass! All aboard for the Grand Canyon. Oh, I know you're tired, Stewie but you can sleep all you want in the car. Oh, 6 a. m. I shouldn't have stayed up all night listening to Persian radio. Hey, that was Roxette with ""You've Got the Look. "" It's 21:00 and still 27 centigrade out there. Oh, that's hot. If you're cruising along the left side of the road at 120 kilometers per hour in the Shahabi Desert turn up the decibels because it's Shaleb Mami with Zahec Malec on 103.2, the Hoch. What's with all those birds? My tropical bird collection. - Just in case. - Just in case, what? We're not gonna need a dozen tropical birds. Oh, I was not aware that you could see the future, Lois. Can I go ahead and get tomorrow's lottery number? Stupid woman. Peter, you are not putting those birds in the car. Oh, well, then I guess we're not going on vacation. Good, then I'm going back to bed. All right, Peter, you can bring the stupid birds. Yay. You're letting me be myself. All right, everybody, lets go. All right, everybody, off we go. We are gonna have such a great time - Hello. Hey, Peter. What's up? Hey, Quagmire. Just taking the family on vacation. That's good. Hang on. I'm stuck behind some fat ass driving too slow. Come on, stupid. Move it. Hang on, Quagmire. Some jerk behind me is honking his horn. Oh, you should flip him off. Hang on. Some fat ass flipped me off. Hey, up yours, you jerk. Hang on, I gotta kick this guy's ass. Yeah, I gotta kick this guy's ass. I'll call you after the fight. Me too. Good luck in yours. Good luck in yours. Lois. I'm awake, Lois. Lois! Lois? Where the devil is everyone? This place is more deserted than James Gandolfini's workout room. Just waiting for my breakfast. Lois! I know how to get her attention. Lois, I'm about to drink my first soda. Better come stop me. Mmm. That must be the sugar. Oh, God, that's good. Rupert, suddenly I want to run. Chase me. Oh, now I'm sad. Brian, do me a favor and check on Stewie. - Would you? - He's fine. Hey, what do you say we sing a driving song? That was good. That was good. Chris, you were a little early at the start of bar four. - How did that sound from your end? - Sounded great. You want another? - Lf that works, we're fine. - All good on my end. All right. That's a take. There's no sign of them anywhere. Meg. Chris. Brian. They're gone. I'm all alone. I can do whatever I want. Heh, heh, I'm gonna take Brian's novel and replace every use of the word ""and"" with the word ""fart. "" ""The young soldier fart his brother looked at each other. Fart both knew that with love fart truth fart courage they would both emerge st-farting on their feet. "" That one didn't work. Let's see what fascinating pubescent treasures Chris has got hidden away. Ooh, Hustler magazine. I finally get to see what a vagina looks Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You can't hurt anyone anymore. Why New York? I thought we were going to the Grand Canyon. Well, I just thought we should stop and pay our respects. Ground Zero. So this is where the first guy got AIDS. Peter, this is the site of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. - Oh, so Saddam Hussein did this? - No. - The Iraqi Army? - No. - Some guys from Iraq? - No. That lady who visited Iraq one time? Iraq had nothing to do with this. It was Saudi Arabians, Lebanese and Egyptians financed by a Saudi Arabian guy in Afghanistan and sheltered by Pakistanis. So you're saying we need to invade Iran? Wake up, Stewie. Let's get you out of that seat and into a fresh diaper. Oh, my God. Peter, Stewie's not in the car. Oh, my God, We must've left him at home. Oh, my God. That is hilarious. He is probably freaking out. God, I would give anything to see his face right now. He's probably all like Where? Where the deuce is everyone? I can't really do a good Stewie. Oh, my God. What kind of a mother am I? Peter, we gotta go home right now. Great, Lois, now we gotta bail on the whole vacation. This sucks. Now every time I come back to this place it's gonna be associated with one particular bad memory. We could call Quagmire and Cleveland. They can go and check on Stewie. They'd look after him till we got home. Well, okay, I guess so. Quagmire and Cleveland are great with kids. Like Robin Williams in Patch Adams. Huh. Everybody's lying around in here. Liar, liar, pants on fire. What am I, in Congress? Ha-ha. See, laughter is the best medicine. Please, sir, I'm in so much pain. Shut up and listen to my material. Huh, what's this? Bedpan. Peter Pan. Next stop is Neverland. Come, Wendy, fly with me. Ha-ha. Hmm. I've never executed a diaper change before. How hard can it be? You just unfasten these things. Then lay back with your legs in the air and let nature do the rest. Hmm. It's still there. Usually, the doody has disappeared by now, but it hasn't. It's just sitting there like Joseph on his wedding night. Happiest night of my life, honey. Really memorable. - Almost done in there, God? Shut up. Intruders. Stewie, you in there? You think he's here? Oh, God. It's Cleveland and Bob Hope. The damage is done. Better get them out of here. I'll shackle them in the basement with a 24-hour broadcast of the DirecTV Help channel. What the hell? Where are we? Getting to know your remote is easier than you might think. These buttons at the top control volume, channel and the power on your receiver. To see what else is playing, press ""guide"" and scroll through the menu by pushing the arrow button. Or to scroll even faster use the channel up or channel down button. Now you're on your way to experiencing all that Direc TV has to offer. - Now we've learned the basics - This may be messed up. But am I the only one getting a boner right now? Is there anything that doesn't give you a boner, Glenn? People who use ""rubbish"" when they mean garbage. - Really? - Yup, not even a wiggle down there. Your shows will appear on my playlist. Peter, it's been eight hours and I haven't heard back from Cleveland or Quagmire. I even tried Joe. This is my wheelchair. There are many like it. But this one is mine. Without me, my wheelchair is useless. Without my wheelchair, I am useless. - Shut up. - Okay. Oh, this sucks. I wanna see the Grand Canyon. I'm sorry, but we are not leaving Stewie by himself. We're going home. No way, those guys have a TV in their car. Heh, heh. They're watching Operation: Dumbo Screw with Don Knotts. You've got to impregnate this elephant or the entire species will become extinct. You mean I gotta put this thing in that thing? Well, this is a job that's not worth the money. Peter, watch the road. Lois, get off my back. I'm trying to watch TV. I swear to God, I think your head's screwed on backwards. I mean, do you have any idea Hey, crashie, what are you doing down there? Well, Rupert, we're out of food, diapers, and just about everything else. Which means I've got to get a job. Otherwise, we'll be in worse shape than Morbidly Obese Albert. Morbidly Obese Albert, we brought you some chocolates. Oh, I can't eat those chocolates on account of my diabetes. Remember, they had to take my foot? Look on the bright side. Now you get your shoes half price. Ha, ha, ha. All right, maybe I'll have one. Welcome to McBurgertown. Can I take your order? You've gotta clean the bathroom. No, no. I'm not going back in there. I'm not giving you a choice. You've gotta go clean that up. No. No. It was literally only on the floor. There was no attempt to get near the toilet. It's like they just pressed their buttocks against the wall. The only part of the floor that didn't have poo was the part that had a baby on it. - Go! - Peter, did you get the train tickets? - Actually, no, Lois. There was a guy selling shower curtain rings. So I bought a bunch. Peter, that was the last of our cash. These ones have helium so they are very light. You are unbelievable. The last 4 days have been a living hell. Our baby is at home all by himself. Yet instead of getting us home, you've managed to make things worse. A monkey would be a refreshing step up from you. A monkey would talk less. Here's a tip. If your instinct tells you to do something, don't! If your instinct tells you not to do something it's probably the right thing to do. You wanna hurt me? Go ahead, if it makes you feel any better. I'm an easy target. Yeah, you're right. I talk too much. I also listen too much. I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you. But I don't like to hurt people's feelings. Well, you think what you want about me. I'm not changing. I like I like me. My kids like me. My friends like me. Because I'm the real article. What you see is what you get. Ha, ha, ha. Movie references. Guys, I found us a ride to Quahog in the back of a truck. Hurry! Oh, thank God. Let's head home before Stewie gets hurt. Like Fozzie Bear when he went to Saudi Arabia. It's good to worship Allah because I used to worship some-ah! Wokka, wokka. I once knew a guy who was so Arab How Arab was he? Uh, he was so Arab that everybody liked him and there was nothing funny about him at all. Can I see you in my office for a second? - Yeah. What's up, Eric, everything okay? - Yeah, just come into my office. Stewie, Shawanda said she saw you sneaking food. What? She said she saw you in the kitchen sneaking a fish sandwich. Oh, come on, dude. Yes, okay. But the thing was five minutes past the throw-out time. Well, be that as it may, Shawanda took these pictures on her cell phone. You're fired. We're broke, Rupert. I'm jobless. There's no food left. I'm out of diapers. And I'm down to Meg's last hat. We're doomed, you know. Let it be written on my tombstone that my life was considerably better with my family around. And I didn't realize it until it was too late. Mommy. Daddy. Chris. Dog. Brian. They're home. Oh, Mommy, thank God, you're home. Oh, Stewie, my baby. I promise with all my heart that I'll never say or do anything bad to you for the rest of the evening. By the way, I disabled the V-chip, and I watched so much porn. Oh, sweetie, I'm so glad you're all right. No thanks to Cleveland and Quagmire. Wonder what happened to them? You're ready to enjoy the full range of exciting DirecTV programming options. For answers to any questions you may have you can consult the onscreen help menu or 24-hour online assistance So sit back and enjoy DirecTV. Thanks for joining us.

                    			We now return to Jackass. Hello. My name's Johnny Knoxville and I'm gonna take a shotgun blast to the face. Okay, ready? God. These guys are hilarious. They do so much funny stuff. Hey, you know what? We should try some of that stuff here at home. I don't know. That skull-and-crossbones warning before the show was pretty clear about not doing that. Cleveland, shut up. I saw something on TV that I wanna imitate. Peter, what are you? What are you boys doing up there? Get off the roof. Go back in the house, Lois. We're being Jackass. Ready? We're rolling. I'm Peter Griffin, and this is Shopping-Cart Roof Roof-Shopping-Cart Guys. Okay, go. Ow. Ow. Ow. - My God. - Oh, my God. Are you okay? I don't know. I don't know. What does it look like? What do I do? What do? Aah. What is that? What is that? I feel something. It's your spine, dude. It got, like, yanked up a bunch of notches. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scare - Aah! Oh, God! - Does this get fixed with ice or heat? Ice now, heat later. I'm Glenn Quagmire, and this is Bee Bush. All right, what'd you do to yourself, Quagmire? Well, I just covered my entire private area with honey. Now we're just waiting for the bees. Heh. - Giggity. - All right, here they come. Heh. Okay. Okay, they're on there. Let's just Just Nobody move. All right? Nobody do nothing. Just Don't wanna make them mad. Ha-ha-ha. - Stop it. Stop it. Knock it off. We wouldn't want the bees to get mad. I hate you, bees. - I hate you, bees. - Oh, stop it. - I hate you, bees. - Knock it off. I'm serious. Stop. - I hate you, bees. - Stop. That's enough. Just get them off. Put them back in the hive. Yeah, enough is enough. Cleveland, open the hive. All right, Quagmire, bring them over here. Oh, my. Aah! What the fuck? Why would you do that? Hey, you guys, Lois says it's time for dinner. Peter, this is not safe at all. - Shut up, Brian. Just keep filming. I'm Peter Griffin, and I am the Greatest American Hero. My special power is being somehow memorable after a very short run on TV. - Get some, Peter! - Nice job on that ramp, Joe. - Lf there's one thing I know, it's ramps. - Wait, guys, I think he's really hurt. Help! Help! I think my arm is broken! Ow! My back. I can't move. I thought I was gonna die. Aah! Yeah. Yeah, that's good. You know, I'd expect this kind of behavior from you but you have no business endangering Brian like that. - Thank you. - He jumped into that lake to try and save your life, and he's 8 years old, Peter. - Eight. That's 56 in human years. - Okay, Lois. I mean, why do you think he almost drowned? He's old, Peter. Plus, he drinks and he smokes all the time. So take that 56 and make it 79, at least. Why are you making such a big deal out of this? I was just tired. That's how it begins. Then the next thing you know I'm making Peter dig a hole, and you're in a pillowcase. You're out of your mind. Brian's young, and I'm gonna prove it to you. Hey, youthful guy. How is your ""bur-usiness"" on this aggressively redonkulous morning? What are you talking about, Peter? Don't you mean, ""'Tis-alking' about, P. Dudey?"" You don't have to be formal with me. I know how you young people talk. Peter, I'm not old, but I'm not that young either. We should sip Bacardi like it's your birthday. What does that mean? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all. - Peter, what are you doing? - Lf movies have taught me anything it's that young people are constantly being antagonized by preppy '80s bullies. - What? - What are you gonna do about it? - Peter, this doesn't make sense. - You know what doesn't make sense? Some new-kid jerk moving into my town and being worse than me at karate. - Peter, you don't know karate. - Stay away from Muffy. She's my girlfriend. She just doesn't know it yet. Excuse me, I gotta go get yelled at by my father because we're more alike than we know. - Peter, did you have fun with Brian? - No, Lois, he was a wet blanket. And I'm starting to think you might be right. Brian's getting old. He's not the dog he used to be, and I'll have to get used to it. Just like I got used to my acrylic nails. Stanion, Winestock and Riesman. Hey, LaRonda. No, I got four people on hold, but I can talk. Good morning, everybody. Brian, I have something to say. I'm sorry I've been so preoccupied with your age. Well, look, Peter, don't worry. Let's just forget about it. Fantastic. And to help us forget about it, family I'd like to introduce New Brian. Hey, gang. Whose leg do you have to hump to get a hug around here? Oh, I like him. - You got a new dog? - Yes, sir. - But I'm the dog. - Well, now that you're getting older New Brian's here to take some of the load off. - Can he do tricks? - Oh, you bet. He's trained to fetch, roll over, and make you feel really good about yourself. Wow, Meg and Chris. I can't decide which one of your hats I like better. I can't believe you got a new dog. What about me? Hey, you're still my buddy. New Brian is just a new friend for the family. You guys are gonna get along better than Abraham Lincoln and his neighbor. Hey, Dale, I noticed your lawn's getting a little high. Yeah. I used to have a guy for that, dick. Okay, now, you have a good one. My word, what a gorgeous way to wake up. I hope you don't mind. I checked the time your alarm was set for, and I shut it off. I figured this might be a more gentle way to start the day. Oh, that is so thoughtful, New Brian. I'll start up again in nine minutes. Hey, Meg. I know how you like to let off steam once in a while. - So I got you a journal. - You got me a journal? Actually, I got you two of them: My right ear and my left ear. Fire away. Dear diary: Today, at the school library, I saw a picture in National Geographic of a woman with nipples that cover most of her breasts too. - And suddenly, I didn't feel so alone. - You know what it sounds like to me? Sounds like the woman in that picture was pretty beautiful. All right, I'll see you at dinner. - Think fast. - Wow, deodorant. - Are you sure I'm old enough? - Oh, I think so. I'm gonna make you a little less gross every day. - Hey, New Brian. Oh, you have a guitar. - Yep. In fact, I wrote a new song today, and I wanna hear what you think of it. Where did you find the time for that? Peter, inspiration doesn't have a schedule. I don't like fancy learning books I don't like apple tarts I don't like cozy breakfast nooks I don't like modern arts Well, I like farts Ah! Yes, I like farts I like long farts, short farts Wet farts, your farts I like farts - If you've got heart - Oh, I've got heart - Let's hear those farts - How do I start? Well, Peter I will help you get your farting started Brian, I went out for a run this morning, and I found this stick. - I thought you might like it. - Wow, thanks a lot. And I got you this bag of weed. I don't smoke it myself, but I sure won't judge you. - Gosh, thanks. - Check you later, handsome guy. Well, I wasn't sure about this new-dog thing at first but I gotta tell you, he's a really terrific guy. You poor damn fool. - What? - You have no idea what's going on here. He's not just a delightful new friend for the family. - He's your replacement. - Oh, come on, that's ridiculous. You're getting old, and they know it. You're no longer the cover girl. Look at Carol Alt. That's what You're Carol Alt. - I'm through listening to you. - Fine. Think what you want, aging supermodel Carol Alt. Carol, come in here. They're saying your name on the Family Man. What? Huh? - What? - Huh? - What? I forget. And besides, Brian, the evidence is all right in front of your nose. Ha-ha-ha. That's hilarious, New Brian. Now do your impression of Punky Brewster's father. Punky. - Oh, Punky. - Ha-ha-ha! Oh, Punky, you have a dog named Brandon. ""Hi. I'm Carol Alt for PoliGrip. "" They did it again. Who? - The Family Man. Is that the one with the fish? - No, that's American Boy!. Okay. Relax, Brian. There's no way they'd replace you. But it couldn't hurt to remind them how much they value you as a family member. - Hey, buddy. - Uh - Hey. - I just wanted to check in with you. You know, sometimes life happens so fast we miss the most important part, which is sharing it. - Uh-huh. - You see, Chris, I care about you. And if there's ever anything you ever wanna talk about or if you just want some company, I'm here for you. - So how's it hanging? - Uh - Okay. - Hey, what do you got here? Oh, Maxim. That Jessica Biel sure is a cutie. You were masturbating when I came in. Yeah. - So how's it hang? - Get out! Gotcha. Okay, everybody, tonight, I've got a real treat for you. We've all seen your compilation video, Brian: Shatner singing ""Rocket Man,"" drunk Orson Welles doing that commercial Sylvester Stallone in that porno, and Bill Cosby beating up that midget. - I don't remember that last one. - It's freaking brutal. For no reason, you know? Poor guy's sitting there eating his Snack Pack. Bill Cosby runs in out of nowhere and starts wailing on him. Didn't that guy die? These are home movies from when I was a puppy. - He died. - Okay, look, just watch. Aww Oh, look at him sleep. Oh, I wonder what he's dreaming about. Shut up, Meg. Oh, did you hear that? - He farted. - Just like in the song. Aah! What the hell is the matter with you? Outside. Outside now. Well, I hate to say I told you so, but Wait a minute, I love saying I told you so. Ha. Doy. Ha. "" Hey, Stewie Griffin, meet Stewie Griffin. "" Ha. ""Nice to meet you. "" ""Charmed, I'm sure. "" ""Great outfit. "" ""Oh, go on. "" ""No, it is. "" So what if there's a new dog? Lots of families have two dogs. I thought maybe we could spend the afternoon together. - Really? That'd be great. - Awesome. - Because, uh, I got this new gun. - Here we go. I thought we could go deep in the woods where no one would ever think to look. Oh, boy. - And, uh, just shoot it. - Awkward. You know, like so far in that no one can hear gunfire. - A little on the nose. - Or screaming. Uh I don't think so, Peter. It's like he thinks I'm gonna shoot him. He's acting all crazy, like Quagmire when he drunk-dials me. - Hello? Hey. What are you doing? - Quagmire, I'm sleeping. - Yeah, I was just out with Joe. - What are you doing? - I just told you. Oh, that's right. I just asked that. I forgot. Hey. Hey, this song made me think of you. So li Wait. Listen to this song. Isn't that awesome? You said you weren't gonna call him. It's not him, you big bully. Joe told me not to call you. So, what are you doing? Everyone, I have an announcement to make. - I've decided I'm leaving. - What? Leaving? Brian, why? Well, you know, I feel like I've sort of run my course here. And, you know, besides, there's a whole big world out there and it's time I saw it. But, Brian, you live here. This is your home. I know, but I've thought about this long and hard, and Ha-ha-ha. ""Long and hard. "" I'm sorry, Brian. Please, please, continue. - This is just something I have to do. - Well, where will you go? Well, I haven't decided that yet, but I promise I'll be in touch. - Ha-ha-ha. - Wait, how is that one dirty? It's I was remembering ""long and hard. "" Well, if your mind is made up about this, Brian, then I wish you the best of luck. I hope this move won't be a boner for you. - Peter? - Hmm? - What? - I was just saying to Brian: - ""I hope this move won't be a boner. "" - I would agree. - I hope he finds what he's looking for. - Okay. Well, we're gonna miss you, Brian. Hey, everybody, let's watch this tape. Okay. There's the midget just sitting there. Watch the left side of the screen. I'm in a bad mood, and I'm gonna take it out on you. Oh, my God. Well, he's obviously drunk. Ow! Ow! You're hurting me. About which I do not care very much. - Pancake? - Oh, just a small one, thanks. Mm. My God, these are the best pancakes I've ever had. And I've been to IHOP. These are the best pancakes I've ever had. And I've been to Applebee's. These are the best pancakes I've ever had. And I've been to Denny's. These pancakes are okay. Oh, boy. I bet Brian would love these pancakes. - I wonder where he is. - He's next door with Cleveland. I saw him on my morning paper route. I appreciate you letting me stay with you but I'm perfectly capable of going to the bathroom by myself. Sorry, but there's a leash law in this neighborhood and you never know who's watching. I'm watching you make stool. Hey, New Brian. Oh, I see you're having pie. You know, pie isn't really pie without Cool Whip. Everything's better with Cool Whip. - Did you hear what I said? - What about it? It doesn't bother you the way I pronounce it? ""Cool Whip""? - No. Why would it? - Cool Whip. - I'm putting emphasis on the H. - Sounds right to me. - Nothing ever bothers you, does it? - No, not really. I like everything. God, he's a bigger buzz kill than Buzz Killington. Stewie, do you know why W.S. Gilbert was frequently drunk on his transatlantic crossings? No. Because he was quartered on the portside. Now that I've got you let's both revisit the birth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Two, three. - Okay, New Brian, you're next. - Ha-ha-ha. Oh, no. Oh, boy. All right. Well, I can't do this alone. Lois, I'm gonna need your help here. Oh, my God. Uh-oh. Okay. Rita Coolidge's less-talented sister here. In what way is that a joke? - Okay. You start. - Okay. All right. I don't know Am I blue or am I red? - You're blue. You're blue. - This is crazy. Okay, I'll do it, then. Thanks for letting me stay here. - I hope I'm not in the way. - No, no. Should be fine. Um But, uh, listen, Brian I'm gonna be bringing a Puerto Rican girl over here later and she's super hot and real nice. But when she was 5 years old her dad ran over one of her legs with his van and it's still kind of messed up in a pretty obvious, instantly visible way. Um Please don't say anything. And try to make eye contact with her when she wobbles in because I want this to work. - Uh Yeah, sure. No problem. I'm serious, Brian, that leg is a train wreck. I mean, she herself is so pretty but that thing just looks like a string of sausages with one empty casing in it. - I get it. - It's quite a sight, you know? When she's not looking, you should take a look at it, but be discreet. Yeah, I'll, uh I'll check that out. - Stewie, what are you doing here? - Brian, you gotta come back. - Why? - Because New Brian is such a tool. I mean, he's so damn sweet and saccharine and perfect and he's turning the family into a bunch of douches. Well, big deal. You always told me I was a douche. Yeah. But you were my douche, Brian. My douche. Come back and be my douche again. - Hi. I'm looking for Glenn. - Oh, what happened to your leg?! Damn it, Brian. Come back home, Brian. When this is all over, I'll make you some pie with a nice dollop of Cool Whip. There it is again. Why are you putting so much emphasis on the H? That's exactly why I miss you, Brian. Forget it. I'm not going back as long as that new dog is there. As long as he's a part of that family, there's no place for me. Well, I can't say I blame you. I hate him as much as you do, Brian. He's a bad fit. Like a crocodile at an alligator rally. Yeah, lurking in the water with our eyes poking out. Yeah. Sneaking up on a crane or an egret and snapping our jaws on it. Yeah. And sometimes walking out onto a dry plain or dusty field because it's nice to get out of the swamp now and then. - Yeah - Wait. - What? - What? Huh? Dry plain? Dusty field? Nice to get out of the swamp? What a croc. And that's where we get the term. Hey, New Brian. Bad news. You gotta leave. Huh? What are you talking about? This is my home. Nobody likes you here. Well, I disagree. I think everybody likes me. No, we don't. We don't like your cooking, your stupid karaoke nights and we especially don't like the way you hump that chair in the den. Well, Rupert seems to like my humping. - What did you say? - Rupert. Humped him for two hours yesterday. He just laid there and took it. - Did he? - Yeah. And now every time you're sleeping with him, he's gonna be thinking of me. ""And that is why I killed myself, chopped myself up and put myself in the garbage. "" - Wow, he must've had some demons. - Oh, my God. Suicide? How could we have misjudged him so severely? Oftentimes it's the ones who seem the happiest. Well, the upside is, at least we have our old Brian back. From now on, buddy, you're the only animal I care about. Hey, everybody. I'm Bernie the Hamster. - Would you like to be my friend? - Oh, my G It's okay, Peter. Yay! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It's a hamster. We'll talk about it when you want to talk about it. I don't blame you. I I don't blame you."

                    			Griffin, I need you to run these shipping reports upstairs to the CEO. Huh. There's nothing fun or entertaining about that. Maybe if I walk down the hall with a wisecracking rabbi. - Do you charge a lot for circumcisions? - No, I just keep the tips. All right, where's the CEO's office? Yeah, I've always wanted to see the inside of the executive bathroom. - Executive bathroom, sir? - Uh - Yes? - Right this way. So, uh, where is this executive bathroom? There. Welcome to Executive Bathroom Island. Well, this is peaceful. Good morning, Lois. Wow, Peter, since when do you get so dressed up for work? Since I got tired of getting nowhere in this world, Lois. I've decided to do whatever it takes to become an executive. It would certainly be great if you got a promotion. You'd earn more money, get better health insurance. Lois, I am doing this for the bathroom. And I'm not giving up on my dream, like I did with that indoor hot-air balloon. And away we go. No, no, no! I can't feel my legs. Welcome to the party, pal. - No, wait. There they are. Aww Boy, it sure is great to have you back in town. Yeah, but this place is dead. I don't know. That guy seemed to like it. I like everything, including ginger ale. Psst. That's my way of ordering a ginger ale. Sorry I can't pay you more, but business has been bad. I'm looking to sell the joint. You can't sell this place. So few clubs play real music anymore. Wanna buy it? I'll give you a good deal. - You know, that's not a bad idea. - We could really turn this place around. It could be bigger than the Apollo Theater. All right, now. Next up we got the comedy stylings of Kim Lee Sung. Give it up. How you doing tonight? Ever notice when two black guy come in your convenience store one go one way and one go the other way? What they doing? What they stealing? Who with me? You stay out my store. All you, stay out my store. I remember you face. Peter, I want you to retype those Wow, what is this? Have you been cleaning? I'm working hard so you'll promote me. Based on your record, you'll understand if I have trouble believing you. Believe it, Angela. I hate being just a cog around here. Almost as much as I hate homeless people asking me for money. - Spare some change? - Sure. - You didn't put anything in there. - Yes, I did. I put hope in there. Hope. Don't spend it all in one place, raggie. Griffin, what the hell is this? It's a robot that I built to save this company money. Now, before you say anything, one, it has no human emotions. And two, its prime directive is never to harm people. Oh. Oh, God. It's harming people. Angry. Angry. Oh, God. It's got human emotions too. Aah! It's using tools. It's learning, Angela. It's learning. Run! What do you want, Griffin? Look out your window. See that Anheuser-Busch billboard next to the children's hospital? Well, watch this. Oh, God. Oh, my God. This is horrible. Oh, God. Oh, that's terrible. Oh, good Lord, save them. Bless their lit Oh, okay, okay, yeah. Here we go. All right, everything worked out. We now return to Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio in The Detarded. You're under arrest. No, you're under arrest. Stewie, guess what. Frank and I just closed a deal to buy the Quahog Cabana Club. Oh, wow, Brian, what else are you doing that's terrible and stupid? Just wait. In a few weeks, that club will be the hottest spot in Quahog. Huh. You're deluding yourself. You're gonna fail faster than John Madden's wedding-video business. Boom, here's your groom over here. Boom, you got your bride right here. A lot of people say that Stacy's no good and that she slept with this guy, and done that guy and even did some handwork on this guy. I'll tell you, that is gonna work in her favor late in the game. You know who had a heck of a wedding? Brett Favre. Griffin, I've got good news. A management position has become available. And I've seen that you've been working very hard lately. I am recommending you for a promotion. - I get to use the executive bathroom? - Of course. Holy crap. You know, last week I ate a fortune cookie that said: ""Obvious lesbian will bring great news. "" It also said a grand piano will fall on me. Well, good day to you. And I will, um Uh, yeah. I mean, we're done. Just, uh, squeeze by you here. Is this where I get the poop pass to use the executive bathroom? Sit down. We need to talk. Well, make it fast, because I'm starting to crown. Mr. Griffin, all our executives require a high school education. And your file says that you never passed the third grade. If you want this, you'll have to go back and finish. Well, that sounds hilarious, but it also might take a while. I'm afraid that's your only option. Well, I mean, if that's what I gotta do, then I guess I Next time you get a fortune cookie, don't open it. Bye, you guys. Have fun at school. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, Peter, stop pouting. All you gotta do is finish third grade and you'll get that promotion. Oh This is gonna be a bigger pain than getting into a last-clap contest with Cleveland. Ladies and gentlemen, the Quahog Men's Chorus. Hey, hey, hey. Clap one more time, you're not coming to my birthday. - Who did that? Giggity. Good morning, class. Starting today, we have a new student. Peter, would you like to introduce yourself? Hi, my name's Peter Griffin. Um I was actually in third grade a long time ago, but I never finished. Back then we had a teacher named Mrs. Wilson. Ha-ha. Except we had this funny little nickname for her. We called her ""Mrs. Kill-Son"" because she had an abortion. I know it's kind of silly, but we were just a bunch of kids. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Mrs., uh? Wilson. Thank you, Peter. Why don't you sit over there next to Omar? Omar is our top student. And we're hoping he'll lead us to victory next week in the district spelling bee. What are you doing? You're old. Are you stupid or something? Oh, picking on the new kid, huh? Well, at least my parents didn't name me ""Gaymar. "" Wow. I never knew you could make fun of someone for being homosexual. And by laughing at other people's sexuality somehow I feel better about my own. Brian, where are all the people? They'll be here. We gotta give them time. And wouldn't you know it? There's our first customer. I'll entertain him while we wait for more to arrive. So thanks for coming. How you doing tonight? Good. Glad to hear it. Any requests? Play ""On the Dark Side"" by John Cafferty and the Beaver Brown Band. Give it up, Brian. No one wants to go to a stupid big-band club anymore. I could help make some changes around here that would bring in customers. You know, we should give Stewie a shot. It can't hurt. Well, what did you have in mind? Just trust me. I know exactly what to do. You've gotta be aggressive. More aggressive than Michael Jackson's treatment of his own groin onstage. Hee-hee. Thank you. All right, Susie. What have you brought in for show-and-tell? This is my Malibu Barbie doll that I got for Christmas this year. She comes with a hairbrush, a pocketbook and two different dresses. Oh, my God. Who the hell cares? Peter, I would like to remind you that you are in a classroom. Not for long. Can I help you, sir? Hi. My name's Glenn Griffin. Uh, I'm here to pick up my son Peter for a ball ga Uh, doctor's appointment. - Peter is your son? - That is affirmative. Because you look a lot more like that child over there. - Daddy? - Oh, God. - Daddy? - Oh, God. - Papá? - Oh, God. - Hey, there are no kids in here, right? - No. Just me. Oh, thank God. You wanna have unprotected sex? Hmm What the hell did Stewie do to this place? Hey, get a load of Maynard G. Krebs over here. He's rubbing the records with his hand. Hey, hey. You're gonna ruin that, you know. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you a name. Here, take some of these for your 45s. You can't play your 45s without these little yellow things. What'll they make you buy next? Hey, hey. There they are. Stewie, what is all this? What did you do to the Cabana Club? Oh, we don't call it the Cabana Club anymore, Frank. It's now called pLace. Little P, big L. Congratulations. You two now own the hottest spot in town. Wow, that's a lot of people. I hope we have enough rye. How'd you pay for all this? I got a job as a field reporter for Channel 5 News. All the juice is collected underneath? Yes. And whoever collects the most is gonna win a free weekend here with international foods and wine tasting. Stop. Oho Oof! Oh! Ow, ow, ow! Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Ow, ow, ow. Ooh. Oh, gosh. I hope he's all right. We'll have to send someone to make sure that he is. - Hey, Omar, want a Hertz doughnut? - Um Okay. Hurts, don't it? Ha-ha-ha. Dumb-ass. Wow, he effectively silenced Omar by hitting him in the face. My dad hits me. But I bet if I hit others, the pain stops. Someday, I'll use what I've learned here on my wife. Peter, is this your homework? Hold on. Let me take out my reading glasses. Ha-ha-ha. Yeah, that's mine. I could flunk you for this. But ""buttlickers"" is a three-syllable word. Not even Omar can spell those. So you're joining him at next week's district spelling bee. If you lead our school to victory I'll let you pass third grade. But if you lose, you fail. I accept that challenge. Late '70s Bruce Jenner, take me home. Hop on, Peter. Brian, how does it feel to own the coolest club in Quahog? You think this is cool? Look at these people. I'd rather go bankrupt than cater to jerks like this. Whoa, Brian. Slow down, man. We're making money now. And besides, this place ain't all bad. Hey, you girls thirsty? Could I interest you in a couple of Rob Roys? - What's a Rob Roy? - Only the drink of Mr. Peter Lawford. Who's Peter Lawford? What am I hitting on, Lou Costello here? Who's Lou Costello? Uh, sorry, my friend's a little new to the club scene. Jeez, what the hell's with these broads? Look at you two. Tuxes in a nightclub? You're more out of place than Prince was on The Price Is Right. And what's your bid on the dining-room set, Prince? Three-fifty. - I'm sorry? - Three-fif - Can you speak up, please? Three-fifty. All right. And the actual retail price of the dining-room set is $350. Yay. - Peter, wake up. - Huh? Wha? Oh. Oh. Oh, Lois. I just had the weirdest dream. Lewis Black told jokes that were so funny he had to shout them so everyone could hear. Peter, you gotta stay awake. The spelling bee's tomorrow. But, Lois, I'm scared. There's no way I can compete against those kids. It's like trying to beat Schpupel champion Fjurg van der Ploeg at a game of Schpupel. Schpupel. Don't be sad, Peter. That's why they call it Schpupel. God, we look like idiots. Hey, hey. That's more like it. Where'd you get the threads? We went to Barneys. I heard that's where all the people shop for skinny-leg jeans. Whoa, these are the tightest, penis-compressingest sperm-killingest, testicle-grippingest jeans I ever tried on. Brian, Frank, meet Dakota and New Bedford. Hey, how's it hanging, Dakota? What's up, New Bedford? You look like rappers, but you're not black. So that's the perfect amount of danger. Listen, you guys get to know each other. Looks like my doorman let another gazelle in here. Sorry, but we've been over this before. - We don't serve your kind here. - You're gonna hear from my lawyer. Yeah? I would welcome that. I would welcome the opportunity to hear from a lawyer that represents a gazelle. What's his name? Yeah, I don't have a lawyer. I'll tell you about Dean Martin. He was the only guy on the golf course who had a 5-iron with a cork on the end of it. So, uh, who wants to come back to the hotel and take a whack at my genitals? - Cool. - Awesome. All right, we got a ball game. Hang on, girls. I'll get you a couple of appletinis. This is going great, Frank. This club and these clothes. My God, there's nothing that can stop us. Hey, party people! I'm ready to get eighty-sixed. - Andy Dick? - Oh, no. Come on. Let's get out of here. What the hell just happened? Andy Dick happened. As soon as that guy shows up anyplace it gets a worse rap than John Wilkes Booth. Stupid hat. Damn it. I paid 15 cents for this ticket. Oh! No, he didn't. Christ, could he be any more annoying? Oh, hey, it's Tom. Tommy. Ha-ha-ha. Hey, I hear you took that black chick home. Hey, hey. You're welcome. Our next spelling-bee contestant is Omar Mahajareef Uh Something September 11 th-y. All right, Omar. Your word is ""candy. "" Candy. C-A-N-D-Y. Candy. That's correct. Our next contestant is Peter Griffin. Peter, your word is ""tree. "" Can you use it in a sentence? There is a tree by the lake. Huh. Can you use it in a dirty sentence? I like to bring transient hookers to the oak tree where I asphyxiate myself at the same time I'm watching them have sex. - T-R-E-E. Tree. - Correct. We're down to our final two competitors: Peter Griffin and Omar North Tower. Omar, you'll be going first. Your word is ""coagulate. "" C- O-A-G-A Oh, I'm sorry, Omar. Bet you could spell ""box cutter. "" I'm 9 years old and I'm Indian. All right, Peter. If you spell your next word correctly, you win the competition. Your word is ""lesbians. "" - Can you use it in a sentence? - The two lesbians are going shopping. Use it in a dirty sentence. The two lesbians are going shopping for double-headed marital aids. Damn. Wait! Can you use it in a libelous sentence? Gillian Anderson and Helen Hunt are lesbians. - L-E-S-B-I-A-N-S. - Correct. I did it, Lois. My God, I did it. You sure did, Peter. I'm so proud of you. Way to go, Dad. Yeah, you're a smart fella, Dad. And you're a fart-smeller, Meg. - Aah! - Ha-ha-ha. Let's go home. Angela, I did it. I finished the third grade. I'm ready for my promotion. Griffin, you blew up a children's hospital. - You're going to jail. - What? What, you think everyone just forgot about that? There was an investigation, fingerprints, forensic reports. Nineteen children died, Peter. And the FBI knows it was you. Mr. Griffin, this court finds you guilty and sentences you to seven days in prison. You'll be out next Sunday at 9. God, I can't believe we bought these clothes for a club that didn't even last. Hey, come on. We had a great 72-hour run. In this business, that's all you can ask for. Besides, I've already opened a new club that's even more exclusive than this one. Really? Where is it? Brian, it's so exclusive that it doesn't even have a location. It's in here. Human heart. I think that's a beat we can all dance to. Wow. I weirdly feel a lot better. Hey, Brian, what do you say we sing Stewie some real music? Sounds good to me. On the western side of Quahog If you'd care to come along There's a club that's so exclusive That the line is 10 miles long Where the douche bags come to party And to spend their father's cash Just to take home slutty women And then wake up with a rash Yeah, they wake up Wake up, wake up Wake up with a rash Take me out to pLace tonight Where the wool knit caps are tight And the guys in hooded sweatshirts Have forgotten that they're white Take me out to pLace tonight Where a dude can pick a fight Over who takes home That smoking Chinese bar skank On the right There's a throng of trendy people And they're stretched Around the block And there's one unpleasant deaf guy Who just really shouldn't talk Vodka tonic, please. There's a chick who's kind of Persian And a broad with zero fat And a giant human monkey Oh, no, wait, that's Spencer Pratt Yeah, you're right That's Spencer Pratt Take me out to pLace tonight To a bathroom-stall delight Where a girl will help you empty Every last electrolyte Take me out to pLace tonight Where there ain't no cellulite And we'll drink ourselves insane Until we're feeling Dynamite"

Joe is gonna keep bailing on us until that baby comes out of Bonnie's butt. - Babies come out of the butt, right? - Yeah. We're gonna do something about it. We're gonna induce labor and make Bonnie have that baby. The sooner that kid comes out, the sooner we get Joe back. We're not complete without Joe. Remember when he bailed for that trip to the spa and we had to find another guy? God, Seamus, I've never seen you this naked. It's good to let the old midsection breathe. What, uh? How the hell are you alive? Hey, Peter. How are you? Never mind that, Bonnie. I'm here to induce birth. Follow me. Now I'm gonna put the TV remote down by your feet. I'm gonna turn on Two and a Half Men. If your baby isn't brain-dead, it'll come out to change the channel. And when he does, I'll grab his hand and yank him out of there. - Peter, I don't think - Shh. It's starting. Two and a Half Men was filmed in front of a live ostrich. Boy, this stinks.

Let's go down to The Clam and drink beer and watch sports. - Definitely. - You in, Joe? - Yes, awesome. That would be splendid. This isn't working.

I don't want pregnant mess in my back seat. Come on. You're the guy who soiled his pants while test-driving that sports car. I don't want it. All right, Mrs. Swanson, you're doing fine. Peter, don't you wanna watch? It's a beautiful miracle of nature. I can't look. I didn't look when Lois gave birth, and I can't look now. You can just tell me what it looks like. You ever see a horse blink his eye? Okay, Mrs. Swanson, you're almost there. Push. Push. Get out of there! Get the hell out of my wife, you little bastard! Okay, here we go. Hold on, the wheelchair is coming first. And here's the baby. Congratulations, Mrs. Swanson. It's a beautiful baby girl. Oh, Bonnie, I'm so happy for you. Oh, my God. She's dying. - What? Oh, sorry. I was watching this Paula Poundstone comedy special. Here's your baby. She's beautiful. Isn't she, sweetheart? She sure is, Joe. It's hard to believe she's already 18. Oh, Susie's so cute. I can't wait to have a baby someday. Oh, Meg, we've talked about this. In order to make a baby a man has to be aroused enough to ejaculate. Sorry, Dad, I forgot. That's all right, sweetie. Now, you run along and play in the mud. Attention, everyone. This is a twist-tie. It comes with every loaf of bread. When we're done selecting our piece of bread, we use the tie to preserve Oh, my God. Who is that angel? That's Susie Swanson. You don't say. - You think you have a shot with her? - Are you kidding? We'll go together better than Hannity and Colmes. My problem with liberals, Alan, is that liberals hate America. Sean, I don't know if that's true. You just contradicted me. You hate America. If I could just get a word in You hate America. You like the terrorists. Well, I guess you're right again. - Bonnie, we got a problem. - What's the matter? I'll tell you while we're doing the diaper change. Here's the reality of the situation. I got our hospital bill this morning. How bad is it? It's $20,000. Oh, my God. Where are we gonna get that kind of money? I don't know. We gotta figure that out soon. Well, I'm not worried, Joe. You'll think of something. I gotta tell you. Not being able to pay my child's hospital bills somehow makes me feel like less of a man. Oh, honey, that's silly. I'm gonna show you what a man you really are. Now, let's go put your penis on. We now return to Are You Smarter Than a Hispanic Maid? Okay, Larry. Now, how does a Hispanic maid address her employer if his name is John Sullivan? Is it A, John or B, Mr. Sullivan? I'm gonna go with Mr. Sullivan. Oh, that was a trick question. Consuelo, what would you say? Uh, Mr. John? That's correct. Now, bonus question: Is Mr. John home? Uh, no. No, Mr. John, no home. Joe? What the hell? Are you working here? I have to, Quagmire. The baby's hospital bill drained our savings so I've had no choice but to take this job. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Excuse me, I couldn't help overhear you got yourself some money issues. Uh, yeah, kind of. Well, I might be able to help you out. - How much you need? - Look, I'm a police officer. I can't afford to get mixed up with a loan shark. Listen to this guy. He's flipping a nickel and chewing on a toothpick. Well, I do really need the money. And I don't have credit for a bank loan. Do it. If you work here any longer you're gonna feel smaller than my eye floaters. There's one now. I can never look at it dead-on. It's trying to get away. - Hey, eye floater. - Hi. Hey, hey, where you going? - Away from your pupil. Well, maybe I'll look over here. - I'll go over here. You've got an answer for everything, don't you? Oh, Brian, come here. Mind listening to this song for Susie Swanson and tell me what you think? - Okay. Susie You're a baby That's all I have so far. That was horrible. You're as bad as Beethoven near the end. They're gonna love that. Well, I'm still gonna work on it. - What's it called? - ""Susie. "" Wow, a song named after a girl. - There aren't a million of those already. - Name 20.

"" Go fuck yourself. What am I gonna do, guys? I paid the hospital bill, but now I need $20,000 to pay the loan shark. I'm right back where I started. Well, sounds like we need another loan shark. Don't worry, Joe. We're gonna pitch in and help you raise money. Wow, Peter, I gotta say, this lemonade stand was a really good idea. It's selling really well. That's because it has my secret ingredient in it: Vodka. You know what we should do? You know what we should do? We should just We should just get on our bikes and just go. Just go and start a business. You know, I never to I've never told anyone this. But you're so good at cursing. I don't know, Peter. We've been out here all day and we haven't managed to interest a single woman in our parlor. Wait a minute, here comes somebody. Excuse me, stressed-out lady. May I interest you in a full release, relaxation massage? Oh, yeah. Just what I need: To be rubbed down by big fatty, an old black guy, a cripple and a pervert. Now we don't have any money and our feelings are hurt. That's pretty much it, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Joe's getting desperate, and we haven't raised nearly enough. Is there any way you could help us out? Of course I could. But it's funnier to me if I don't. In about an hour, I'm gonna piss away 20 grand. What, are you gonna bet on the Knicks? Ha-ha-ha. It's I'm sorry. I mean, how often? I mean Oh, man, nobody think that's funny? Oh, my God, she's so hot. Look at that, she can fit that whole bottle in her mouth. All right, Stewie. You can write a song. How hard can it be? You got your G chord right here It's like a cozy house where you live That's where you start your journey Here I am in my house, nice and cozy And then you poke your head Out the door with the C chord Everything looks okay out here Maybe I'll take a walk outside To the D chord Oh, walking around outside Look at all the stuff out here And then we go to an A-minor Getting a little cloudy out here Looking like we might Have some weather Then we go to E-minor Oh, definitely got some weather Things are a little more complicated Than they seemed at first And then we go back to my house You sound like an unbelievable douche. Then Brian comes in And I change up the tempo Brian comes in And it changes the song Looking at me Like he thinks I'm a douche bag But he's gonna learn pretty fast That he's wrong Hey, Brian Why are you bringing me down, man? Why are you bringing me down? Don't bring me down Music and lyrics by Stewie Griffin. Hey, Swanson, the boss is getting impatient. He wants his money. He says after we're done with you, you're gonna be eating Swanson TV TV di - Wait, what did he say? - What? What did the boss say? He said something funny, I'm drawing a blank. Oh, you know what it was? - What? - You know what it was? When we're done with him, he's gonna be a Swanson TV dinner. That is pretty funny. Look what they did to me. My legs are useless now. And trust me, they'll be back. Well, what are we gonna do? You know what, boys? Desperate times call for desperate measures. If that stingy old Carter won't give us the money we need I say we take it from him. Guys, we are gonna plan a robbery. Hey, hey, that's the guy. That's the guy whose chin looks like, uh, balls. On a normal night in the Pewterschmidt mansion there might be as much as $6 million in the vault. But this Saturday is the Pewterschmidt's annual "" Bring All Your Cash And Put It In Our Safe"" party. Considering the guest list, there could be as much as 40 million. But we only need 20,000. Look, I'll be honest with you. My father-in-law has treated me like crap for 20 years, and it's time for a little payback. Forty million dollars. That's 10 million each. I could produce a movie with B-plus stars in a not-so-expensive location. Jeff Bridges and Laura Linney in Danger in Cincinnati. We've got 24 hours before those terrorists set off that bomb that makes an invisible explosion. - What are we gonna do? - Get back to headquarters. - Should we take the helicopter? - No, let's walk. It's a nice day. Oh, there's my laptop. Do you mind? I wanna check my e-mail. Go away. I'm editing this music video I'm making for Susie. Oh, really. Music video? Working on a little video there? Little, uh? Little music video? Little compilation of visual images to go with a song? Little four-minute movie that tells the story? That only works when I do it. There, all done. All right, Brian. Get ready to feel. I'm not following the story arc here. Shut up! Don't worry, Brian. Those goose bumps will go away in about 20 minutes. Stewie, that is the worst thing I have ever seen, ever. And I've seen Peter when he's frozen in sex-face. Peter, would you like more potatoes? Bill, how are you? Babs, come over here and say hi to Bill Gates. - Hello, Mr. Gates. - Hi, Mrs. Pewterschmidt. Well, this is a quaint little party you guys are throwing. Hey, Bill, would you help me program my Zune? Oh, wait. I have an iPod, like the rest of the world. Why, you - All right, Joe, we're here. - All right. Peter, Quagmire start the diversion. Cleveland, find that door. Check. Check. Hey, fellas, knock off all that high-society crap and play some of this. One, two, three, four. Cleveland, you're clear to enter the vault. Copy that. Uh-oh. It's a combination lock. Looks like I'm just gonna have to cut through it. Good thing I brought Reese Witherspoon's chin. This programming brought to you in part by Kobe Brand condoms. The protection you want for the sex she doesn't. Brian, do you know where Peter is? Yeah, he and the guys went to go rob your dad. I believe you. I'm in. Holy crap, there's another door. What do we do now? Welcome to the vault. Voice identification, please? Uh-oh. It's me, Carter. I want my money. Voice print verified. How the hell do you do that? I can do you guys too. Hey, everybody. - Oh, hey, Peter. - No, it's still me. Oh. Welcome to the inner vault. Penile identification required. Let me handle this. That's amazing. How did you match it? Oh, I didn't match the shape. I just stuck it in there and broke it. Final checkpoint. Answer this question: What is the most unattractive male first name in the English language? Keith. Wow, look at this place. There's more dough in here than a Swedish bakery. Look at all my dough. I'm covered in dough. Father, you're covered in dough. Oh, you spoiled the surprise. I'm making you a cake out of dough. All right. Pack up the dough and get out of there. Joe, stop. - Lois, what are you doing here? - I'm here to talk some sense into you. Do you wanna go through with this? I have to, Lois, for my family. I don't know where else to get $20,000. But you know Daddy will find out. He'll put his best people on the job. - And believe me, he'll catch you. - That's a risk I'm willing to take. But think about your beautiful little girl. You can't watch her grow up from jail. You'll miss running after her as she learns to walk. I mean, riding bikes with her as she I mean, dancing at her wedding. Look, my point is, you know what you're doing is wrong. And you know how to make it right. Guys, put the money back and get out of there. What? Are you out of your mind? - Tell him, Megatron. - Do as I command! Okay, okay, jeez. So how'd Susie like your video? I don't care about her anymore. I'm in love with Bryan Adams. Peter, I want you to promise me you'll never do anything that stupid again. Lois, after what you did for Joe, I'll promise you anything. How did you get your dad to give him that 20 grand? I told him it was for me. I said I wanted to hire a divorce lawyer. Yeah, right. You're joking about that, right? Lois? You're joking, right? Lois. Ah, ha-ha."

                    			Step right up. Step right up. You won't believe your eyes. Step right up and see the amazing half man, half clam. What a rip-off. It's just Kim Cattrall sitting Indian style. Boy, they've got some very unusual prizes at the carnival this year. A winner! Congratulations, son. You've won a genuine, live homosexual. Where are we going? Wait! Don't tell me! - Oh, boy! Mom, can I keep him? - Well, it's a big responsibility, Chris. That means you'll have to clean up after him and feed him. - What do you eat? - Attention. - I like your hair. - Still hungry. - You have a beautiful speaking voice. - I'm full. Let's see, I guess 185 pounds. Wrong. I'm 95% helium. - Brian, look what I won. - Wow, what'd you win that for? For having the best pig in the competition. - Wait, you bred a pig? - Sure did. Most genetically perfect one in the contest. Oink. Oh, my God! - Yes. He's something, isn't he? - Are those fists? Damn right. Show him, pig. - How the hell did you do this? - I'll let you in on a little secret, Brian. I didn't do it. I got it from a farm. What the hell kind of farm breeds pigs like this? Would you like to see it for yourself, Brian? - Yeah, I would. - Good. Because it's gonna blow your mind like the stereopticon did to Americans in 1910. Hey, I'm in New York City! No, I'm not. Yes, I am. No, I'm not. Yes, I am! What's going on here? - This is it, Brian. - What's that? It's how I got the pig. You ever heard of the Multiverse Theory, Brian? Of course I have, but I'm wondering if you have. Oh, my God! So transparent. Well, the theory states that there are an infinite number of universes coexisting with ours on parallel dimensional planes. - Dimensional planes, right. - Oh, don't do that. Don't repeat the last two words like you already kind of knew what I was talking about. You have no idea what I'm talking about. Now, in each of these alternate universes, the reality is different than our own. Sometimes only slightly, sometimes quite radically. The point is every possible eventuality exists. And that's where you got the pig, in a parallel universe. Prepare yourself, Brian, and I'll show you. Where are we? This is Quahog, Brian. Same year, same time. But in this universe, Christianity never existed. Which means the Dark Ages of scientific repression never occurred and thus, humanity is - Ergo, muscular, genetically perfect pigs. - Hey, look. There's Quagmire. Thanks, honey. Say hi to your husband. Well, I got AIDS again. Better take my NyQuil Cold, Flu and AIDS. All gone. - What time do you suppose it is, Brian? - I don't know. About 3:30. Watch the sidewalk. My God! Is that Meg? And you know what's amazing? In this universe, she's still one of the ugly ones. If you saw Lois, your penis would shoot right off your body. Come on. I'll show you around. - Hey, is there a bathroom around here? - You need to go pee or poop? - Poop. - One poop removal. - Wow, did I just go poop? - You sure did. All digital. - Where does it go? - It gets beamed to another dimension. Let me ask you this. What about all the Renaissance art that Christianity inspired? That was my first question, too. Come on. Have a look at the Sistine Chapel. Wow. Yep. With no Christianity to inspire Michelangelo, they gave the job to John Hinckley. - All right. You ready to go home now? - Are you kidding? This is amazing. Can we see more universes? Hmm. Well, I haven't tried yet, but I don't see why not. - Whoa! What's this place? - Yeah. This universe looks weird. Yeah, it's cheap and somehow lazy. Yabba dabba - Rock-Peter? - Yes, Rock-Lois? That was wonderful rock-sex we had last rock-night. Yes. I enjoyed rocking you up the rock last night. I know. I must've had four rock-gasms. I'm glad you wore that rock-ring. But we still always use a rock-phylactic. I'm ribbeted for your pleasure. Hey, Brian, want to get the rock out of here? Rock, yeah. Oh, this looks like Spooner St., only something's not quite right. According to the Multiverse Guide, this is a universe where the United States never dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. So the Japanese just never quit. Well, I think I've seen enough. Let's get back to our universe. All right. Off we go. Home sweet home. Peter. Peter. What? What? Can you take out the trash? 'Cause it stinks in the kitchen. - Sure thing, Lois. Delighted to. - I get tired when I stand. What the hell is this? This isn't our universe. Apparently, this is a universe where everyone has two heads. One happy, one sad. - Honey, have you seen Stewie? - I can't find him anywhere. - I sure have! - He's over there playing in the corner. - I want you to know I love you! - I'm trying to get excited about it. This is too freaky. Why didn't that thing take us home? I don't know! I told you, it hasn't been fully tested yet. Well, we can't stay here, that's for sure. And now back to Channel Five News at Six! Quahog's lowest-rated newscast. - The president's dog just had puppies! - There was a plane crash. Stewie, please tell me you know how to get us home. Of course I know how to get us home! What the hell? Stewie, what's going on? From the look of it, I'm guessing this is Quahog but during some sort of ice age. Well, press the button! Get us out of here! - Uh-oh. I can't reach the device. - What? You're kidding! Yep, get comfortable. I think we're gonna be here for a while. Oh, look. There's your poop from the other universe. Stewie, you got to get us out of here. If we stay in here much longer, we're either gonna freeze or starve. I know. But I can't reach the device. You try. You're closer to it. Besides, you're stronger than I am. - Hey, what was that? - Well, you said I was stronger than you. And that must have made me happy, so my tail started wagging. Looks like it carved through the ice a bit. Yeah, it did! Keep going. Okay, let's see. You want to go for a walk? - It's working. Do more! - You want a treat? You want a treat, boy? That's good! That's good! But you really have one, right? - Oh, yeah, yeah. - And we're going for that walk? Oh, yeah, definitely. And I'll give you a bath! - No, no, no! - Sorry, sorry. I'll let you go for a ride in the car! - Oh, you better not be lying! - You want to sleep in the bed with us? Yes! I never get to! It must be a special occasion. - You got it! You're through! - Yes. All right, what do I do? - Just press the red button. - Okay, which one's red? Press the big button! - This can't be it. This doesn't look familiar. - You're right, Brian. Apparently, this is a universe where everyone has to take a poop right just now. - Okay, Bill, you got those numbers? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay, just leave them on my desk. - Okay, that works out fine for me. - Where's your desk? - Doug knows where my desk is. Craig, are you good with this? Yeah, that should work out pretty good for me, too. - What the hell? What's happened to us? - I don't know. But suddenly, I feel all sweet and warm and fuzzy. It seems we're in a universe where everything is drawn by Disney. Look, there's our house! Look how gaily we run! Oh, Stewie and Brian, you're just in time for pie. Did somebody say pie? It's a wonderful day for pie You can ask all the birds in the sky And they'll tell you real sweet With a musical tweet It's a wonderful day for pie - For pie - For pie For pie For pie For pie This is wonderful, Brian. Oh, let's live in this universe. Gosh, it's pretty intoxicating, isn't it? I want to hear more music about pie. It's a wonderful day for pie And it smells a lot better than I - Everyone in the house - And this Adam West mouse - The bees making honey - This Tom Tucker bunny We all sing with glee 'Cause we all agree It's a wonderful, wonderful day for pie You want a nice, shiny red apple to put in that pie? No! Brian, we could spend the rest of our lives here! - It's perfect! - Sounds good to me. Doesn't seem to be a thing wrong with this place. Hello, everybody! Jew! Oh, yeah, I forgot. This is a Disney universe. Oh, but look how shiny my buttons are here! - Just push the - Yeah, okay, okay. I'll push the thing. - Whoa! This is trippy. - I should say so. We're in the Robot Chicken universe. Would you guys move? You're blocking the TV! Look! G.I. Joe, Transformers, ThunderCats, He-Man! Those shows existed! How does it feel to be on a major network for 30 seconds? - Fuck you! - Bye. My God! This place looks terrible. It looks like Quahog was vaporized or something. It says that in this universe, Frank Sinatra was never born. And therefore, he was unable to use his influence to get Kennedy elected. So Nixon won the 1960 election and totally botched the Cuban missile crisis, causing World War III. Wow, so I guess Lee Harvey Oswald never shot Kennedy? No. He shot Mayor McCheese. - That joke's not in bad taste, right? - Oh, who cares? He's a cheeseburger. - Where are we? - I don't know. The device can't make heads or tails of it. It's just some sort of weird, low-resolution, blocky universe. - Lois, where is my supper? - Still in the oven! - Will I have it soon? - Quite soon! - Thank you! - You're welcome! - I'm frightened. - Let's go. - Love it. - Hate it. - Love it. - Hate it. - Brian, this feels weird. - Hit the button! Oh, God, what is this? I feel like I'm on acid or something. According to the Multiverse Guide, this is a universe where everything is depicted as a Washington Post political cartoon. Good Lord, I'm naked! And why am I holding a dinner platter that says ""McCain-Feingold""? That's pretty good. That's funny. - You don't get it. - No, no. I totally get it. Oh, God! Let's go, quick. Here comes an overweight cat with dollar signs for eyes, and a hat that says ""Social Security"" pouring a bucket that says ""Alternative Minimum Tax"" over a sad Statue of Liberty holding a ""Democracy"" umbrella. - Yes! That ought to wake people up! - Shut the fuck up. - Oh, my God! Now we're nowhere! - Not quite, Brian. This is a universe. But its only inhabitant is one really far-away guy who yells compliments. - I like your shirt! - Thank you! This was nice. We did it! We're back! No. This is the universe of misleading portraiture. Oh, wait! It's not so bad. There's the compliment guy. Hello! Oh, they got both of us! We're finished. We're never gonna get home. We're never gonna see our Peter and Lois or anyone else we know ever again. - You got your pal Stewie. - Great. Oh, you could learn something from compliment guy. And, you know, it's not as bad as you think. I may have finally figured this out. I just need to make a few more calculations. Whoa! Sorry about that. Bad girl, Holly. No jumpies! Oh, it's It's quite all right. - Wow, okay, this is ridiculous. - And you go here. You, you naughty little wire, you're supposed to be over here. How did you get over there? Oh, yeah. Come on, Holly. Let's go. This guy's a freak. And that should do it. Now let's go home. Hey! What the hell are you doing? I just don't think we should be too hasty. I mean, we have a unique opportunity to study alternate universes in depth. - Brian, give me the damn device! Give it! - No! - Give it! - Knock it off! No! Stop! Stop it! - Come on, give it! Come on! - Come on! What the hell, man? What the hell? Look what you did! You better put that thing on a leash, sir, or I'm gonna have to fine you. Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty dog! What the hell were you thinking, Brian? We're never gonna get home now! Why the hell would you break the damn device? Look, it was an accident, all right? And besides, look at this place. It's a world run by dogs. I mean, I kind of want to explore this universe. Oh, you like role reversal? Okay. Wait. What are you doing? Come on! - Pick up my poop! Pick up my poop! - I'm not picking up your poop! - Hey, you! Pick up that poop. - You heard him, Brian. Pick up my poop. - Go on. Pick it up. Do it. Pick up my poop! - I need a plastic bag. Here's a thin napkin. Okay, I'm a new neighbor and you're my pet human, Hotchkiss. Got it? I'm not so crazy about Hotchkiss anymore. What do you mean? You came up with Hotchkiss. I know, but how about Axel, or Maximillian, or Dex, you know? It's got to have an ""X"" in it because that means I have cool parents who take me on expensive ski trips on spring break, and I get to drink wine with dinner even though I'm only 14 and Oh, my God! I know that sound! It means there's a potential intruder at the front door or one of my pals! Either way, I'm really excited and ready for anything! - Hello! - Hello. My name is Blake Carrington. Oh! - And this is my human, Gabe. - Oh, no. What? We just moved in down the street and thought we'd stop in and say hi to our new neighbors. Well, great to meet you. Come on in. I'm Peter. This is my family. My wife, Lois. My son, Chris. Chris, stop licking yourself and come up and say hi! My daughter, Meg. Our puppy, Stewie. - And this is our human, Brian. - Nice to meet you. - Say hi to human Brian, Blake, says Gabe. - Hi. Mommy, I want to play with the new human! Only if it's okay with Blake. Yeah, sure. It's fine. Gabe is great with puppies. I swear to God, I hope the next universe we go to is all Koreans. - I know who you are, Stewie. - I beg your pardon? I've perfected multiverse travel as well. In fact, I've figured out how to navigate with absolute precision. Really? I haven't. We've been jumping randomly from one universe to the next. - Did you have the ""shuffle"" button on? - Oh, my God! - There you go. - That's why that little symbol with the two crossed arrows is up there in the corner. - There's your problem. - Oh, my God! I feel silly. But I can't do anything about it. My device has been destroyed. Well, I've got one of my own. I can use it to send you back. Hold on, I'll get it. Oh, my God! Who is it? I got it! - Morning, Peter. - Hey, Joe. Bonnie and I are having company tonight. Wondering if I could borrow some wet food. Yeah, sure thing. That's Joe. He's our local human catcher. So, don't misbehave or the human catcher will come after you, Gabe. My name's not Gabe! - You're in big trouble, you little crap! - You shouldn't have done that, little fellow. You just earned yourself a trip to the pound! Who the hell do you think you are? Brian! Brian, do something. Look, I'm sorry about this. Let me just pay the fine or whatever and I'll make sure this doesn't happen again. - You can pick him up tomorrow. - Oh, okay. Just bring a trash bag. What did he mean by that? Any human that bites a dog gets euthanized. You know that. No. He doesn't. He's from another universe where dogs are subservient to humans. - Oh, you mean like that time we - Yeah. - When we bounced around between - Yeah. - And you couldn't figure out how to - Yes! They're gonna kill him! We got to get him out of there! It's a tough world here. You hear about it every night on the dog news. Coming up. That bush in the park is my bush! It's my bush! Look, there he is! Oh, thank God, I'm saved! Come on. Let's get out of here. All right. The two of you stand over there and I'll send you back where you belong. Gosh, Brian! I sure hope this next leap will be the leap home. Wait! Take me with you. What do you mean? You can't go back to our universe. Come on, a place where humans are in charge? I can't pass that up. Hey! Get away from there! - Well, this looks like home. - Is there any way we can be sure? Hmm. Mom, have you seen my Trapper Keeper? Yeah, we're home! Well, now what do we do about this guy? We got two Brians in our universe now. Don't worry. I don't plan to stay in Quahog. I'm gonna go out into the world and see what I can make of myself. I can be somebody here. And it should be easy for you because, I mean, what luck, you're white! You have no idea how big that is here. Goodbye, Stewie. Goodbye, Brian. Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Look at him go. Free in a world of his own kind where he can finally reach the full potential Oh, my God! He got hit by a car! English - US - SDH"

Wonder Woman. Aquaman. And Meg. Dedicated to truth, justice, and peace for all mankind. Hey, Quagmire. What you got there? It's the new Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. Check it out. Those swimsuit issues don't excite me like they used to. I've been spoiled by Internet porn. - It's true. - Totally. - What do you mean, ""Internet porn""? - You don't know about Internet porn? Don't know what? I'm not really a computer guy. Quagmire, I would think you, of all people, would know about Internet porn. They've got, like, thousands, literally millions of naked pictures on the Internet. - What? - And videos. Thousands of them. - You guys are messing with me. - Quagmire, you don't use the Internet? You mean that crappy dial-up thing that's a pain in the ass? No, I don't use the damn Internet. I thought that was for nerds. Why didn't you guys tell me? Oh, yeah. You can even see Tonya Harding's honeymoon video on there. I mean, it's gross, but it's, like, famous gross. You know, these women don't compare to the old swimsuit issues with Kathy Ireland. Yeah, she had it going on. You know, Horace still has one of those old beer promotion cutouts of her from, like, 1994, in the back room. Don't you, Horace? You mean this thing? I was about to throw it out. If anyone wants it, it's theirs.

And Darrell Armstrong faces a charge of battery against a female police officer. But Luke Walton's here and he's ready to play. Hey, Dad. Where are you going with that cutout? Oh, hey, kids. This is Kathy. We're designing lifestyle products together. It's completely legitimate, but don't tell your mother. I had a great time today at the museum. You were the most beautiful woman there. You know, Lois won't be home from groceries for a while. I have an idea. Knock, knock. Anyone in the bathroom? I love the time we've spent together, you know that? Hey, Kathy, guess what? I'm out. Under the table right now. I'm out. - Peter? - Oh, no. What the hell is going on? I sent you to pick up dinner an hour ago. What are you doing with that cutout? You know what, Lois? I'm glad you found out. I can't carry on the charade anymore. I have an announcement to make. No, no. I'll do it. I'll do it. I know I've been able to keep this a secret. But Kathy and I are not actually working on a project together. We're in love. - You're an idiot. - My lawyer will call your lawyer. Oh, this is the stupidest thing he's done since he got in a turf war with that cat. Hey, shut up! Now, kids, you don't have to call her Mom right away, but I do want you guys to get along. Just give her a chance. I think you'll like her. Maybe she'll let us do things that Lois won't let us do. Yeah. Hey, Mom, can I pull my pants down? If she doesn't answer, does that mean yes? That's what I've been going with. I want to get in on that. Mine's better. Mine's better. Mine's better! Oh, hello, Lois. I would have thought you'd have moved in with your mother by now. No, Peter. I'm just pretty much letting this run its course. Well, I'm sorry you're handling this so poorly, but have you seen Kathy? We were gonna go get her passport renewed. Oh, Chris took her into his room about 10 minutes ago. What? That whore! She's betrayed me worse than Lady Macbeth betrayed Duncan. I I don't know Shakespeare very well. Kathy! Kathy! There you are. Oh, don't give me that look. You don't think I know where you've been? How dare you make a fool of me? Did you have sex with that fat kid? Did you? Answer me! Oh, my God. Look what you made me do. Why did you have to provoke me? Why did you Quagmire? There you are. Nobody's seen you in days. Hey, Peter. I've just been checking out some of that Internet porn. - You okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I'm just gonna go and check my mail over there. - You been lifting weights? - No. No, I don't I don't think No. I'm I'm sorry, Peter. I I got to I got to get back. I'm sorry, Lois. I was a fool. I'm done with Kathy. Can you ever forgive me? Peter, settle down. Yes, I forgive you. Just as long as you're done with that stupid cutout. I just want you to know that every time I was with her, I was thinking of you. Peter, stop. Come on. I'm not in the mood. - Oh, Peter. - Oh, Lois, I missed you. You and your wonderful smile, and your beautiful eyes, and your awesome third boob that's on top of the other boob. What? Oh, my God. - Peter, that's not a boob. That's a lump. A lump? Holy crap! Peter, stop that! We're not having sex. I just told you I have a lump. I got a lump, too. And mine's easier to get rid of. Mrs. Griffin, I've got good news. Your test results came back negative. It appears the lump in your breast is not black gross boob death. - Breast cancer? - That's the layman's term, yes. - Oh, thank God. What a relief. - Yeah. That was scary. Now, Mrs. Griffin, although you're in the clear for the moment, we need to have a look at your family medical history to determine your future risk. That's curious. I didn't realize your mother was a Holocaust survivor. My mother? Oh, no. That's That's impossible. She's not Jewish. - According to her birth certificate, she is. - Oh, my God. Wow. Breast cancer's starting to look pretty good. - Mom, you're Jewish? - I'm sorry I never told you, dear. When we were married, your father made me conceal the fact so he could get into country clubs. - It was the right thing to do. - It was the right thing to do, dear. Oh, my God. So Grandma Hebrewberg is actually Jewish? Yes. When she moved to America, her family changed their name. It was originally Hebrewbergmoneygrabber. That makes you Jewish, Lois. And your children, too. This kind of rocks my world, even more than the time I went to that pediatrician. Whoa, Stewie. You're getting to be a big boy. I think somebody's gonna be a football star. - Oh, you. - Forgot your chart. Be right back. Whoa, Jason. You're getting to be a big boy. I think somebody's gonna be a football star. I can't believe I fell for that line. I actually let myself believe I could be a doctor's wife. You're just fat, Stewie. Silly and fat. Thank you for coming over, Max. I really need some advice from an actual Jewish person. Oh, it's my pleasure, Lois. I'm sure this all must be very overwhelming. I just don't know what to do with this information. I've spent my whole life as a Christian. I'll tell you what you should do with it. Absolutely nothing. That's the problem with this world. Too many people go overboard with what they believe. Like Quagmire when he thought he was the one getting the spinoff. See you later, bitches. Have fun with your stupid, goddamn giant chicken jokes and your Conway Twitty Hey, why is there a moving truck outside Cleveland's house? Well, I wouldn't put it quite like that, but, essentially, Brian's right. Being Jewish doesn't really have to change you or your family's life. Well, I guess you're right. There's no reason things should be any different around here. Shalom, Jews. Wow, Dad! Where did you get all that glistening chest hair? It came with my Star of David. Everyone, from now on our lives will be better. We'll be wealthy, our sons will become doctors, and we'll be in charge of charity, so we don't have to contribute to them. I'm offended by that, and I'm not even Jewish. Peter, what is all this? Look, this is my way of letting you know that I'm embracing who you are. Oh, and I don't respond to Peter. From now on, I want you to use my Hebrew name. Well, I caution you that becoming Jewish doesn't happen overnight. It's a process that involves spiritual education and good works. So what you're saying is that it happens overnight? Look, Peter, I'm the one with the Jewish heritage and I really don't want to make a big deal out of this. Leave it to a Jew to take all the fun out of being a Jew. Now, listen up. I like the hat and I like the scarf, so we're doing this. Kids, from now on this is where we'll celebrate the Sabbath. Peter, this is all unnecessary. Our life was fine the way it was. Check it out. I'm one of you guys now, huh? I'm Jewish! Yeah! Holocaust! We're number one! Look at all these short, hairy men. God, I feel like I'm on the forest moon of Endor. Good afternoon. As we approach the Passover holiday, let us remember the struggle of our people as they labored under the yoke of Pharaoh's despotic rule. Hey, if anyone appreciates a good yoke, it's the ""Yews. "" That's my Jewish laugh. I'm working on a Jewish laugh. Peter, I'm so embarrassed right now. Can we please just go? - Hi, you're pretty. - Oh, thank you. - Mom, is sodomy illegal if you're Jewish? - I hope so, Meg. I really do. It's not, Lois. It's not. - Dad, this isn't the way to school. - Yes, it is, Chris. One of the best parts about being Jewish is getting to take advantage of their excellent schools. I'm not going to no Jewish school. Sitting around all day with a bunch of short, hairy guys. I'll feel like I'm on the forest moon of Endor. Didn't you Didn't you make that joke the other day? Oh, yeah. No, I just I wasn't sure if everybody had had heard. And instead of lasting for one day, the oil in the lamp lasted for eight days. - And that is why we celebrate Hanukkah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. How long before we play ""Pin the eviction notice on the black guy's door""? - Now, does anyone have any questions? - Yeah, I have a question. What are you gonna do when Jesus comes back and puts a boot up your ass? And it's also why many families give their children eight days of presents. - Wait. Did she say eight days of presents? - Yeah. Well, this Judaism thing is gonna be better than I thought. All right, class. That's all for today's lesson. Now, everyone off to gym class. All right. Today we're gonna play soccer. Huh. That was easy. - Hey, Lois, the kids are all asleep. - I suppose they are. You know what else? I picked out a sexy little Jewish outfit for you at the store. - What is that? - Oh, my God, Lois. If you put on this long, thick dress right now, I will lose it! - Peter, I'm not wearing that thing. - And if you put this shawl over your head Do you have any clunky, unfashionable peasant shoes? Oh, I swear to God, Lois. I swear to God, I would lose it. Peter, get off me! Tell me I don't earn as much as your friend's husband. Peter, stop it. I'm going to sleep. Fine. I'll just sit here and watch TV. We now return to Mark Wahlberg in Annoyed and Confused. What? What's going on? I don't get it. Man, I got to work out. What's going on here? Where am I? What the Huh? What the hell's going on here? What? Peter! Dad? What do you think you're doing, Peter? You were raised Catholic. If you forsake your religion, you'll spend eternity in hell. Oh, God. I don't want that! Then you better knock off all the Jewish stuff. Well, all right. If that's what you think is best. Wait. Dad, before you go, can you say, ""Peter, you must go to the Dagobah System?"" Peter, you must go to the Dagobah System. Thanks. Anybody want toast or a bagel? Peter, what the hell? Lois, last night my father came to me and reminded me that I'm a good Catholic. If I don't rid the house of this Jewish curse, this family is gonna go to hell, and I won't let that happen. Peter, you were the only one who was even taking this thing seriously. Jews are gross, Lois. It's the only religion with the word ""ew"" in it. Oh, come on. You're acting crazier than when you were going through your Parker Lewis phase. Peter, you ready for dinner? That's just like the Parker Lewis episode when Parker Lewis ate dinner. Peter, nobody cares about your canceled show. Lois, Parker Lewis can't lose. Don't even try and make him lose 'cause it's just gonna be that much more embarrassing for you when you realize that he can't lose. Would he win in a fight with Batman? Well, Chris, think about what you're saying. Parker Lewis can't lose. Heretofore, Batman can suck on that. Suck on that? Suck on this. Tic Tacs have only one-and-a-half calories. - Well played. - I love you, Dad. I love you too, son. Huh? What the What the hell? How do you like it, huh? How do you like it? Peter, what in God's name is this? Wait a minute. Are these pieces of Stewie's crib? I hate it here. Oh, thanks for spending time with me today, Mom. I just had to get out of that house. Peter's being such a jackass. Lois, I think this is more serious than you realize. - Don't you see what he's doing? - He's just being immature. It's happened before. And it'll pass. Lois, what Peter is doing to you is exactly what Carter did to me for years. He's repressing your Jewish identity. But, Mom, I don't really care about being Jewish, or even Christian for that matter. I just want to be a good person on my own. All I'm saying is I let your father take my Jewish identity, and I've regretted it ever since. I don't want to see you make the same mistake. I don't know, Mom. I'll think about it. Carter, knock it off! Come on. You know you Jew girls want that dollar. Follow the dollar and it'll lead you to What do Jews like? Salmon! There's salmon over here. Is there really salmon over there? No. You walk over there and he squirts you with a squirt gun. What the hell? Are you out of your fucking mind? Relax, Lois. I was aiming for the mailbox. I'm just trying to make a point. Good morning, Lois. Peter, for God's sake! I am so sorry, Mort. No problem, Lois. That's just how people say hello to me. - Hey, Joe! Hey, Mort! Peter, you and I are gonna have a conversation. - I am very angry with you. - Geez, what's your problem? What you did this morning was so far out of line, I just Let me tell you this. Mom was right. I can't just sit here and let you dump all over my heritage. I'm not gonna make the mistake she did. I'm Jewish, and I'm proud of it. And this weekend, we're having a Passover seder. - You can't do that. It's Easter. - Not in this house. Lois, this family believes in the Easter Bunny. He died for our sins in that helicopter crash. Now, if you want to go to hell, that's fine. But don't drag the rest of us down with you like a mentally handicapped rooster. Good night, everybody! Okay, everyone. This is my first time doing a seder, which is where we tell the story of the Jews' escape from bondage in Egypt. Doesn't it seem like every Jewish holiday has to do with them escaping from stuff? No, Chris. And, you know, tricking some bigger, more athletic people? Lois, not that I'm rushing you, but when do we get to the wine drinking? Hang on. Hang on. Before we do anything, I'd like to say a blessing over the candles, if I may. Bear with me. I haven't had much rehearsal time. Can't we just eat? And now I shall continue the prayer. Now let's move on to the washing of the hands. This is a very important part of the Hey, hey, hey. The Easter Bunny is here. Happy Easter! Peter, what the hell are you doing in that? Have you been drinking? Not since I got out of the car. Who here thinks they can kick my ass? Peter, you are not gonna ruin this seder. Now, get out of here! I'm sorry, kids. I just wanted to help Brian run for mayor. I guess I forgot what was really important. - Peter, just go lie down. - All right. I'm gonna go lie down. And then I'm gonna come back and mess up your seder. All right, I'm back. And I'm much more sober. Lois, what you're doing is wrong. I want you to get all this Jew food off the table. - I most certainly will not. - It's me or your religion, Lois. I'm a Catholic, and I want to live in a Catholic house. Well, I'm a Jew, and I want to live in a nicer house. You really think I should run for mayor? Peter, you've got to stop living in your own stupid world. I'm sorry, but I can't be with someone who doesn't believe in Jesus. Hey, hey. Heard my name. Wow, Jesus! Oh, you're dead now, Lois. Jesus is gonna kill you. And then we're gonna bury you in the yard next to Kathy Ireland. I mean I mean, nice weather we're having. Look, Peter, I thought it might interest you to know that I'm Jewish. - What? - He's Jewish, Peter. Jewish? Like full on? Like you practice ""Jewiism""? - I am a Jew. - Prove it! - What's a 9% tip on a $200 bill? - $18. Which is fair. Oh, my God, it's true! But I'm so confused. Peter, it really doesn't matter. Catholicism and Judaism are not that different. They're two sides of the same coin. In fact, the Last Supper, one of the most iconic images of the Catholic faith, was a Passover seder. And if I'm not mistaken, Islam is also in that same spiritual family. Let's not muddy things up here. The most important thing is to treat other people the same way - you would want to be treated. - Oh! An eye for an eye. Well, Lois, I guess I owe you an apology. I was scared because my dad convinced me I was going to hell. And I was doing it to make up for my mother's mistake. Look, I don't know if being Jewish is the right thing for our family. I just wanted the chance to explore it so I could know for sure. But to tell you the truth, I thought we were fine before. But then, Jesus, which religion should our family be? - Six of one, they're all complete horseshit. Thank you! English - US - SDH"

Oh, that's right. - Don't you feel foolish. - Well, how long does it usually take you? - I don't remember. - Oh, my God! That is such a bunch of crap. I hope my son is having a better time with your family. Poachers! - Joe, I need to use your bathroom. - Sure, Peter. What the hell? How do you even What? It I don't Wait. How do I Yeah.

Let's get loud, let's get loud Turn the music up, let's do it Come on, people, let's get loud Let's get loud Turn the music up to hear that sound Let's get loud Peter, your breakfast is ready. Hang on, I'll be right back, Lois. I'm just going across the street. Peter, you can't keep using Cleveland's bathroom. Oh, my God. Yes, I can. Cleveland's bathroom is the greatest discovery since fat women discovered Diet Coke. Now I can eat anything! Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no. What are you doing? That's my bathroom! What are you talking about? We just rented this place. Holy crap! Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase! What the hell are you guys doing in Quahog? We're just doing research for a movie. Oh, my God, that's amazing. Listen, I got to tell you guys, I've watched all your movies, like, 1,000 times. - You saw Cops and Robbersons? - And My Stepmother is an Alien? Almost all of them. Boy, I sure would love it if you guys would come to our house for dinner tonight. My wife's cooking sucks, but I just want to look at you. - You like meatloaf? - Yeah. Sure. All right, see you at 8:00. Man, I can't believe I'm gonna have dinner with two of the Three Amigos! This is gonna be way better than when we had that Victorian girl ghost over for dinner. My governess drowned me in a well. You are a horrible dinner guest. Can you believe it? We're eating with two of the three Ghostbusters. Actually, I wasn't in that. Look at these guys! They can't take a compliment! You know, you guys are funny, but I got a confession to make. I'm a pretty funny guy myself. Maybe I say a few things here, maybe I get a few laughs, maybe you guys put me in one of your pictures. Well, yeah, I suppose it's possible. Yeah, we've got all kinds of roles available. Speaking roles, background roles. Background would be good for you. Yeah. Speaking role or background role, either one would be good. You know, I'm really good at sight gags. Oh! I didn't mean to do that. Now it's everywhere! That's comedy. Peter, what the hell is wrong with you? That's not funny. Oh, well, interesting opinion, Lois. Gee, I wonder if there's anyone else at this table who's maybe more qualified to say what's funny than you are. Well, we'd need to see a little bit more, but Is that the time? I can't believe that's the time. It's late. What? I don't understand. You're not wearing a watch. Well, you see, that's sort of a joke, Peter. - Oh. Well, that's not that funny. - It's kind of funny, you know. No, it's not funny. See, if you had said something like, ""It's half past a freckle. "" You know, I'm thinking, of the three of you, I'm I'm thinking this guy. Let me show you something that's funny. Okay, here's an impression of John Wayne on the first Thanksgiving. ""I'm John Wayne at the first Thanksgiving, pilgrims. ""Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims!"" Where's this guy been? Well, Mr. Griffin, this has been a lot of fun. - A lot of fun. - But we got to get back over to our place and kind of do What do we have to do? - Roll some joints and get high. - Yeah, we got to do those things. That's not funny. Drugs aren't funny. - They ruin lives. - Amen. - No, Peter. You're not funny. - I'm afraid Dan's right. - You're not funny at all. - I don't get it. You're painfully unfunny. Get the out of my house! Hey, Stewie, can I talk to you for a sec? Look, Brian, I've colored Sebastian the crab blue! If that isn't a middle finger to society, I don't know what is. I don't like it anymore. I wish I'd colored him red. Do you think it's a little odd that Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd have moved into Quahog together? I mean, why here? Why now? I don't know. Maybe we go over there and find out. Maybe we do. Hey. Hi, there. Can you guys tell Meg I'm seeing someone? You see anything? - Doesn't look like anybody's home. Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi? - What do we do? - ""Won't you gentlemen have a Pepsi?"" - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yell, yell, yell. Yell, yell, yell. What the What the hell is this place? Welcome to DUMP, Deep Underground Military Protection Facility. - Wouldn't that be DUMPF? - The ""F"" is silent, like in ""knife. "" We're actually working for the federal government, and we need your help. Do you want to be spies like us? Can we be spies like them? We've actually resolved our differences. Wait a minute. I don't understand. What do you mean you guys work for the government? Well, Brian, it turns out Spies Like Us was Ronald Reagan's favorite movie, so he actually appointed us honorary spies back in the '80s. That still doesn't explain what you're doing here. You see, Brian, during the Cold War, the Soviet Union brainwashed dozens of American civilians, effectively making them sleeper agents who could be activated at anytime to do the work of the KGB. Activated how? The agents could be activated by uttering a predetermined phrase. At which point, they would snap into a trance and mindlessly carry out whatever orders they were given by their KGB handlers. Well, I mean, what if they encountered somebody - who said the phrase accidentally? - Not possible. The activation phrase was something that no one would ever think to utter. - What is it? - The phrase is, ""Gosh, that Italian family at the next table sure is quiet. "" You see, the U.S. Government believes that one of these sleeper agents is right here in Quahog. Now, you two individuals live here. Are there any local residents whom you've seen acting strangely? Well, there's a pedophile up the street that nobody seems to be doing anything about, but it's mainly because he's so funny. Well, look, we'd be happy to help in any way we can. Hey, is Ron Howard's weird-looking brother one of these lab technicians? Of course he is. It's an '80s movie. Hey, there's something on the screen. And those two bums turned to me and said, ""You're not funny, Peter. "" - In my own house! - Well, what was the bit? Okay, ready? I'm John Wayne at the first Thanksgiving, pilgrims. Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims. - Oh, God. - Oh, my. Oh, my God, Peter! I'll tell you, and I'm your friend and I'll be honest with you, that's funny. That is funny. And you know what I appreciate about your joke, Peter? It's clean. It's clean funny! I just wish there was some way I could show them how wrong they are. Show them that we know comedy better than they do. Hey, I got an idea. What's the most consistently funny form of comedy in existence? - Improv? - Improv! - Improv! - Improv! - Improv! - Improv! We'll start our own improv group and put on a show. All right! Thank you for seeing us on such short notice, Mayor West. No problem, gentlemen. - May I call you ""gentlemen""? - Yeah. Now, you say this spy is located somewhere in Quahog? That's right. We need you to set up some roadblocks to help us contain him. Do you have any clues regarding the identity of the spy? It's a little tricky, sir. See, the operative is completely unaware that he's been programmed, and the only way to activate him and discover his identity is by saying the phrase, ""Gosh, that Italian family at the next table sure is quiet!"" It's him! I haven't been this Since I I don't I don't really know what I'm supposed to be doing, but Oh, there's track star Wilma Rudolph. Obviously, she had something to do with the gag, but I didn't hear the setup, so I don't really know the context Hey, I wonder what Peter's up to! Okay, so we got to come up with a name for our improv group. - Anybody got anything? Um - How about the Jokeridge Boys? - Not bad. - Wait. How about Funny Side Up? - No, no, no. Guys, guys, we got the name. It's Improv-de-Colon- the-Truth-is-Ad Libbed. - What about Deliveries in Rear? - Oh, yes! No, no! No, you can't just jam jokes in for no reason! It has to be organic to the situation! What the hell you being so frigging comedy Hitler about? I was in three improv groups in college, Peter. I was in Improvidence, I was in the Wackadamia Nuts, and I know I'm dating myself here, but Three Smile Island. My point being that I am the only experienced member of this group. I can already tell this is not gonna be fun. How do we know where to start looking? The tracking beacon I shot into Mayor West's ankle will allow us to locate him. Wow. Those are the Russian people? I mean, granted, you do think of bears on unicycles when you think of the Russian people, but they're all bears on unicycles? Bears on unicycles, every one. So what do we do now? We're undercover U.S. Agents in a hostile foreign territory. We just got to make sure we don't do anything that makes us stick out. Hey, they're not bears on unicycles! - You are under arrest. - Time to lose this costume. 'Cause we're in Russia! Here are the American spies we captured, Mr. Prime Minister. He was ""Putin"" us on, huh? Right? What do you think of that? Chevy? Right? That would have passed for funny in one of your movies, right? Okay, moving on. Gentlemen, let me put your minds at ease. I know why you are here, and I mean to help you. Well, terrific. The truth is the reactivation of a Cold War sleeper spy would be an embarrassment to my government. On the scale of our 1981 failed Czechoslovakian occupation outpost, which was penetrated by Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and their ragtag band of misfit soldiers who didn't even graduate! They slept through the graduation ceremony and somehow managed to come out of the manhole wearing clean, pressed suit, as you say. So the long and the veiny of it is, you're gonna help us out, right? I will provide you with transportation, passports, food, supplies, everything from ""A"" to backwards ""R."" Wow! Thank you so much for your help, Mr. Putin. Would you like to see Russian cutaway gag? - Yeah, sure. - Here is Russian cutaway gag. Where the hell is Quagmire? I don't know. He said improv rehearsal at 7:00, right? Yeah, where is Quagmire? I haven't seen him all day. You know what? I think he went down to the bank. What was that? What did you hit me for? I'm passing the story on to you. Keep it going. Keep the story going. - Huh? - What's Quagmire doing at the bank? It's improv, Peter. You don't think. You don't think. You just keep talking. You don't think. Don't think. Don't think. What comes to mind? Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk! I get it. Tap me, Quagmire, tap me! Quagmire went to the bank to donate sperm because it's a sperm bank. Yes, there you go. He's moving it forward. He's moving it forward. See, Peter? Now tap Peter. Hey, pilgrims. Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims. It's me, John Wayne. Oh, no. All right, you know what? You're not loosened up yet. All right, let's do some warm-up exercises. Okay, this is one we call ""Going Bananas. "" Okay. I'm a banana I'm a banana Peel the banana Peel the banana Now go bananas! Go, go bananas! Go! Come on, you guys. Do it with me. Go bananas. Yeah! Whole body, Joe. Whole body. Come on. Go bananas. Am I doing it? Am I doing it? the matter with you guys? All right, let's try something else. Okay, this is a warm-up exercise called ""One-Word Story. "" Now, I start a story with one word, and then you each continue with one word at a time. - Okay, ready? - Yeah, yeah. I'm into this now. - Okay. The - Dog - And - My - Mom - And - This - Handkerchief - And - Twenty - Birds - And - Peter. - Geez. - And - Peter, hang on a sec. - You're not contributing. - I'm doing it. You're not adding information. Well, one of you guys says ""Thanksgiving,"" - I got a good idea where to go with it. - Okay, Peter, let's try something different. Okay, close your eyes. What's the first thing you see? - Uh - Don't think, just say it. First thing. - Pelican. - Okay, what's he doing? He's complaining about some undercooked food. Who's he complaining to? A snooty French waiter who's really mean to his customers. But then when he goes home, his own life's sad because his girlfriend's mean to him, and his apartment isn't so very nice, and he's always running out of paper towels. I saw it I seen it, Quagmire. I was there in the apartment! We're ready. If these signatures are correct, Mayor West is located one-third of a kilometer that way. Just over this rise. Yeah, that's what you told us a third of a kilometer ago, you douche. Perhaps you'd like to do something besides criticizing me and quoting my movies? You just watch your mouth, mister! Look! Anyway, I'd be happy to help you conduct a search of Quahog and find What the hell? Where am I? I didn't just bite into a YORK peppermint patty, did I? Mayor West, you're in Russia. You've just launched a nuclear missile against the United States. Well, this day has taken a bad turn, like Mike Brady's first marriage. Here's your beer, honey. I don't remember asking for a warm beer. Well, I didn't want to quit working. You made me. You don't talk to me that way! - Alice, what did you see? - Enough to know I'm getting a raise. What the Oh, man. We're supposed to do a show tonight. Where's the audience? I don't see them anywhere. If only they could make some noise to let me know they're here. We're here. - Oh, there you are. Thank God. Well, we're Room for Improv-ment. So without further ado, I need a place. Your ass! - Okay, come on now. - Something serious. Your mom's ass! Hey, let's get that guy out of here, huh? Okay, a real place. Goldman's Pharmacy on Third and Maple. Give them the hours. - Okay, I heard ""pharmacy. "" - Who's in the pharmacy? John Wayne! What the Peter, you're not supposed to be in the audience. Get the hell up onstage. All right. Hey there, sir. Welcome to my pharmacy. Can I help you? Here's John Wayne at the first Thanksgiving. ""Happy Thanksgiving, pilgrims!"" You like that? Okay, here's John Wayne Bobbitt at the first Thanksgiving. ""Where's my penis, pilgrims?"" And here's John Wayne Gacy at the first Thanksgiving. ""I want to dress up like a clown ""and have sex with children and kill them, pilgrims. "" - Guys, I got to split. I took a wet duke. - And Okay, this is not something that should ever have been attempted. Thank you very much. Good night, everybody. Improv! I wish there was some way I could have prevented this. It wasn't your fault, Mayor West. There's nothing you could have done. To be honest, I don't remember a thing, except how much I love the Michael Jackson Thriller video. Boy, could that guy dance. Guy dance? Guidance! Source programmable guidance! We can reprogram and disarm the missile from here. From here? Well, our arms would have to be 40-feet long, Dan. No, yutz, not from right here. We go over there and do it. - Oh, right. - Oh, come on, Chevy. You should have known what he was talking about. All I have to do is bypass the primary navigational-guidance circuits, deprogram the hardwired safety overrides, and reconfigure the motherboard so that the missile's primary central-processing unit tells itself to eject its own warhead while still safely above the Earth's atmosphere. Hey, Dan, when this is all over, you may get a call asking you to evaluate my performance. Can I count on you to give me a 10? And that should do it. You did it, Dan. My God, you did it! Yes. Oh, my God. You did it. You did it. Mission accomplished, gentlemen. Warhead has been destroyed. We've saved millions of lives. Let's just hope the fuselage doesn't fall where it can cause too much damage. No, no, no, no, no, no! I I don't get it. So, what's the deal with Chris? Is he actually, like, still in Africa? No, no, he's not. - So that was all That was just a bit? - Yeah, he'll be back next week. Great. Boy, who would have thought all this trouble could be caused by simply uttering the phrase, ""Gosh, that Italian family at the next table sure is quiet. "" Shut up, 2476. English - US - SDH"

                    			It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do All the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy One minute to opening, everybody. Why are they selling all those DVDs so cheap? Because, Chris, DVDs are outdated and obsolete, like white track stars. On your marks. Get set. White guys, go! I have high hopes for this. I had a Clif Bar before we started. Everybody else! I thought they were coming after us. All right, everyone. All DVDs are a dollar and everything must go. Come on in. Please be here. Please be here. Oh, sweet mother of God! There you are! I'll watch you with the lights off. Like I would dare. - You're getting Dan in Real Life? - What? I heard it's good. No, I get it. He's resting his head on pancakes. It looks hilarious. The joke, of course, being that one wouldn't generally do that, were there a pillow available. Oh, my God! Road House! - I want to buy this! - Great. And as a bonus, I'll throw in What Dreams May Come with Robin Williams. - No, thank you. - No charge. - I do not want it. - But it's free, sir. If that DVD even touches Road House, I will kill you. Don't worry. Someday, someone will come and take you home for their very own. Maybe far away Or maybe real nearby He may be pouring her coffee She may be straightening his tie Help! Somebody! These drunk redneck truckers are trying to have their way with me! Not while my scrotum is pressed up against my stomach in these jeans, they won't. Road House. That was awesome, and its message is timeless. Peter, the only message in that movie is that every problem in life can be solved by kicking. Oh, my God! Brian, you're right. Peter, I'm joking. - What did you say to me? - Peter, what are you doing? - Get off my plane! - That's not even the same What the hell? You're not gonna talk to me like that in my bar! It's not a bar Oh, that's right. Cleveland moved. - Here's your burger, sir. - Thank you. Sir, I need another $1.25. Is that right? Keep the change. Road House. Okay, that is the last time you are gonna pull that crap! - You hear me? - Yes! Do you hear me? Yes! And you are gonna hold down that football until Charlie Brown kicks it. You got that? - Yes. - Go ahead, Charlie. And you know what else? I did some checking around. You're not a licensed therapist. Road House. You know, it's still early, Peter. What do you say we horse around a little, huh? I think I can get on board with that. Road House. Peter, for God's sakes! If you're gonna do that, at least aim for my nipples. Oh, yeah! Road House. Peter, I don't think you should be driving with your feet. Road House. Wait. Why are you taking the back way home? There are so many turns. Road House. Road House. Road House. Road House. Road House. - Road House. - Oh, my God! - Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm fine. Sorry. I wasn't really looking where I was going. - Probably a little blame on our side, too. Road House? Well, I guess we're just lucky nobody got hurt. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. But, you know, I sort of have one other problem. - Maybe you can help me out. - What's that? I have a dinner reservation for two tonight at Dominic's, and it's just me. I see your problem. I think I might be able to help. Ma'am, you want me to kick those dents out for you? Peter, we've had complaints from all over town. You're gonna have to stop with the kicking. Oh, yeah? I think my scary, otherworldly, shadowy spirit friends might have something to say about that. Ghost. - Can I help you? - Hi, I'm Brian. I'm here to pick up Nicole. Oh, hi. I'm Rita, her mom. You must be the one she had that fender bender with. Well, I got to meet Nicole, so I prefer to think of it as a happy accident. - Is she ready? - Oh, well Unfortunately, she left for dinner with another guy about half an hour ago. What? We had a date. Yeah. I'm afraid that's Nicole. She's 21 and gorgeous. Guys ask her out all the time and I think she loses track. Oh, for God's sake! Well, let me at least leave my car-insurance information for her. - Is that your condom? - No! I mean I mean, I wasn't gonna use that on your daughter. I mean, I wouldn't I would not use a condom on your daughter. I mean, I would if I was having sex with her, which obviously I would not do. But if I mean I'm safe and all, you know? I get an AIDS test once every three months. And not because I You know, it's not because I have a lot of sex. I just I just eat a lot of poo off the street. Come to think of it, how did this get in my wallet in the first place? '""Dear Brian, '""somewhere between the point when you're excited enough to want it '""and too excited to care, think about your future. '""Your friend, Stewie. '"" Well, I think I've been humiliated enough for one evening. - Sorry to bother you. - Lf it's any consolation, I would never have stood you up. Well, I guess that makes you one of the rare ones nowadays. - Your husband's a lucky guy. - Divorced. Oh. Well, at the risk of humiliating myself once again, - I still have a reservation. - Well, I don't have plans. Well, terrific. Hey, maybe I'll get to use this after all, huh? I'm just I'm kidding. Oh, please. At my age, I don't have to worry about pregnancy. - How old are you? - Oh, you don't want to know. - I kind of do. - Hang on. Just let me get my purse and we can go. Wow, she seems great! We're getting along better than Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown. - You want to smoke some crack? - You want to smoke some crack? - I love you. - I love you. Get the fucking crack! Brian, you want some lasagna? No, thanks. Rita and I grabbed a bite already. Gosh, you've been seeing this Rita for weeks now and you still haven't brought her over to the house. When are we gonna meet the lovely lady, huh? Oh, she's being ironic. What are you saying? I don't date lovely women? Yeah, you got it. You got it. No. It just seems like some of your past girlfriends have been a little dumb and trampy. First of all, that's not true, and second of all, she's not like that. She's wonderful. She's smart. She's pretty. And, you know, the only reason I haven't brought her around is that you guys don't always make the best impression with girls I date. Especially Peter. Hey, aren't you that chick from the bathroom door? Come on, Peter. She doesn't want to talk about work. What's it like in there? I assume it's like how it is in the men's room. Oh, there's a long trough with a big poo in it? You know, Brian, the past few weeks have been great. I can't remember the last time I've had this much fun dating somebody. I can remember the last time I have. Never. That's the writer in you, Brian. Did you always know that's what you wanted to do? Well, actually, I really thought I was gonna be an actor at one point. I even got a few high-profile gigs. Really? Anything I've seen? Oh, you ever heard of a tiny little independent movie called Die Hard? Wow! You were in that? Sure was. Hey, what do you say we go back to my place and I'll show it to you? Sounds good to me. We'll have to be a little quiet. Everyone's asleep. Have a seat. Okay, watch this. This is my scene. Doesn't make sense, man. Hey, don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey who was on my way home when you rang. The way you drove that car, I figured you for the street, Al. In my youth. In my youth - Okay, here it comes. Watch. Watch. We've had situations where the hostages have embraced their captors after their release and even corresponded with them in prison. No, no. No, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn. D-A-W-N. - Sir? - Yeah? Sir, the FBI is here. - Oh, the FBI is here now? - Yes, sir. Right over there. - Hold this. - Want a breath mint? Breath mint. I ad-libbed that line. Well, I had no idea I was dating a famous actor. - Should we go upstairs? - Sounds good to me. That's right, Shia. Give me all you've got. Okay, the coast is clear. Oh. Good morning. - Oh. Hey, Lois. - Who's Who's your friend? - Rita, this is Lois. Lois, Rita. - So great to meet you. - Lovely to meet you. - Perfect. Everyone hits it off. Listen, Rita, why don't you wait in the car? - I'll be out in a minute. - Okay, sweetie. Well, you met her. What do you think? - What? - What do I think? She's 100! Oh, my God! Peter, did you see her? I'm looking at her now! I can see her from the window up here. Hey, anybody make a Jessica Tandy joke yet? - No! Awesome. I'll be right down. Hey, Brian, who are you dating? Jessica Tandy? Son of a bitch! Damn it, Chris, I called that from upstairs! What are you guys talking about? She's a beautiful woman. You know, Lois, you, of all people, should be pleased. I mean, all the crap I take for dating young bimbos. How old is she, Brian? What difference does it make? Age has nothing to do with anything. Okay, you know what? I'll bring her to dinner and you can see for yourself what a bright, fun and charming woman she is. Wonderful. I'll cook something that's not too binding. She's not that old. Old is Malcolm in the Middle in Season 15. Malcolm, Dad drove the car over your science project. Oh, brother. How am I gonna survive junior high school with this screwed-up family? And me, in the middle of it all. A bunch of brothers living together? What a way to run a railroad. Well, Rita, I'm so glad you could join us for dinner. Thanks for having me, Lois. This food is delicious. Oh, thank you. I'm so glad you can taste it. Hey, you know what we haven't done for a while? Go around the table and everybody says what year they were born. So, kids, how was your day? - Well, the sandbox was - It was great! Guess he's going first. We got a new pencil sharpener in math class! Well, that's nice. Say, Rita, who was President when you were born? - Great pot roast, Lois. - Thank you, Brian. Rita, would you like me to cut yours up a little smaller? Oh, I'm fine. Boy! Speaking of that, I don't know how many people have asked me today where I was when Martin Luther King was shot. I'm sure you've been asked. What do you tell them? Who can forget? I remember just crying like a baby. Crying like a baby? Or crying like someone in college? Say, Brian, on her answering machine, how long after her message is the beep? Wow. This has just been a delight. You can't go yet. We haven't had dessert. Interesting. You know, the first time I had dessert was 36 years ago today. How about you, Rita? You remember your first dessert? Lord, no! It was so many years ago. Like 40 years ago? - Peter - What were stagecoaches like? Fifty years ago? Would that be a good guess? - Oh, dear. - Peter! - How old are you? How old are you? - Fifty! Okay? I'm 50! Happy now? You people are awful! You know, this is what's wrong with society! Nobody bats an eye if a woman dates an older man, but God forbid it's the other way around! There is nothing wrong with me dating Rita. She's beautiful, she's a charming woman, and I love her! - Rita. - Oh, Brian, please leave me alone. They're right. I'm just an old fool thinking we could be together. Will you stop that? They're insane. They don't know what they're talking about. - You're an amazing woman. - You're just saying that. No, I'm not. The only thing that matters is how I feel about you. - Rita, I love you. - I love you, too, Brian. I think you're the most wonderful woman I've ever met. - Will you marry me? - What did you just say? Come on. You're only 50. You heard me. Will you marry me? Oh, Brian. Yes! Yes, Brian, I'll marry you! Hey, Mom. Hey, Brian. We'll be upstairs. - Yo, Rita. You want in on this? - No, thanks. We just got engaged. - I'm faithful to Brian now. - Whatever. This ain't even my whole night. - You're engaged? - Yes. Rita and I are getting married. My God! I can't even react big enough. Here's Mrs. Garrett. What? Look, if my happiness means so little to you all that you have Charlotte Rae just standing by to crack a joke, then you really disappoint me. Look, Brian, I apologize for the other night. We were all very insensitive. And if this is what you want, we as a family support your decision. I don't. I'd rather you marry a - A Japanese or something. - I'm with you, too, buddy. In 20 years, she'll be 70, and you'll have been dead for 15 years. God bless the both of you. Hey, it's 4:30. Isn't there an early-bird special you should be running off to? She's 50, Stewie! She's not an old woman. Hello? Hey, Rita. No, I'm not hungry yet. Well, if we get there by 5:30, I'm sure they'll honor it. Brian, is she calling dinner ""supper""? So, what are you doing this afternoon? ""Oh, I'm just sorting out my pills for the week, sweetie. "" Well, you do that and I'll be over a little later. Did I get it? Was she sorting out her pills for the week in that little plastic thing with the seven boxes? Actually, she just got back from the gym and she's jumping in the shower. - She got a chair in that shower? - Shut up! Have archaeologists ever discovered ancient Egyptian pottery in her vagina? You know what? That one was too wordy. That one was too wordy. That was flawed from the ground up. It wasn't funny, and we'll work on it and get back to you. Hey, Rita? - Yeah? Where do you keep your toothpaste? - What are you looking for? Tooth polish? - Toothpaste, yeah. - Just use the baking soda. - Baking soda? What the hell, I can skip a night. Oh, I've never noticed this picture before. Is that you when you were a little girl? Oh, yeah. That's the summer my family went to DC. That flag's missing some stars, there. Why don't you come to bed, Brian? What do you say we make a little whoopee? Yeah, sure. Why not? You okay? I'm not hurting you, am I? No, I'm fine. What are you talking about? I just want to make sure you're comfortable. - I love you, Brian. Sock it to me! - What? - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing. When I'm on my back, sometimes my breast can slide in my armpit. - Just got pinched, that's all. - Okay. - Was that your boob? - God, no! I think I broke my hip. Oh, my God, what should I do? Call the number on my bracelet. It says ""Murray Hill 4185."" That's not enough numbers! That's the number, Brian. Just dial 0 and read it to Sarah. Jesus Christ! She's fine. She's out of surgery and she's resting. Well, how did she break it? Did she fall? Yes, she fell. You know, Brian, a woman her age comes in here, they don't always leave. Peter, she's gonna be okay. Listen, Brian, you say the word and I'll go in there with a pillow and you won't have any more problems. How many times do I have to tell you I'm sticking by this woman? - I love her! - Careful, Brian. Sometimes the things you love can disappoint you. Like that Playboy issue. Here we go. '""Playboy's Women of the Olympics. "" Wow, those are some broad shoulders. Okay, I guess small boobs are good for swimming. Not sure I like chiseled quads so close to a vagina. Those are balls. Brian? Brian! Oh. Is the soup ready? - Yeah. Got it right here. - Oh, good. I need to take my pills. It's been three hours. You know, they warned me these blue ones were gonna make me constipated. - Right they were. - Okay. - I am plugged up. - No, I got it. Do it, Brian. Do it. It's me as a pillow. You know what, Brian? I could really use some milk of magnesia. Okay. Well, I'll go pick some up. Thanks, Brian. I love you. And if you're going out, get some milk of magnesia. Yeah. You just said that. I am plugged up. - Wow, you are really pretty! - Thanks. - You know, I wrote a book. - What's that? - It's like a long magazine. - Huh? It's like the Internet made out of a tree. Oh. Weird. You want to have sex in the bathroom? Oh, gosh! What a treat! Yes. Yes. I would like that. Boy, that took you a long time! Did you have to wait for the streetcar? Look, Rita. I have a confession to make. I met a girl, I had a couple of drinks - and I slept with her. - You what? I know. I feel awful. It was a terrible thing to do. I'm so sorry. It'll never happen again. But there's an upside. You see, these past few weeks I've been doubting whether we're compatible. You know, because of the age difference. But I realized that that doesn't matter. What I get from you is what I always wanted, a smart, sexy, real person who I can talk with and share every piece of me with. I had a moment of weakness today, but, in a way, it's all right because it's taken me to a place where I now realize that you're not too old for me. Isn't that great? You're not too old for me! You know what, Brian? You're not old enough for me. - What? - You cheated on me. That's what happened today. You can rationalize it any way you want, but to me, all that shows is that you're an immature guy who doesn't realize what a catch I am. I'm sorry, Brian, but you screwed up. Now please go. - But, Rita - Go! You can leave my apartment key on the davenport. - Here? - No, the davenport, the chesterfield. - On this? - No. Does that look like a divan to you? - Here? - Leave them on the chifforobe. You know what? Just take your fucking keys. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. English - US - SDH"

Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do All the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy Hi, Chris. How'd you do on your science test? I got a D. A D? That's fantastic! Just kidding. I know it means you suck. Come here, you delightful idiot! - Another D, Chris? - I'm sorry, Mom. But science is so hard. Well, maybe you just need a little extra help. Dad, would you help me with my homework? Chris, I gotta tell you, that sounds worse than a trip to a failing mall. All right, kids. Your mom is gonna go to the Cinnabon that has the cage pulled halfway down. And I'm gonna go to the stereo store next to the dead fountain with garbage in it. Let's say we meet back here under the glue outline of the old Limited sign. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. Every time I try to study, the evil monkey comes out of my closet and scares me. Oh, for God's sake, Chris! You're in high school now. Stop talking about that evil monkey! He's not real. He is too real! I can prove it! Well, you'll have to do a better job than you did on your science test. Or than God did when he left the iron on Ellen Barkin's face too long. - Oh, damn! - How is it? You know what? We'll put you in the '80s. You'll pass for hot. Now, get in the van with Kelly McGillis. Next stop, Hollywood! Up next, the Hannah Montana marathon. Yes! And for all you fans, the Miley Cyrus tour is coming to the Quahog Civic Center for three nights only. Call to get your tickets now. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! But not now. 'Cause it just sold out. What? Oh, no. No! No, no! No! I'm calling anyway! I need Hannah Montana tickets and I need them now! Never mind who this is! Can you get them or not? I guess I should dial something first. What's all the noise? What are you watching? Sorry. But you know the rules. Hannah can't do the photo shoot until Miley finishes her homework. You can't tell Hannah what to do. She's not your daughter. Wait. So, Miley's my daughter, but Hannah isn't? - Right. - Great. Put your wig on. Shut up! This is real. - You're watching Hannah Montana? - Well, yeah. To make fun of it. I mean, look how stupid she is with her clothes and her makeup, and that fabulous hair and Oh, my God, Brian! It's my favorite show! It's my favorite show ever! - Jesus. - And she's coming to town! And I have to get tickets, Brian! You have to help me get tickets! No. It's a stupid show and a huge waste of time. But she's my favorite. Oh, my God. Are you crying? Yes! Hannah Montana is my hero! I love her so, so much! And this is the only time she's gonna be in town! And now I'll never get to see her! Will you help me? No. Hey, Chris. You want to practice kissing again? I'm busy. I set up a video camera last night, so I can prove to Mom and Dad that the evil monkey is real. And I want to see what I got. Oh. Nothing. All right, it's time to play rough! - You wanted to see me? - Yes, yes, come in. Close the door. Take a look at this, Brian. - Recognize him, Brian? - No. It's your brother. I found him for you, buddy. What? Jerry? That's amazing. Can he hear me? Hi, Jerry. - What's that big thing around his neck? - Oh, I'll show you. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What did you do? I killed him, Brian. And he's the lucky one. He went quickly. There were nine dogs in that litter. Now, are you going to help me get those Hannah Montana tickets? Stewie, you're not going to be able to get tickets. It's, like, the biggest thing in town. It's sold out. Then you are going to help me find a way to get in. - Okay, okay, I'll help you. - Excellent. Wait, you managed to hunt down eight dogs that were born years ago on a farm in Texas, and you can't manage to get Hannah Montana tickets? That's what I said. I got you, you bastard! Well, here he is! The evil monkey! Do you believe me now? - Holy crap! - It is real! - Oh, my God! I thought I was the only one! - Meg, we're doing Chris' monkey. - Oh, my God! Chris was right! - Holy crap! Chris, is that thing dangerous? - Yes! He's evil! - I'm not really evil. It talks! If someone will please untie me, I'll explain everything. No, Dad! Don't do it! He's evil! Look, just trust me. This is all a huge misunderstanding. Chris, I think we should give him a chance to explain himself. No! Thank you very much. Now, I know this looks bad, me living in your son's closet and all. But it's a very complex situation. You see, basically, I got home from work one day and found my wife cheating on me with another monkey. Oh, that's terrible. I fell into a deep depression after the divorce, which ended up costing me my job. All my money was gone, which means I lost the house. So I moved into Chris' closet just until I got back on my feet again. Wound up living in there for nine years. Oh, my God! You've missed so much. Like when America was attacked by mentally-challenged suicide bombers. You know something? You're not evil at all, are you? No, he's not. He's just a poor fellow who's down on his luck. Easy for you to say! He doesn't hide in your closet making a scary face! That's just the face I make when I'm thinking. - And you're always pointing at me. - I was trying to start a conversation. And you do that weird trembling thing! I have a copper deficiency. Look, Chris, I'm sorry if I scared you before. But this is a great chance for us to start over. No, it isn't! You can fool everyone else, but you can't fool me! You go to hell! - Hi, we're on the list. - Names? Stewie Griffin and Kanye West. - Yo, yo, yo. - You don't look like Kanye West. - That's what I said. - No, I'm him. Then sing one of your songs. Freddie Sanford Freddie Sanford and his son Freddie Sanford In a junkyard having fun What the devil will they screw up next? You are Kanye West! Okay. Now, remember to play it cool. Act like you belong here. Oh, my God, Miley! I love you! I love you! I love you! I'm your biggest fan! Can I touch your hair? Who are you guys? How did you get back here? Look, I'm really sorry about this. This is my friend Stewie. He's just a baby. And he's your biggest fan. And he has cancer. Oh, my God! Really? Yeah. He's got a tumor in his head the size of a football. I think I can see it. Well, in that case, I wouldn't feel right about throwing you out. Especially if you're my biggest fan. Stay here. You can watch the show from backstage. And afterwards, we'll all hang out. Sweet niblets! This is the greatest day of my life. - Sweet niblets? - Yeah, sweet niblets. That's her catchphrase, sweet niblets. - Say it. Say it back to me. - What? - Say, ""sweet niblets""! - Sweet niblets. That wasn't so hard, was it? I mean, Sarah Silverman is just one of the most wonderful people you'll ever meet. That's so good to hear. I want to like her. She's so funny. I want her to also be nice. - Could you tell us some stories about her? - Of course I can. Right after I show you how to make homemade root-beer popsicles. You, sir, are good company. Well, I'm glad you guys are having such a great time with that evil thing that tortured me for years! Dad, I thought you were gonna help me with my book report. Chris, there is a monkey here. And I just fed him a whole bag of Subway sandwiches. In a couple hours, we are gonna sit around and throw his soft-bread stool at each other. Now, you are welcome to be a part of that, or not. - I'm just telling you what's gonna happen. - Well, thanks for nothing, Dad! Don't mind him, Monkey. He's just a big disappointment. Like things that look like DVDs from far away. DVDs! Oh, books. That feels so good. You are an artist. Thank you. Lois doesn't like my toenails 'cause they stab her in the night. Hear that, Lois? Somebody likes my toenails. - Good for you, Peter. - Good for this family. Good for all of us. Mom! Dad! I got an A on my book report! - That's wonderful, honey. - Congratulations, Chris. What did you write about? Um ""The Slave Trade Allegory of Curious George. "" - Wait a minute. I didn't write this. - Oh, really? - Did Did you write this? - Well, I can't take all the credit. I've been listening to you talk in your sleep for years. So, I just put your thoughts on paper. That's all. Wow. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. Thanks, evil Thanks, Monkey. I'd get up to hug you, but sitting down's the only thing keeping the shit in. Nah, that's okay. I can't believe I'm sitting here with you, Miley Cyrus. It's like I'm in a dream. Well, that makes me happy, Stewie. - What are you doing? - Oh, I'm just writing some new lyrics. - You write your own lyrics? - Yeah. So do I. Oh, you wrote a song? Look at you. You're a regular little Tim McGraw. I'm a little better than Tim McGraw. - Hey, these are pretty good, Stewie. - Really? Do you think you could sing them? Only if you sing with me. You and I didn't quite get along when we first met When you put us together we just didn't blend But the more that I know you the more it's a good fit Now we've got what it takes to be very best friends A friendship is the best thing ever Except for best friendship which is a little better You mean a lot better I mean a lot better Now we're friends Yes, it's true But no one else can friend me like you A friendship is the best thing ever Except for best friendship which is a little better You mean a lot better I mean a lot better With you - Hey, where you guys been? - We went to the father-son barbecue. You drove all the way up to Fatherson for a barbecue? No, Dad. It was a barbecue for fathers and sons. Wait a minute. You went with the monkey to a father-son thing? Well, it's not like you ever take me anywhere. - What? - Oh, listen, Peter. I didn't - Meg, please! - It's true. You never want to do anything with me! But the monkey's been taking me to all the fun places I like! And he's been helping me with all my homework! He helped me get an A in algebra! How did the monkey know you needed help with algebra? Because he asked! That's right, Dad. You never ask. And even if you did, you never listen! And now you're getting mad at the monkey because he actually cares? Screw you! You are the worst dad in the world, and I hate you! Well Well, I hate you, too! Oh, damn. I left my cell phone up at that monkey-kid barbecue. I thought you said it was a father-son barbecue. - Yeah. But it was up in Monkeykid. - What? Boy, you guys have been awful quiet this morning. Lois, could you ask Chris to pass the maple syrup? Meg, could you tell Dad that he's too fat to need extra syrup? Lois, could you tell Chris that I'm sorry I ever planted the seed version of him in your vagina? I want you two to stop this. This is no way for a father and son to act. Well, according to him, that stupid monkey's more of a father to him than I am. He makes time for me, and you never do! You're supposed to love me and all you do is hurt me! This morning, I had a hard poo that hurt, but then it felt great. Meg, I'm trying to be mad right now, but that's making me want to smile. This'll get Chris. Hey, classmates. - Griffin, did you gain weight? - That's not important. But you know what is important? I'm gay now. Let's all of us go be gay somewhere together. And then you go tell all your friends that I welcome them to be gay with me, too, because I am gay. - I'll be gay with you. - Oh, this is too perfect. Chris is gonna be so gay by the end of this. What's this? Well, that's a no-brainer. Come on, you fat fuck. Do it. Who's laughing now? I got my hat. Hey, guys. I stopped at Pinkberry and I got some for everybody. - Wow, thanks! - You're welcome. I gotta go put on my face for press interviews. - Stewie, can you hand me my cell phone? - Oh, sure. Thanks. That was weird. Did you hear that when I was giving her the phone? - No. - It was like interference or something. Wait a second! Oh, my God! She's an android! Miley Cyrus is an android! Of course. She's a product of Disney Imagineering. - They built a perfect robot teen idol. - Yes, assuring that she could never fail. Like famous duelist, Sir Henry ""Giant Hole in the Torso"" Wickenshire. Ah-ha! Right through me! Prepare for returned fire, Sir Joseph Broadfront. I give you one last chance to rescind your insult of calling me a common dandy. Never! My God! I can't believe she's an android. Do you think we should tell someone, or do something? Well, we could do something. - Like what? - Well, look at her. She dances like a real girl. She moves like a real girl. Yeah? Do you think she does other stuff like a real girl? You know, if you reprogrammed her? - Brian, that's sick. She's 16! - I'm eight. - I don't know. - You killed my brother. You owe me. All right. I'll see what I can do. - Hey, Miley. - Oh, hi, Stewie. Hey, your shirt tag is showing. Let me just There we go. All done. Miley smash! Uh-oh. Hang on. Hang on. Maybe I can fix this. - Did you do it? Did it work? - You know, give it a shot, Brian. But I have to warn you, I think her vagina is also a DVD burner. Run! We now return to Great Moments in Women's Stand-Up Comedy. Sorry to interrupt nothing, but, Monkey, do you think you could help me? I just can't stand Peter and Chris being at each other's throats anymore. Of course, Lois. I'm sure if we can just get them in the same room together, I can convince them to talk it out. Why don't you invite Peter to lunch, and I'll invite Chris, - and we'll see what we can do. - Thank you. I really appreciate it. What the hell are you doing here? I thought I was meeting Lois. She wanted me to talk to you guys about the way you've been behaving. Look, Monkey, Chris is being a jerk, all right? And there is nothing you can say that will make me change my mind about that. Peter, you're acting bananas. - All right, I'll listen. - You're both good guys. And that's why it's important for you to reconcile your differences. I wasn't able to do that, and that's why I wound up living in a closet for nine years. Chris, I know you're angry, but do you really hate your father? - No. I just think he's a douche. - Sometimes he is. And, Peter, do you really hate your son? No. But sometimes he's such a little fat jerk! Well, it's only because you never have any time for me! Peter, do you think you could make a little more time for your son? Yeah, I guess so. - What the hell was that about? - Was that Stewie and Brian? It's Miley Cyrus, and she's destroying the city! Oh, my God! Miss Cyrus, I ask you to stop what you're doing. I don't just mean this. I mean everything. The show, the music, it's all just awful. Dad, we gotta help him! Do something! - What am I supposed to do? - You're my dad! Think of something! Quagmire, fire up the biplane. My son needs my help. All right, Peter. We're closing in. Get ready to fire. Giggity Giggity Giggity Giggity Giggity Giggity Giggity Giggity Giggity! Monkey, grab my hand! - Well, the airplane got her. - Oh, no. It wasn't the airplane. 'Twas Beauty killed the Beast. You know, Brian, here's your shot. Go for it. - Too late. - No, it's not. Thanks for everything, Monkey. You made me realize how much Chris really means to me. And how I should always remember not to take him for granted. Well, sometimes all anybody needs is a little bit of a wake-up call. And now that you two are getting along again, my work here is done. - Guess I'll be moving on now. - You have to leave? But I thought you were gonna go back to living in my closet again. I think that time of my life is over, Chris. But I'll always remember you. - But where will you go? - I'll go where I'm needed. Dad! There's an evil monkey in my closet! I don't care, Son. I just do not care. English - US - SDH"

                    			It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those good old-fashioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who positively can do All the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy - How's the garage sale going, Quagmire? - Pretty good. Just clearing some of my stuff out of the basement. It's amazing what you find when you clean your basement. Peter, you almost done down there? - Look what I found. - That's wonderful, Peter. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go do some skywriting. Hey, look at all these videos Mr. Quagmire's selling. Wow! The Best of the World's Wildest Police Chases. And it even has the one with the Flintstones. Amazingly, this drunk driver turns left into oncoming traffic. He narrowly misses hitting a pedestrian, who jumps out of the way just in time. Now the driver can add attempted battery to the charges. The driver turns right into the parking lot of a drive-in movie theater. At this point, the dinosaur in the backseat pokes his head up through the roof and the driver places two small children on top of it. Now he's not only endangering his own life, but their lives as well. The driver totals the car and makes a run for it, but the pursuing officers are prepared. Running from the cops? Yabba-dabba-don't! Hey, Quagmire, I think I might want to buy this ham radio off you. Sure, Peter. That'll be $50. Fifty bucks? All right, fine. I'll buy it. Man, this is a bigger rip-off than Shrunky Dinks! - They already been shrunk. - Happy Birthmas. Peter, you've been fiddling with that ham radio for seven weeks. Take a shower. I can barely get any reception on this stupid thing. So far, the only station that comes in is some British guys reading news from places I'm not sure exist. Today, in Kuzikistan, a peaceful demonstration turned to bloodshed as members of the Turzili tribe flooded Kenpao Square in remembrance of the third anniversary of the Holmsburg Massacre. But finally, some good news out of neighboring Kanduzi, as locals there have reached an uneasy alliance with the bordering Trolika Bubsie Wubsie Dal. And now with sports, here's Framptal Tromwibbler. From the world of sport, the Contein Spinky Whompers flumped the Floing Boing Welfenclumpers, 70 fluff to 40 flabe. At the tone, the time will be 26 railroad. I'm not sure about any of that. You know, Dad, I saw that movie White Noise, and they said you can use empty radio static to talk to dead people. You idiot. Ghosts don't exist. Wait a second, they might. Hello, ghosts. Come in, ghosts. I am Peter Griffin. I am your friend. Don't be shy. Humphrey Bogart. Don Knotts. That kid I was supposed to be watching at the pool. - Hello? Hello. - Hello? Who's this? - This is Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan? The guy that used to bang that 70-pound witch? Ronald Reagan, former president of the United States. Oh, my God! Hey, Quagmire, guess who I'm talking to right now? Yup. Brian, will you take me down to babyGap? I want to dress like a small douche. - No. Maybe tomorrow or Tuesday. - But you said you'd do it today. I'm kind of tired. For God's sake. Cancel my Tuesday appointments. Sure thing, Stewie. You want me to move it to another day? - No, no. Just cancel it. - Okay, will do. - Who the hell was that? - Hmm? There was another Stewie right there. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, I've been so damn busy lately, my schedule's been so packed, I felt like I needed some kind of an errand boy to do all my nitpicky, pain-in-the-ass stuff, so I cloned myself. You You cloned yourself? - What, are you deaf? - What - So he's an exact copy of you? - Well, not exact. I have to remain superior, so I bred out some of the intelligence, made him sort of a simpleton, you know? I call him Bitch Stewie. Would you like to meet him? - Would you like to meet Bitch Stewie? - Yeah. I guess. Bitch Stewie, come here and meet my friend, Brian. Hey there, Stewie. Oh! What's that? You got a friend? I'm always happy to meet one of your friends. - Dear God. - How do you do? Pleased to meet you. - I'm Bitch Stewie. - He's got quite a grip. Hey, Bitch Stewie. Why are there no midget accountants? Because they always come up short. Another good one, Stewie. I don't know where you come up with them. Isn't he wonderful? And all I have to feed him is a crude peanut paste. Watch this. It's not much, but it's healthier than what people ate in the '50s. - Steak and donut sandwich, please. - You want cigarettes on that sandwich? What do I look like, a Mary? Yes, I want cigarettes. Okay, next up on the stage, let's have a big karaoke welcome for Peter and Ron! Okay, this is one of our favorites. Hope it's one of yours. Don't go breaking my heart I couldn't if I tried Oh, honey, if I get restless Baby, you're not that kind Don't go breaking my heart You take the weight off of me Oh, honey, when I knock on your door Oh, I give you my Oh, sorry. I didn't realize somebody was in here What the hell? - Oh, hello, Brian. - Oh, there's your friend, Brian. Hey, Brian. I sure did enjoy talking to you the other day. I'm just making sure Stewie is nice and clean for his trip to the playground this afternoon. We had a little bit of a problem earlier because Bitch Stewie was stooling in the tub, wasn't he? I did some poos. I did some poos. I didn't mean to. But we've rectified that now and everything's fine. This is really weird. I mean, it's one thing to have him help you out with a busy schedule. It's another thing to let him wash your back. Well, he does more than that, Brian. Bitch Stewie, give me a bubble beard. Look at me. I'm George Bernard Shaw. That's awful funny, Stewie. I don't know who George Bernard Shaw is, but you look like an old Stewie, Stewie. Enjoy your weird bath. I told him I did the poos even though you did the poos, Stewie. Did I do good, Stewie? That was very correct of you, Bitch Stewie. You're a good helper. And what a lot of people don't know is that I was Jane Wyman's first. You might say I broke her Jane Wyman. - Reagan is a delight. - He sure is. And you know what else? The ghost of Reagan is gonna be the new fourth guy in our group. I'm all for that! What other stories you got, Reagan? Well, I remember the time I invited Ed Sullivan to the White House. He sounded a little something like this. Hey, Ron. Tonight, we got a really big show. - Reagan does impressions. That's right. And you know who else does impressions? Rich Little. In fact, you ought to go see his show at the Mohegan Sun casino next Saturday at 3:00 p. m. And 5:00 p. m. Wait a second. - Yeah, no shit. - What? Peter, that's not Ronald Reagan. That's Rich Little. You're Rich Little! He must be on his own ham radio. Well, you know, Ed, the kids say you got to go viral to promote yourself these days. So, this is not Reagan? No, it's Rich Little. He's an impressionist. He's been screwing with your head. Well, this thing is worthless. Like my Palestinian alarm clock. Allahu Akbar! - Hey, Peter. What's up? - Hey, Quagmire. Listen, I'm here to get my money back for that ham radio. Whoa, whoa, slow down there, partner. All sales are final. Yeah, but you were Agamemnon with me during the sale. - What? - I just saw that word somewhere. I wanted to use it. Look, Peter, why don't you just go home before you get hurt? Well, I'm clearly not the only one who was dissatisfied with his purchase. Whoever bought that baby from you obviously didn't want it. A baby? I didn't sell a baby. Look, there's a note. ""Glenn, this is your child. Next time wear a condom, jerk. "" - Oh, my God! - Wait. Now, hang on, Quagmire. - There's no guarantee it's your baby. - Giggity. Oh, I say that. Well, the DNA test results are back. This little girl is definitely your baby, Quagmire. What am I supposed to do? I don't want a baby. Look, somebody's got to take this kid off my hands. I can't be a father. Well, Glenn, you don't have a choice. This baby is your responsibility. Now, I brought you a basket of things to get you started. There's baby clothes, some toys, and some books. Now, if you have any questions, we're right across the street. Hey, what's going on? I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to do with you. There's some frozen steaks in the freezer. Bathroom's down the hall to the right. If you ever come home and there's a tie on the door, it means I'm frogging someone, so give me at least a couple hours. You smoke? Stewie, what are you doing here? I thought you were going to Bobby Stalling's birthday party. I hate that kid. And I hate children's birthday parties. I sent Bitch Stewie in my place. What a great little party, Janet. You know, I've never seen Stewie come out of his shell so much. Oh, no. It's not on his tail. It's on his face. I've ruined it. Oh, no. Well, that's okay, though. Somebody else will come along and get it right. Thanks for coming to my birthday party, Stewie. I wouldn't have missed it for anything. I've never been to a party before. Want to watch me blow out the candles? I would love to see that. And gosh, Bobby, I'd love to play with some of your birthday toys, but only after you've played with them and only if you say it's okay. You know, Stewie, I've got to say that clone of yours has come in pretty handy. It's a lifesaver, Brian, I'll tell you. I don't suppose you'd consider making one of those for me, would you? Maybe. What would you be willing to do for me? What do you want? Take your index finger and your thumb - and lightly grip the base of your tail. - What? Lightly grip the base of your tail with your index finger and your thumb, and then slide your fingers up the length of your tail to the tip. - Why? - Because that's what I asked you to do. That's kind of weird. Is this some kind of sexual thing? Nobody said anything about sexual. There's nothing sexual about it. I'm just asking you to perform a simple task. Take your index finger and your thumb and lightly grip the base of your tail, and run your fingers along the length of your tail. - You mean stroke it? - Nobody used that word. This is not a stroking motion. This is a completely nonsexual thing I am asking you to do in a completely nonsexual way. Squeeze the base of the tail lightly with your thumb and index finger. And then, while continuing to squeeze, run them up the length of your tail to the tip, and I'll make you a clone. - I only have to do it once? - I'll tell you when to stop. I don't know why you're stopping. Nobody told you to stop. Give me a little smile. Your lips look a little dry. Why don't you wet them a little bit? My God, you're so weird! All right, I'll make you a clone, buddy. She's a beautiful little girl, Glenn. Have you given her a name yet? Yeah, I named her Anna Lee, but I'm probably just gonna call her Annal for short. - That's funny. - Thank you. Anyway, thanks for all the baby stuff. What's that big tarp over there? That was Chris's blankie from when he was a baby. Yeah. He was a big kid. Almost split Lois in half coming out of her. It's true. I never mention this because I don't want him to feel bad, but after he was born, they had to rearrange most of my organs. Oh, yeah, he dragged half of Lois right out with him. Yeah, the doctor said I'll be lucky if I live past 50, but Chris is healthy and I thank God for that. Anyway, isn't this a beautiful little girl? Yeah, but she kind of stinks. Well, no wonder. She's pooped herself. - Ew! It's new car smell. - What? That's what a new car smells like. It's disgusting. Where are you buying your cars, Quagmire? I buy them online at poopcars. Com. Okay, well, I think I just solved the mystery. Oh, there you are, Brian. All right, you ready to meet your clone? Am I ever. I've got a to-do list three pages long for him. Okay. Now, I want to qualify this by reminding you that as with my clone, the intelligence level is reduced a bit. That's good. We don't want him thinking too much. Yeah, well, I might have dialed yours back a little more than I ought to have. - What do you mean? - Brian, meet Bitch Brian. Hi, Brian. You got some stuff you want me to do for you? Oh, my God. Yeah, that's kind of what I said, too. You know, I'll be honest with you, Brian. Here's what happened. I didn't really want to do the work, so Bitch Stewie sort of did it. Hey, Stewie. How'd the clone turn out? Brian, I can't go to the bathroom by myself. Will you please help me? But I'm good at other stuff. - Hello, Candy. - Hi, Glenn. Come on in. - So, how long you been in beauty school? - Two months. Well, tonight we're doing facials. Oh, God. Hang on a second. Okay, okay, stop. Just stop crying. Stop crying, Anna Lee. No wonder. You dropped your pacifier. - You have a baby? - Yeah, it's a long story. Damn kid's kept me up every night for two weeks. Now, where were we? Giggity Giggity Glenn, you fell asleep, so I took off. It's probably for the best. I've never had sex before, and I probably wouldn't have been much good at it. That's it. That kid is out of here. Hey, there's another note. ""Glenn, this is your child. Next time wear a condom "" Oh, that's the note from earlier. I need a file cabinet. So it's just not working out, me being a father. And that's why I'm wondering if you and Lois would be willing to adopt the baby. Oh, boy, Quagmire. I don't know that we can do that. We can barely take care of the two we have. Now, now, this is just a suggestion. Just throwing it out there. Have you considered abortion? Peter, I think it's too late for that. Don't let the press put the scare into you. Wade v. Boggs has not been overturned. Yeah, but you can't really abort a live baby. Oh, boy, they have got you. Glenn, Glenn Give her back to God. Peter, I'm gonna go ahead and move the conversation forward. Is there any way you guys could take Anna Lee? No, Quagmire. We got enough kids of our own. Plus old Brian over there. Right, buddy? I sharpened a pencil in my bum and now I need a Band-Aid. You're doing the right thing, Quagmire. All right, Quagmire, just so you're clear on the law. Once you give this child up to the adoption agency, you can no longer abort it. Hello, sir. Do you wish to put this child up for adoption? Yeah, it's not working out. I need to get her out of my hair. Well, we can help you there. Is it a boy or a girl? It's a girl. Her name's Anna Lee. Oh, beautiful name. Let me take her from you. Well, go on, Quagmire. Give her the baby. I will. I just Oh. Here. - She She'll go to a good home, right? - Oh, yes. She'll be somewhere safe, right? Like, you're not gonna put her with Sand People, right? - You mean, like from Star Wars? - No, no, no, no, no. Brian, I didn't know if you wanted a God's Eye, but I made you one. Okay, thank you. Did you wash my car like I asked? - No, but I hit it with a rock. - Okay, thanks. Brian, I think my jaw is falling off. Stewie, what is happening to this thing? Oh, yeah. Turns out the clones aren't too stable, Brian. I've been having some trouble with mine, too. Hey, Stewie. Everything sounds like rushing water, and I can't stand up so very good. Yeah, I figure they've got less than a minute before they dissolve completely. - Hey, Brian, knock-knock. - Who's there? Whoa! I hope that doesn't happen to me. He took my dry cleaning and I have no idea what he did with the ticket. Yeah, this was not a fruitful endeavor. You don't see my ATM card in there, do you? No. Do you want me to dig around and see if No, fuck it. It's fine. This'll be great, Quagmire. A nudie bar is the perfect way to celebrate your first night without a baby. Yeah, Peter. This is great. I feel like myself again. I'll tell you, my life was so dominated by that baby. I'm glad she's gone. Yeah. You know, sometimes you just got to make a decision and go with it. Like when I decided to try that radical penis enlargement. - Peter, I don't think - Brian, your objections are duly noted. Now, hit the gas. You know that would never work again in a million years. Don't need it to, Brian. That stripper has a rash on her ass just like Anna Lee used to get. Yeah. And that other stripper's sitting on that guy's lap - just like Anna Lee used to do. - I guess. And that stripper only has one tooth, just like Anna Lee. - Quagmire, you feeling okay? - I don't know. I think I might have made a terrible mistake. I abandoned my daughter. Why did I give away my only daughter? Oh, God! He'll be fine. We shouldn't let this ruin our night. - Let's just enjoy the strippers. - I guess. I just hate the way that one gets so into her work. You boys have been very naughty. I'm gonna have to assign you extra homework. Darn it. Fractions are so hard. - What did you get for number four? - She said don't share answers! All right, here it is. 625 Maple. That's the family that adopted Anna Lee. Hey, wait. Wait, guys! Well, it's just me and my old nemesis, First Step. Hey, Joe, what you doing? You out for a walk? I hate this block. There she is. There's Anna Lee. Hang on, Anna Lee. I'm coming. It's them. Look at her. She looks so happy. Almost like she belongs there. They look like a real family. I can't take her away from this. What's happening? He's not gonna go through with it. It's a nice family, and the kid'll be better off here. Oh, that's sweet! What's the inside of the house look like? Colonial. Furniture's pretty good. Possibly imported area rug. Oh, that's nice! A bit pricey, but for the money you're spending, you know, it's not a bad way to go! Yeah, for the money. You ready to go, Quagmire? Yeah. You know, I got to tell you. I think you did a good thing. Well, I guess I just realized it's not about me. This family is what's best for Anna Lee. This is her home now. I got to let her go. I'm proud of you, Quagmire. Thanks, man. Hey, who knows? Maybe I'll bump into her in 18 years. What? Did you really think I was gonna change that much? Good night, everybody! English - US - SDH"

We had to wait in line for, like, but then we made friends with the brown bouncer, and it was cool sailing from there. How's your friend search going? - Not great, Lois. - What friend search? We're just trying to find a friend to replace Cleveland. We've been meeting people for the past three days. Well, you don't need to look for somebody new. I'll hang out with you guys. Yeah. You know, I don't think that's gonna work out, Brian, 'cause of the whole Quagmire thing. - What Quagmire thing? - You know, just that he hates you. - Quagmire hates me? - Hates you. I don't get it. Why Why wouldn't Quagmire like me? Because he thinks you're annoying, like people who never shut up about their kids. He would have been four today. I still don't understand. How do you drown in an inch of water? Well, I guess I don't have a new sweater and a haircut. Who would have thought it would be this hard to replace Cleveland? You know, guys, we've kind of been ignoring the obvious here. I mean, if you really break it down, what we need is a black guy. Yeah, that was the best thing about Cleveland. Oh, by far. I sure do miss him. Peter's right! We got to find another black guy! Yeah, because otherwise, we're just a bunch of boring white guys, like a London gentlemen's club. Hey, you guys want to enter the darts tournament? First prize is free drinks all night. Well, we'd love to, Horace, but there's only three of us. Did I hear some sorry-ass fools in need of a mother-loving fourth? I'll join your darts game. How do we know you're any good? Gentlemen, we got us a black man. Oh, boy! What a fantastic evening! Jerome, you are a wonderful addition to our group. Hey, thanks, Peter. I like you guys, too. What do you say we hit another bar? Keep it going? I can't. There's a girl tied up in my basement who needs some food. That's funny. You funny, pointy man. Yeah. I joke around a lot. Well, I'm enjoying you, too, Jerome. Welcome to the clan. I mean, I'm glad we got to hang. I mean, you're a good negro. - No, I - Relax, man. I like you, too. Okay, yeah, that's all I was trying to Yeah, good evening. Thanks for the lift home, Jerome. Hey, if you got time to come in, I'd love for you to meet my wife. I got time for whatever I want, fool. My watch don't tell time. I tell it. Wow! You're cooler than a York Peppermint Pattie. When I bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, I get the sensation of being on a frozen mountaintop! It has been two months since I made the tragic choice to bite into a York Peppermint Pattie, and still I have made no progress finding my way out of the mountains. The only food I have is the rest of this York Peppermint Pattie, which, unfortunately, keeps bringing me back to the top of the mountain. If anyone finds this, tell my family I love them. of being on a frozen mountaintop! Hey, Lois, I'd like you to meet our new friend - Jerome? - Loose Lois? What? You guys know each other? Know each other? - Peter, Jerome is an old boyfriend of mine. - What? Sorry, I was out of it. Wait, are we being robbed? Peter, I know I told you about Jerome. Lois, I would have remembered if you had told me that. I told you, Peter. I remember exactly what we were doing. I slept with a black guy. I hope this doesn't make you feel awkward, my man. It was a long time ago. Hey, that's a beautiful baby. Mind if I hold him? Go right ahead. Hey there, little fellow. What's that around your neck? Well, I say! It's a little black Jesus. Black Jesus I rode into town on an ass, yo mama's ass. Black Jesus It was really good to see you, Lois. We should grab a coffee or something and catch up. Oh, that would be great. It was really nice to see you, too. Well, it's getting late, Jerome. I'm sure you've got stuff to do. Yeah. I got to go down to the gas station and buy a framed painting of a tiger. Catch you all later. You're not really gonna hang out with him, Lois, are you? We're just friends, Peter. Don't tell me you're jealous. Well, you dating that guy, it's just a lot to take in. Oh, you You're telling me. Come on! Those kinds of jokes aren't helping! Well, what do you want me to say? You're being silly. I mean, Jerome and I dated over 12 inches ago. I said ""inches. "" - What did I just say? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, look, just relax. You're my husband and I love you, so just put Jerome out of your head. Get him out of my life is more like it. Brian, I just found out Chris Farley died. Yeah, that happened, like, 12 years ago. But I just watched Tommy Boy yesterday. He was right there. Yeah, that's a movie. It's shot beforehand. It's not happening right now. Really? But I thought my knocking on the TV glass distracted him, and that's what made him fall down that hill. Seeing him fall down that hill put me in a good humor. Stewie, get lost. What are you doing just standing out here? I'm waiting for Quagmire to get his mail. I'm gonna conveniently stroll by and strike up a conversation with him, and maybe find out why he hates me. I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding. You'll smooth it over. Hey, Quagmire. What a coincidence! You and me just running into each other. How're you doing? Fine. Taking a break, huh? She's a hot piece of ass. And from the looks of it, she likes it rough. That's my sister, Brian. Her boyfriend has been beating her mercilessly. The last thing she'd want right now is to be objectified. Oh, God, I'm really sorry. I got a deaf brother! You want to make fun of him, too? Where is she? She's not here! Get out, Jeff! Just get out of here! I'll get out when I'm finished! You feel good about your sex joke earlier, Brian? He's savagely beating her again! You hear that? Yeah. I'm not deaf. What? Like my brother? Boy, you have no class! Yeah, that's the guy's brother, man. Yeah! Shut up, bitch! Hey, you know what they say. See a broad, to get that booty, yak them. Leg her down and smack them, yak them. Cold got to be. - Shit. - Lf you'll excuse me, I'm gonna order me some cheap cognac and put it in a fancy glass. Boy, Jerome is the greatest! We really lucked out. I don't know, you guys. I'm not so sure about Jerome. I mean, how do we know we can really trust him? What are you talking about, Peter? Jerome's awesome. Yeah. Why the hell wouldn't we be able to trust him? All right, you guys want the truth? Before me and Lois were married, our new friend used to slip her the old Pringles can. Well, so what, Peter? That was 20 years ago. That doesn't matter! Look, Peter. Jerome's the coolest guy we've met since Cleveland left. Yeah, don't do anything to ruin this, Peter. You know, the way you ruined my parrot. I just bought it yesterday. Isn't it beautiful? Cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple, cripple! - Cripple. - Damn it! That son of a bitch! Thinks he can sleep with my wife. Not on my watch! Listen, I don't care that you're dating Mallory. Nobody in this family likes you, Nick. You just stand your ground, garbage-sculpture man. They'll come to respect you. You bastard! Nick was no good for her and it broke Skippy Handelman's heart! Dear God and Black Jesus! Black Jesus The kingdom of God is inside you, at least it will be in a second. Black Jesus Jerome? What the What the hell are you doing here? Oh, Peter, something terrible's happened. Somebody burned down Jerome's house last night. This whacked-out world! It just makes you want to grab your nephew and get in a van and shoot people in the DC area. Yeah, well, when I find the guy who did it, I'm gonna rip his arms off and do his wife over and over nice and slow in front of him! And no one would blame you. But meanwhile, Jerome, you are more than welcome to stay with us. - What? - Oh! Well, thank you, Lois. Man, I'm so lucky to have real friends like you and Peter! Well, I guess you can stay here. But I'll tell you one thing Hang on a sec. - What is that? - I don't know. It's trying to do something. Oh. Well Well, I guess we're just gonna have to wait. So, how long is Jerome gonna be staying with us, Dad? I don't know, Chris, but the sooner he's out of here, the better. I don't trust him around Lois for a second! Oh, God, Jerome, that is so good! Yeah, it's so hot and moist! Mmm! These scones are delicious. You are quite the little baker, Jerome. - Oh, thank God! - What's going on in here? Relax, Mr. Furley. I thought what you thought, but it's okay. Well, it sounded like I know. I know, but it's fine. Go back to being dead. Peter, is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah, Lois. Everything's fine. You guys having a little breakfast? Yes, and Jerome made scones. Would you like one? Oh, they're delicious! I thought maybe later today, we could all Oh, my God! Mom's choking! Out of the way! I'm an EMT. Her airway's jammed. Come on now. Just like that. I need some gravitational help. Oh, no! Her clothes are constricting. As are mine! Oh, my God! Thank you, Jerome. You saved my life! Um, ""I'll have what she's having,"" says the funniest person in the room. Hey, what are you getting all dressed up for? I'm treating Quagmire to a night out. Really? I thought he hated you. How did you convince him to go? I tricked him, sent him a phony card. He thinks he's going on a date with an old girlfriend. - But instead, you're going to show up. - You got it. Yikes! That's a recipe for disappointment, like walking a floral arrangement through an office full of fat women. Is there a Miss es? - Oh. Brian? Where's Cheryl Tiegs? - Well, she's not coming. I wrote you that because I knew you'd never come if it was me. But I planned a big night, and we're gonna have a great time. Brian, Cheryl was the one that got away. She was the great love of my life. I thought this was my chance to finally achieve some real happiness. Ever since she left, I've been chasing girls to fill the hole she made when she walked out. Now I'm forever lost! Well, I bet a thick, juicy steak could help fill that hole, huh? Oh, come on! It'll be great. Listen, Glenn, I want us to be friends. I think we could be an even better team than Lewis and Clark and the guy who likes to rip up maps. - All right, the Northwest Passage. - Hey, could I see that? Damn it! You ass! - Easy, Clark. - I hate that guy! - It's been a long trip. You're tired. - No! I hate him! Look, you're angry. You're dehydrated. Just have some water from the canteen and you'll feel better. Okay. I just totally drowned this ant hill. Hey, when are we gonna get there? Ah! And this is Peter and I at our wedding. Oh, you look beautiful, and he's a handsome fellow, ain't he? Well, I am ready for my evening. Oh, my God! Peter, what the hell? Peter, what are you doing? Surely, Jerome, you don't want to stay in the same house as a ghost who carries a torch around? Fire ghost! You scared yet? Didn't know this place was haunted, did you? Peter, take that thing off! Hey, what the hell's going on? I'll tell you what's going on! I have had about enough of you, Jerome! I know you want my wife, but you can't have her! You are no longer welcome in my house! What you talking about, Peter? But you can't have sex with Lois! Now, I want you out of here right now! I can't believe this. I thought I found a true friend in you. I'd never do anything to hurt you or your family. Now you're breaking my heart. Jerome, wait. He doesn't know what he's talking about. I'm sorry, Lois. I think it would be better if I left. Peter, I'm sorry if I caused you any trouble. I won't be bothering you again. Wow! What just happened was kind of sad. So, whose leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here? Hmm. God! Look at the size of these steak knives. What are they serving us, Tyrannosaurus rex? Not likely. Hey, what if I just drank this whole bottle of ketchup? Can you imagine? You dare me? Kind of ruins it for the next person who might want some ketchup. - So, how's the flying business? - Not so great. The economy's sort of taking its toll. Lot of salary cuts. A lot of layoffs. - Yeah? - That's pretty much it. I mean, you want to learn more, read the papers, go on the Internet. I don't know. Boy, that's got to be an interesting job! I bet you got How do those things work? - What? Planes? How does a plane work? - Yeah. You want me to sit here and explain to you how a plane works? - I don't know. Yeah. - You want to maybe just go? Quagmire, come on! I'm really trying hard here. Who asked you to try hard? Nobody, but all I'm trying to establish a friendship with you. All I've done is try to be nice to you and you still don't like me. How can you not like me? Okay, I'll tell you. You are the worst person I know. You constantly hit on your best friend's wife. The man pays for your food and rescued you from certain death, and this is how you repay him? And to add insult to injury, you defecate all over his yard. And you're such a sponge. You pay for nothing. You always say, ""I'll get you later,"" but later never comes. And what really bothers me is you pretend you're this deep guy who loves women for their souls when all you do is date bimbos. Yeah. I date women for their bodies, but at least I'm honest about it. I don't buy them a copy of Catcher in the Rye and then lecture them with some seventh-grade interpretation of how Holden Caulfield was some profound intellectual. He wasn't! He was a spoiled brat. And that's why you like him so much. He's you. God, you're pretentious! And you delude yourself by thinking you're some great writer, even though you're terrible. You know, I should have known Cheryl Tiegs didn't write me that note. She would have known there's no ""A"" in the word ""definite. "" And I think what I hate most about you is your textbook liberal agenda. How we should ""legalize pot, man. "" How big business is crushing the underclass. How homelessness is the biggest tragedy in America. Well, what have you done to help? I work down at the soup kitchen, Brian. Never seen you down there. You want to help? Grab a ladle! And by the way, driving a Prius doesn't make you Jesus Christ. Wait! You don't believe in Jesus Christ or any religion, for that matter, because religion is for idiots! Well, who the hell are you to talk down to anyone? You failed college twice, which isn't nearly as bad as your failure as a father. How's that son of yours you never see? But you know what? I could forgive all of that, all of it, if you weren't such a bore. That's the worst of it, Brian. You're just a big, sad, alcoholic bore! I'll see you, Brian. Thanks for the fucking steak. Boy, it sure is nice having our house to ourselves again, huh? Lois? Peter, sometimes you just make me sick to my stomach. Look, I know you think Jerome was a good guy, but No. He was a good guy, Peter, and I'm gonna prove it to you. And you're gonna feel like a real jackass. - What's that? - It's a gift for you. You don't deserve it, but if anything, it's gonna wake you up a little bit. Jerome got you this as a thank you for letting him stay here. It's an actual prop from Family Ties. This is one of Nick's garbage sculptures. Yeah. Pretty thoughtful, isn't it? Oh, boy, do I feel like a jackass! Lois, I'm sorry. I just I let my jealousy get the best of me. Jerome's such a cool guy. And I guess I was worried he was cool enough to steal you away from me. You should know better than that, Peter. Now, I think you have an apology to make. Hey. You look like you could use a pal. Oh. Hi, Peter. Look, I'm sorry about how I acted. It's just Lois means everything to me. And when I saw you together, I didn't know what was gonna happen. I just thought you might try to mount her or whatever it is you guys do. Peter, how could you even think that? I would never do anything like that to you. You were my boy. We were like family. Yeah, I know. I messed up bad. I'm really sorry, Jerome. We're cool, Peter. We're cool. But, listen, there is something I got to fess up to. While I was living with y'all, I had myself lots of nasty-ass sex with Meg. I don't care about that. - Hey, Brian. How'd it go? - Fine. Have you been crying? What happened? It didn't work. He still hates me. Do you want to know something? That's okay. You don't need Quagmire to like you. You only need one person to like you, and that person is you. And I'll tell you something else. I like you. Thanks. - You want to sleep in my room? - Yeah. That'd be nice. - Good night, Brian. - Good night, Stewie. Oh, come on, man. English - US - SDH"

                    			Attention, everyone, mail call! Meg, Teen People, Chris, Amazing Spider-Man Lois, Redbook, World War II Army Guy, a letter from your gal. Open that one up, buddy. - All right, at ease, at ease. ""Dear Willy, it's been lonesome since you've been away."" You hear that, fellas? She misses me! You're all wet. Hey, check this out. We got invited to a party. ""Peter Griffin, you and your family are cordially invited to a gala dinner in your honor at Rocky Point Manor."" - What? What are they honoring you for? - Who cares? It's for the whole weekend. And it's free. - Well, who's the invitation from? - It doesn't say. You're not gonna go, are you? It's clearly some kind of scam. Then maybe we just go, and you go to the kennel. Not the kennel. Last time you left me there for an hour. Or 10 years, I don't know. There's no clock. You stink when you come out of there. We're going and that's that. I'm gonna ""rsvp."" - You mean RSVP? - Hillary Clinton's the VP. No, she's Secretary of State. - Rhode Island. - What? - I don't understand what's happening. - We're going to a party. Yay! Wait, who the hell lives all the way out here, huh? Lois? Oh, you're asleep. Kids? Anybody awake? Just me? Huh? Oh. I'm the only one awake. Just me. Peter. I can do whatever I want. Maybe I'll try out some of my funny voices. Hi, partner, I'm a cattle rustler. I rustle cattle. Oh, well, that's turning out good. Gotta use that. Oi. Oi, oi, mate. It sure is not so very nice in this part of London. Oh, wow, that one's really good. Go ahead and keep that one to myself. How bad would I kick myself if someone ran off and made millions with that? Hey, uh Hey, hey, everybody. Hey, there. What's this one? Who's this guy? Who am I? I need a character. I need a back story. I'm a I'm a pie-man. I sell pies. Oh, man, see, this is why I wish I had more time to myself. I know these are good because I'm my toughest critic. Dad, are we almost there? Shit. Uh, yeah. According to the map, we're pretty close. Peter, look. My God, this is absolutely beautiful. I bet Jeff Probst has a house like this. - Joe? - Peter? What are you guys doing here? We got an invitation to a dinner in my honor. I assumed it was for all those arrests I made last month. Weird. My invitation said it was in my honor. I assumed it was for being able to fart the alphabet. Which I almost did till I pooped on the S. Ah, well. Everybody on the bus was upset long before that anyway. What the? Derek and Jillian? - Wow. Hi, Brian. - Hey, kiddo. - What are you guys doing here? - I got a card that says they're throwing a dinner in my honor. What the hell's going on here? Everybody got the same invitation? Muriel, if you're not gonna eat your half of the cheeseburger I'll see if they have a freezer so I can keep it nice. I'm gonna walk around, I think my vagina's asleep. Oh. Hey. Uh Didn't think I'd see anyone I knew here. This, uh - This is Stephanie. - Hi, everybody. Oh, my gosh! I never thought I'd meet Glenn's friends. Yeah, I figured, why not? You know, you and I see each other from time to time. Oh, my God, we, like, never see each other. This guy. You, like, disappear for a month, and then you call me? So silly. You're lucky I like you so much. Okay, why don't you go ahead and take the bags in? Wow, it looks like the whole town got invited. Mr. Peter, Mr. Joe, Mr. Bonnie. She doesn't know what ""Mr."" means. Mr. Mort. Mr. Muriel. Mayor West Mister. Oh, my God, seriously. I know what you're all thinking, but fear not, citizens. While I'm enjoying myself at this festive get-together I've left the city in the capable hands of the Mayor-O-Matic 5000. Take a letter, hold my calls. That's a matter for the Parks Department. If you will all please follow me to third floor, I show you to your rooms. You are all expected for dinner at 8:00. Oh, good. I'm starved. Settle down, will you? None of this makes any sense. Everyone got invitations from an anonymous source for a dinner in their honor, when that's clearly not the case. Now we're here, where the hell's our host? At least you all had evening wear provided for you. I thought this was a lawn party. I don't have one pair of long pants. It's kind of awkward seeing Jillian here with Derek. Wonder if she's thinking about me. I don't know. Are you a pony or the color blue? - Derek, look. - Huh. How do you like that? Have you guys ever seen Jim Henson's Labyrinth? No. Have you seen the Channel Five News? - No. Uh, Labyrinth has teenage Jennifer Connelly. Channel Five News has file footage of pills being sorted. People think Jennifer Connelly's old now and that her hands look like two bags of snakes. - I think that's bogus. - I don't think we have much in common. - You watch NCIS? - Yes, sir. Yes, I do. - CBS knows what we want. - Yeah, they get our generation. They do. They really do. - I switch over for the Leno though. - Yeah, me too. I'm glad he's back. I don't know who that month-old jack o' lantern was but I didn't get this brand of humor. Good heavens, Meg, you're sprouting up like a weed. I know. She's growing every day. - Meg, you remember Dr. Hartman? - Of course she does. I performed her very first pelvic exam. Unless I'm confusing you with someone else. Nope. That was That was you. Good evening, everyone. James Woods. Thank you for joining me at my humble manor. I'd like to introduce you to my lovely companion, Priscilla. Nice to meet you all. - Who's he? - James Woods. Oh, I thought he was a shark. No, he was a on a show called Shark. - But he's made of wood? - No, his last name is Woods but he's not made of wood. Nobody is. This truly is a night to celebrate, especially for me. What's going on here, Woods? The invitation said this was a dinner in my honor. - That's what mine said too. - Me too. - Mine too. - Same here! Where's the food? - Actually, this dinner honors all of you. Where should I begin? You see, recently I've become a born-again Christian. Thanks to this beautiful little angel. She came into my life as if out of nowhere enchanted me beyond my wildest dreams and opened my eyes to the cleansing truth of Jesus Christ's love. Oh, honey, it was always within you. I just helped you find it. Um, what does all this gay stuff have to do with us? The fact of the matter is I have wronged each and every one of you in some way. And, since I am a man of God now, I am truly repentant. So I invited you all here to make amends. Why the hell should we trust you? You've been terrorizing our family for years. I understand that there is some healing to do here tonight and I am prepared to be patient. Please, won't you just give me a chance? And I promise you won't be disappointed. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll just go check on dinner. Oh, I'll help you, sweetheart. - This is all very strange. - I agree. Something's not right. I don't know, maybe we should give him a chance. Maybe he really is born again. Well, he could be. It all depends on what his astrological sign is. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I'm very intuitive with these things. Maybe if I sit in his chair, I can get a reading on his energy. I mean, if he's an Aquarius a rebirth would not be unexpected. - That's enough, Stephanie. You know, It's like when I did Glenn's star chart. Did the? Did the cork hit me? My God. She's dead. She's been shot. I can't help feeling this would be sadder if she wasn't heavy. Oh, my God. It was him. It was James Woods. He killed her. Jesus, I knew he was crazy, but I didn't think he was a murderer. Oh, he must've brought us here to kill us all. Run! Run for your lives! We gotta get out of here. Come on, get in the car. - Oh, my God, Peter, back it up! - Oh, really, Lois? I thought I might drive forward. That might be a fun thing to do. Stop fighting! Quick, Peter, get in the back. Oh, thank God. We made it. My neck. You backed into me, and now Oh! And your back. - And my back. My back, yes. Oh. All right, it looks like we're stuck here. Storm has flooded the causeway, and the bridge is destroyed. For the moment, there's no way out. No Way Out, great film. Sean Young naked in the limo. - Well, maybe the storm will let up soon. - I don't know, it's a hard rain. Christian Slater, Morgan Freeman. ""We just want the money."" We should have known this was coming. There's been three days of thunder. Tom Cruise, race cars. Those are my bed sheets. What are we gonna do? We can't stay here with James Woods lurking somewhere in the house. Does anyone have a cell phone? - I'm not getting any reception. - Me neither. - No bars! - It's all right. I'll put a message in a bottle. Now we wait. - Look, he's got a landline we can use. - Oh, no. I wouldn't feel right about that. We're guests, and it's long distance. Doesn't matter. The line's dead. Oh, my God! Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right. Look, everybody but Chris just keep your pants on and let's figure a way out of this. He's right. We gotta stay calm. - With a killer in the house? - Killer in the house. Oh, my God. I just realized something. James Woods hates me the most. That means he's probably gonna kill me next. Well, I reckon if I was a cattle rustler, I wouldn't be afraid. - Oh, Peter, that's good. - I know, Lois. Hey, guys, has anybody seen James? Sweetheart, you may wanna sit down for this. Who want little tiny tacos? Oh, little taco. I'll have one of those. - It's him! - Sorry I took so long. I was going to the bathroom, and I just couldn't stop looking at my penis because it's, you know, so fantastic. You're a I heard it's fantastic. You're a monster, James Woods! You think you can commit murder and get away with it? - Quagmire loved that girl. Easy. Murder? What are you talking about? You're going away for a long time, pal. - Jimmy, what does he mean? - I don't know what's going on here. Maybe that dead pile of cookie dough in the next room will refresh your memory. What do you mean? There's nothing in the next room. It's gone. Where is she? What'd you do with the body? What body? You know, maybe she wasn't dead. I'll admit it, I'm not great with that stuff. I don't know what's happening here, but look, I'm a lot of things. A member of Mensa, a huge hit with the ladies. Someone who would have broken out bigger if he weren't so impossible to work with. But a murderer? I only just found God. Why would I jeopardize my entrance into heaven? If I were you, I'd keep your mouth shut till you talk to a lawyer. I didn't kill anybody. Oh, my God. Is this what black people see all the time? Look! He's dead. - Oh, my God. - Nice. Nobody touch the knife. There could be fingerprints on it. So James Woods murdered Stephanie, and then he murdered himself. - Criss-cross. - Oh, Peter. Don't you see? He didn't kill himself, and he didn't kill Stephanie. - What are you saying? - James Woods isn't the murderer. The murderer is one of us. And someone ate the last goat cheese tartlet. Now I hope I die next. Okay, everyone, it's important that we all stay calm. How are we supposed to stay calm? There's a killer in the room. We all gotta get out of here. We're gonna die. Mr. Mayor, pull yourself together. Wait a minute. Joe, look. Oh, my God. - Stephanie was an accident. - That's a way of putting it. What do you mean, Joe? This gun was timed to fire at that chair where James Woods would have been sitting. But he left, and Stephanie was in the wrong place at the wrong time. So whoever the murderer is, they were after James Woods, not Stephanie. The question is, who here wanted James Woods dead? Let's look around and see if we can find any more clues. Oh, my God. I feel like everyone's wondering why I'm wearing shorts. - Nobody's even looking at you. - That's what I mean. The fact no one said anything makes it even more obvious everyone noticed. Brian, look what I found! Check it out. I'm a robot from outer space. Hang on. I'm coming down. Go, go, gadget skis. Uh-oh. All right, since it's my fault that Joe got knocked out it is now my responsibility to take over the investigation. - I don't know if that actually follows. - It does follow, Brian. Because I'm the one with the giant magnifying glass. - Is my eye big? - Yeah. Good. Good. That means progress. Let's figure out what we know here. The gun was meant to kill Jimmy Woods, but Stephanie got in the way. So the murderer had to improvise and finish the job by stabbing Jimmy Woods. - What? What? What is that? - What? Don't call him Jimmy Woods like you're in the Hollywood set. Brian did one TV pilot and he thinks he can call the star of Cape Fear Bobby Di Niro. - Who's the director, Brian? - Marty Scorsese. - Star of Silence of the Lambs? - Tony Hopkins. - Who sang ""Hold On To The Night""? - Dick Marx. Who's the cast of Miami Vice? Donny Johnny, Philly Mikey Tommy and Eddie Jimmy Olmos. Ugh. You are You are just douchey to the core. Whoever the killer is, they had a reason for wanting James Woods dead. Now, who here has a motive? Well, according to James Woods, we all did. He brought us here to make amends. But he wronged one of us enough to want revenge. The question is, who? Well, I know one person who could have. My partner Tom. All right, it's true. James Woods ruined my career. I originally wanted to be an actor. I booked the lead role in Nightmare On Elm Street. James Woods said, ""No, don't bother. Something else will come along."" So I turned it down. And now this Robert Englund is the talk of the town. That should be me everyone's talking about. Oh, my God, you guys, we must've fallen asleep. We're in a dream right now. That's right, you are in a dream, children. Which means you are going to get something of a serious scratching by me. Freddy Krueger. Ha, ha. Is it? Is it Krueger? Was I angry? Yes, of course. But I didn't kill him. What about Seamus? You hated James Woods. You told me so. Aye, he's the one who made me what I am today. I wish you were a real, live ornery sea captain. But he didn't wish hard enough. It only worked on me head. - Oh, my God. Seriously? - No, I was a normal guy until one night we dropped acid together and he thought I was a steak. Grilled me, ate my arms and legs. It was a whole thing. But I'm not the killer. What about the mayor? He could have killed him and got off scot-free! He took the Twitter name Mayor West so now I have to use Mayor underscore West. That rat-faced cracker. But you hated him too, Dr. Hartman. He switched around all the bones on the skeleton in my office. I don't know what's what anymore. Let's take a look at that wrist injury. That's my foot, not my hand. Woods! Sure, I hated him, but so did Mort. He's terrible. He took a Penthouse into the pharmacy bathroom and left this little handy work in the sink. He's a dirt bag. But I didn't kill him. Maybe it was Diane. James Woods promised to introduce me to Dan Rather. But instead, he introduced me to Danny Bonaduce. I tell you, that guy looks like a dog turning 30. What about the old guy? I heard him complaining about Woods in the dining room. That's true. He replaced my Cialis with methamphetamines! - Pedal faster. - I can't go any faster. Where you going, kids? I want to talk to you. Come to my place for a glass of wine and fruit pies. And then we can go in the back room and play crazy snakes. Hee-hee-hee-hee! Hey, wait. What about those two European guys? They really hated James Woods. Where the hell are they? Oh, we've been invited to a party in our honors. But it was for this week after's. Why aren't we there? It was wedged in our post pail. And what about Quagmire? Fine. So he stole Cheryl Tiegs from me. - He ruined your TV pilot. - I backed out of that project willingly. Oh, yeah, that's what every hack says. You know, Brian Eh. My secret room's bigger. Mine's smaller. All right, stand back. This could be dangerous. Oh, laundry room. Laundry room, everybody. Oh, see, here we go. Aha. James Woods made a list of all his misdeeds so he could make amends. He punched you in the throat, and that's why you sound like that? No, he punched me in the throat because I sound like this. And Consuela, he I can't read his handwriting here. What happened? One day, I bring my nephew to work, and he molest my nephew and my nephew, he only 14, and he cry and then he shoot himself in the face. He also has a list of good restaurants up and down the Eastern Seaboard. Peter, one of the people in this room is a murderer. And 19 of us are not. Maybe we wanna know a good bed and breakfast in Maine. What are all these? God, there are tons of OxyContin bottles in here. All prescribed to James Woods. And all from Goldman's Pharmacy. - What's that all about? - I don't know what you're talking about. James Woods never bought anything in my pharmacy. Ever. Yes, he did. Says here he talked Muriel into selling him OxyContin for him and his 19-year-old girlfriend. This went on for weeks. She started to have misgivings and threatened to cut him off. He wouldn't let her. He threatened to blackmail her by turning her in to the feds. Sounds like a pretty good motive to me. Oh, Muriel, tell me this isn't true. - I overcharged him. - I forgive you. Look, why would I kill him anyway? He told us he was here to make amends. But there was a chance he'd blab, wasn't there? No! No, it's not true! I would never kill anybody, never! And I am not saying another word until I talk to my lawyer, because Why is he wearing shorts? Oh, my God, I told you. Muriel, just surrender quietly. It'll be easier for us all if you She's gone. - We lost her. - There's a murderer on the loose. None of us are safe. All right, let's split up and search the house. I'll go with Lois. Chris, you check the basement with Herbert. - Meg, you go with Brian and Stewie. - Uh, no, she can't. Yeah, uh, she can't. We were gonna use this time to figure out what to get you for your birthday. Ah, okay. Oh, yeah, no, you guys go. Now I'm excited. Okay, uh, Meg, you go with Carl. Sorry, Carl. Tom and Diane, you're a team. Quagmire and Bonnie. Um, Seamus and Dr. Hartman? That could be funny. Don't usually see you together. Uh, Derek and Jillian, take the attic. Joe and Priscilla are passed out. They'll be the unconscious team. And that leaves one three-person team of Mort, Consuela, and Mayor West. All right. Let's do this. So, uh, you guys like to party? - No. - Oh, no. Oh, my God, what a couple of squares. Squaresville, I tell you! - What are we supposed to be doing? - We're looking for Muriel Goldman. Hello? Is anybody up here? Hey, maybe it was that cat who was the murderer. Let me ask him. Meow meow meow? Meow meow meow meow? We don't all talk like that. I happen to be a professor. - Our apologies, sir. - I should imagine so. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have papers to correct. Chris, I'm worried with this killer on the loose. If I should die, I just want you to know that they might find some things. Strange things. - Things that don't make sense to you. - Um, okay. And there's gonna be a lot of talk. Nasty talk. And I just want you to know, from me, it's all gonna be out of context. I don't know what that means. It means, if I die, you gotta burn my house down. Oh, sweet, a pool table. Let's see if we can find some cues. - What is it? - Phew. It's okay. It's just the stuffed bear from The Great Outdoors. - Did you see The Great Outdoors? - No. - You suck. - Hey, I found the pool cues. Meg? Looks like I'm all alone. Well, hey, that's all right. I watch a lot of movies. I can just use my imagination. - Hi, Carl. - Hey, bear. So, um, in the bear world are, like, pandas your version of interracial children? Yeah, pandas aren't something I agree with. - They're cute, though, right? - Just when they're babies. Muriel? Muriel? Muriel? - Nothing. - You know what she smells like? I know what everybody smells like. - Carl? - Cheetos. - Mort? Derek? - Pennies. Brut. - Joe? Consuela? - Feces. Pledge. - Seamus? Quagmire? - Wood. Wood. Wow. I have to admit, before this Muriel thing I thought you might be the murderer. Oh, my God. So insulted. Trust me, if this were my work, it would be much more artful. There's a poetry to what I do. - You know how I would've killed James? - How? I would have electrocuted him causing a temporary paralysis. While he was still conscious but unable to move I would've reached into his anus and pulled out his lower intestine. Hand over hand, like a fancy magician's scarf trick. Then I would fashion the intestine into a crude giraffe and give it to his children as a Christmas stocking stuffer. Then as his eyes start to close in final submission to death's cold embrace I'd point to the ceiling and say, ""Is that your card?"" And stuck to the ceiling is the card that he picked earlier. Oh, I forgot to tell you, he picked a card. - Wow, you're an artist. - Oh, thanks, you're nice. I screwed that up. Muriel? Oh, yeah, like she's gonna answer you, Tom. And here we go with the attitude. This is why you're single. Oh. So I'm not supposed to point out when you do something stupid? You hear that tone you're using? That's penis repellent right there. Careful. She could be hiding behind any one of these statues. Muriel, this is Tom Tucker from the Channel Five news. - Perhaps you'd like an autograph. - For God's sakes. Do you hear yourself? There it is. Knock it off! Hey, wait a minute. Doesn't feel like there's any wall here. - What do you think's in there? - I don't know. Looks scary. What do you think, Ollie? I miss Ollie. - I better take a look. - No. I'll go first. - Do you see anything? No, it's It's too dark. Tom? Tom! - Boy, it's really raining hard. - Yeah, well, we needed it. - What? - Peter, we've been married a long time. Why do I still get ""guy in an elevator"" small talk? I don't know. You're the one talking about the weather. So looking forward to the weekend? It's okay. It's just us. Oh, Quagmire, Bonnie, you scared us. Have you seen any sign of Muriel? Why didn't I think of this before? I should just check the ""Find a Jew"" app on my iPhone. Huh. There's just two big clusters on each side of the country. No, look. There's one down south. Oh. They got him. Be careful. Muriel could be in any one of these pantries. Dr. Hartman? Doctor? Okay, quit messing around. Dr. Hartman, this isn't funny. You bastard! You should've seen your face. That's so not funny. Now I gotta empty my pants. - What's that? - Acorns. - Acorns? - Acorns, that's what I said. - We sound too much alike. - I know. Okay. Um Oh, uh, Lost in Space. Yup, okay. Um Oh, that's Dick Van Dyke. Okay, um Okay, I got one. Um I have no idea. Linda Evans and John Forsythe They're coming down big, long stairs Come on, Brian, you know this We're all rich And we're all at least in our late 50s Think Joan Collins Come on, Brian, you know this It's the middle trumpet part It was a pretty big deal For Diahann Carroll To play a rich black woman in the 80s Come on, Bri. Right? You don't know this? - Falcon Crest? - Oh, it's Dynasty! Oh. Yeah, l I didn't watch that. Aah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Muriel. My sweet Muriel. She was so young. She was so beauti She was so gener We were married. Look. This is the same knife that killed James Woods. Oh, my God. Then Muriel wasn't the killer. Well, then, who is? I don't know, but one thing's for sure. If we don't find out before this storm lets up we're all gonna be dead by morning. If we're gonna make it out alive, we gotta stick together from now on. - Is everyone here? - Wait a minute. Where's Meg? - And where's Tom Tucker? - Right here. Oh, my God. What happened? I fell through a trapdoor that led to an underground passageway. So I followed it, and it led me to a hatch in the parlor. The same thing happened to me. But with a mustache. Let's do a count, make sure we're here. Check in by team name and I hope you all came up with cool team names. - The Bushmen are here. - Pirates here. - The Tigers are here. - We're also the Tigers. - We're called Bad News. - We're Lilo and Stitch. We're Boys II Men. Hey, Peter, look at this. I'm getting a faint signal on my cell phone. Really? Oh, my God, is that? Are you holding up the whole Hollywood sign? No, no, no. The sign was way in the background. I was standing in the foreground like this when Jillian took the picture. So by forced perspective, it looks like I'm holding up the sign. I don't believe you. I think you are a god. And I will die for you or kill others. Damn it! The signal's gone. If I can get up to the roof or something maybe I can get a stronger signal and call the police. Okay. And I will skin this dog in your honor. - Please don't. - As you wish. Do you really think it could work, Derek? - There's only one way to find out. - I'll come with you. No, it's too dangerous. Especially with Derek Jr. on the way. Aw. Ha, ha. I know. It's a little early to announce it but you're all friends. Except one of you who's killing us. But everyone else is our friend. - Oh, congratulations, Jillian. - I know. I'm eating number two now. Eating for two, honey. I'll be back. All right, nobody leaves this room until he gets back. Wait a minute. Something's not right here. We're short one vagina in this room. Oh, my God! Priscilla's gone! Th That's impossible. She was still passed out on the couch when we left. - What the hell happened? - Joe! You're okay! - I'm fine. What's going on? - What's going on is Priscilla's the murderer. - We don't know that. - She was by herself this whole time. - But she was unconscious. We don't know how long she was unconscious. - She could've killed Muriel. - This is all speculation. - We don't know if she's the killer. - Besides, she's hot. Hot chicks are never crazy. Derek lifted up the Hollywood sign. He did too. I saw the picture. Don't touch me! Come on. Yes! Hey, what are you doing up here? Wait a minute. What the hell is this? Oh, my God. It's you. The man or woman who's been killing everybody. Stay back. Stay back. It came from over there. Dear God! He's dead. - Do you think he slipped off the roof? - Maybe. But he was dead before the fall. Look at this. He's been hit on the head by a blunt object. Oh, my God, no, Derek! Oh, Jillian, I'm so sorry. Grab his phone. I wanna prove something to these guys. It's Priscilla. It's gotta be Priscilla. She's the only one who's not here. Maybe, maybe not. We thought Muriel was the killer. Look how that turned out. We have no proof. Is this the latest you've ever stayed up? It's the latest I've ever stayed up. Oh, no. Someone take Mr. Woods' Golden Globe. She's right. There was a Golden Globe here, and it's gone. I think we may have identified our blunt object. Is very important award. No, no. Actually, if I can clarify this, it's not a very important award. Okay? Here's how the Golden Globes work. Want a Golden Globe? Take a member of the Foreign Press to lunch and they'll vote for you. Hmm? That's all you gotta do. And there's only like 30 guys in the Foreign Press. So it's relatively easy to buy one of those things, okay? You with me, America? You with me? So let's all shut the fuck up about the prestige of these things because it's just It's a sale, you know? You might as well walk into a Zales and say: ""File me up one of these and I'll pay you the price of a bacon burger."" Okay? We all clear on what the Golden Globes are? All right? Now, that said, if anyone from the Paris Observer would like to have lunch, it's on me. Ha, ha. All we have to do is find that Golden Globe and we have our murder weapon. If we're lucky, it may just mean we'll have our killer. All right, from this moment forward nobody leaves the group. Joe's right. Everyone huddle up. Good. Now we're gonna search the house, and we're gonna move as one. Anyone who separates from the group we will assume to be the killer. - All clear? Yeah. All right. Let's do this. Guys, uh, we're stopping at the bathroom first, okay? So if you're not comfortable with me as a person please circulate yourselves to the uh Right, here we go. Stand back, I got a full bladder. I gotta go too. You wanna have a sword fight? Ooh, I want in on that. Me too. Is okay, I clean. Oh, boy, we got a problem here. All right, on the count of three. One, two, three. Thanks, guys. Stop it, Peter. - Peter, knock it off. - Okay, Jew Joe. Shut up! I'm not Jewish! Well, I think we've learned a little something about our friendly neighborhood policeman today. We gotta search every one of these rooms. We'll start with Quagmire's. Oh, my God! Are those Stephanie's underpants? - Oh, Jesus. - They're huge. Looks like the crotch got chewed on by a walrus mouth. Ha, ha. Look, it's got flowers. I mean, why bother? Who's gonna see them? Maybe someone in space. Come on, guys, can't we all just be glad she's dead? - Whose room is this? - It's, uh, my room. You travel with a giant poster of yourself? Yes. It helps me get to sleep, knowing that Big Tom Tucker is keeping a watchful eye out for nocturnal intruders. What a ridiculous man you are. I didn't know my room was gonna be scrutinized. - lf you don't like it, let's get out of here. - Not till we've searched the place. You guys? Oh, my God! Well, well, I think we've found our killer. Now, wait a minute, that's not mine. I suppose it crawled under your bed all by itself. Well, maybe it did. I didn't murder anybody. Tell it to Mike Judge. Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is crazy. What about Priscilla? We have no idea where she is. She could've planted that. Well, I suppose it's possible. What the hell? - Ah, dang it, I got a nosebleed. - No, you don't. Peter, give me a boost. - You're going to jail, Tucker. - Like hell I am. You're not taking me anywhere, you Podunk, Quahog redneck cop. Not you or anyone else in this damn town. I'm not going to jail. After him. - Give it up, Tucker. - Make me, Swanson. Damn, he's slippery. You guys give up? - What do we do? - Wait a minute, guys. - I got an idea. - Shoot. Half of us go around one side. The other half go around the other side. - Then we won't chase him in circles. - Damn, that's awfully risky. It sure is, but at this point, I'm willing to try anything. All right. Let's do it! It worked. Let me go. Let me go, you bastards. You're all gonna pay for this. Just for that, when the movie of this story comes out I'm gonna make sure Adrien Brody plays you. I guess that means you don't want anyone to see it. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot for your help, boys. - Nice work, Swanson. - Thank you, Mr. Mayor. It just goes to prove even the most trusted member of our community can snap and become a psychopathic killer. You never know who's lurking out there in your neighborhood. When we all see each other at school on Monday are we still gonna be friends? Despite all the craziness this weekend I feel like a lot of people were looking at me like I was attractive. Which makes me think I'm gonna grow up to be good-Iooking. What part of that is supposed to lure me into a conversation? I talk to you about wet tennis balls. - Oh, come on. - We're in a fight. Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels in the bath Lois? Lois? Lois? Lois, are any of my Hot Wheels in the bathroom? I put them all in your bag. I don't see the fire engine but I guess we'll just find out when we get home, won't we? I'll see you in the car. - Hi, Diane. - Oh, hi, Lois. How you doing? I just thought I'd make sure you were okay. Oh, I'm managing. It's just so hard to believe you can work with someone for 15 years and yet have no idea who they really are or what they're capable of. Oh, I know. And I'm sorry. So, what happens now? Will you just anchor the news by yourself? I suppose, for the time being. Well, that's kind of exciting, right? You sound like my mother. She actually bought me this blouse for my first solo broadcast. I guess that's sweet, huh? She - I'm sorry, I don't understand. - What do you mean? How could she have known you'd be anchoring alone? I mean, none of this happened until Uh, gosh, I, uh You know, I think I'd better, uh, go make sure Peter has his, uh, fire engine. Oh, really? But I was enjoying our talk. Oh, no, l So was I, but, you know. I've Really, I should I should go. No. I don't think so. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it was you. You're the killer. Very clever, Lois. You shouldn't have stopped to say hi. You would've lived longer. Why do I ever try to be friends with other women? But, Diane, why? How could you do all these horrible things? Well, I suppose it all really began a year ago when James Woods and I met at a press event and began seeing each other. We both valued our privacy so we agreed to keep it a secret from the media. Everything in my life was wonderful. But then a few months ago, I turned 40. Surprise! It was hard for me to begin with but it got worse when, not so coincidentally Tom began pushing Channel Five News to replace me with a fresh, young face. And he succeeded. Three weeks from now, I'll be off the air. Well, apparently, all men think the same way because around the same time, James dumped me. I watched my career and my love life crumble and I wasn't gonna just stand by and take it. That's when I had the good fortune to meet a young news intern named Priscilla. She was so anxious to get into reporting and would have done anything to get on my good side. So I seized the moment. I paid her off to seduce James Woods and reel him into a relationship like a fish on a line. I knew a hot, young woman like Priscilla could manipulate him into doing anything I wanted. At my direction, she persuaded him to become a born-again Christian and instilled him with the drive to bring together all the people he'd wronged. That's how this weekend came to pass. Of course, Priscilla knew nothing of my real intentions but she played the part beautifully, nonetheless. There's no way she could've known I planned to kill James Woods and frame Tom Tucker thereby destroying the two people who cast me aside and ruined my life. Oh, my God. - You're 40? - Yes. I'm 40. But then why did you kill the others? It was all supposed to go so smoothly. The hidden gun goes off kills James Woods, and at the first opportunity I retrieve the gun and plant it in Tom's bag. James Woods is dead, Tom goes to prison. Nice and easy. But Stephanie got in the way. She was in James' chair at the wrong time. And when I realized my mistake, I had to improvise. The power outage provided a perfect cover. I grabbed the knife off the dinner table and stabbed him. But as Joe pointed out, there were fingerprints. I couldn't just leave it there. So when Tom and I got separated in the gallery I went back into the dining room and got the knife. At that moment, Priscilla regained consciousness after fainting. She started to become hysterical. I couldn't risk her revealing that I had engineered this whole gathering so I killed her. And I hid her in Tom's room. I tried to plant the knife in Tom's suitcase but at that moment, Muriel walked in and caught me in the act. It wasn't her fault, poor thing, but she had to die. I stabbed her and she screamed. I had to leave the knife because I couldn't hide it on my person with everyone quickly closing in. So I wiped off the fingerprints and ran. I slipped in with the rest of the group, when they all converged on the scene. I needed more time to finish my work framing Tom. But that's when Derek went out to the balcony. I couldn't let him contact the police before everything was in place. So I had to kill him too. When Peter was yelling about that picture of Derek holding the Hollywood sign I grabbed the Golden Globe and slipped out. I followed Derek outside and did what I had to do. I barely had time to plant the Globe in Tom's room and run back downstairs where I took advantage of the commotion and joined the crowd as they were all running outside. And the rest, well, you did all the rest for me. You turned on Tom exactly as I planned. - So there it is, Lois. - My God. But wait, there's one thing unaccounted for. What happened to Stephanie's body? Actually, that's the one thing I don't know. Damn it! Well, now you know everything, Lois. Which, of course, means I have to kill you. Lois, you coming? I can't play my tapes without the key. Actually, Lois and I were just about to go for a quick walk, weren't we, Lois? - We've been getting better acquainted. - Just give me the key. All right, Peter, I'll get it. Don't put a gun in my back. I'm not. I'm just asking for the key. Peter, we've been married 20 years. Please recognize when I'm acting out of the ordinary because I'm in danger. Here you go. Here's the key, Pete. Why's she calling me Pete? We been married 14 years. She never called me Pete. Why figure this out when I could listen to my tapes in the car? Bye. Shall we? Well, it's a shame that you have to die, Lois but look on the bright side. You'll be a story on the 6:00 news. You know, unless a local cat does something funny. Diane, please. Please, don't do this. I won't tell anybody, I swear to God. That's right. You won't. Goodbye, Lois. Hello? Is anyone there? Whoever you are, thank you. If anybody's gonna take that bitch down, it's gonna be me."

Would you read to find the page with the bologna? - Okay, look, I'll read four pages tonight. All right, four pages. That's it. And maybe more if tonight's episode of The Office ends up sucking. Ah. Four pages. Done. Moving on. I know my staplers by sound and by weight. And that stapler, good sir, is a Schrute. Ha! Look at John Krasinski look at the camera. He can't believe this guy. But there were gonna be more high jinks in Scranton. Heh-heh-heh. Scranton. Dunder Mifflin. Funny words are funny. Oh, my God. Rush Limbaugh was right all along. Conservative Republicanism is the answer. Good. Good for Brian. Brian, look at this. Now, this is a tasteful nude. It's called ""A Saucy Outing in Tottenham Court Square."" Brian, are you reading the new Rush Limbaugh book? I picked it up at the mall. I can't believe I'm saying this but this might be the best book I've ever read. - Brian, you gotta be joking. - No, I mean it, Lois. I've never read any of Limbaugh's stuff, but this book makes an excellent case for personal accountability, fiscal responsibility, and steak eatership. But you're a hard-core Liberal. Rush Limbaugh is a right-wing extremist. - He stands for everything you despise. - My loyalty is to reason, Lois. As a reasonable person, I reserve the right to change my mind when presented with information that alters my perspective. I gotta tell you, I had this guy all wrong. I mean, some of the stuff in here is Hey, bologna. Thank you, friends. It's always a pleasure to meet regular, real Americans. - Love the Hummer. How do you like it? - It is the best. I'm not saying you have to be gay to drive something else. But if you drive something else, you're probably a guy who likes to pleasure other men sexually. Hey, it's my new friend, Brian. Hi, Rush. Listen, I have to tell you, I read your book and it was very persuasive. I knew you'd like it and I'm glad you enjoyed it. Oh, I more than enjoyed it. Every page just spoke to me. And, you know, talking to you now, I just I wanna find the right words to describe how much I agree with you. I got the words: Thank you for doing my thinking for me. Because I lack the ability to think critically and independently. - Yes, that. - You should be proud of yourself. - You sound like a thoughtful American. - I'd love to pick your brain some more and hear your other thoughts about this country. I can do even better than that, Brian. Wow. Never thought I'd set foot inside Republican National Headquarters. - This is amazing. - And it gets better, Brian. I'm gonna introduce you to some of my pals here. Brian, meet George W. Bush. Hey, Georgie. Uncle Rush. Hey, whoo, you are getting heavy. I know. I'm 64 and three-quarters. You sure are, slugger. Hey, you got one for me? - What? What are you talking about? - Oh, come on, Uncle Rush. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Come on. Oh. Wait a second. Yay! Yippee! Thanks, Uncle Rush. Don't tell my dad. Rush, you're not giving him sweets, are you? - Goddamn it. - What's the harm? He's gonna be pooping all over his sheets and I'm gonna have to deal with it. - Hey, there, Rush. How you doing? Hey, John. Hey, I'd like you to meet my friend, Brian. Brian, John McCain. Gosh, it sure is a pleasure, Mr. McCain. - How do you two know each other? - Rush and I used to solve mysteries back in the day. I don't understand, John. The groundskeeper said he saw the mummy burning the flag. - But mummies don't hate America. - They sure don't, Rush. But Democrats do. Uh-oh! Democrats! Oh, it's okay, Hot Dog. But I think it's time we unravel the mummy and the mystery. I don't get it, John. How's a pig gonna help us lure the mummy? Rush, I've never known a Democrat to pass up pork. Gotcha. Now let's find out who you really are. It's old man Barney Frank. I would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you Republicans. Thanks for all your help, Globetrotters. That was a cold swish. Put her there. No, no, no. Look, Brian, all I'm saying is, it's not normal for people to change their political views so radically overnight. Lois, no offense, but you don't know what you're talking about. You're not exactly a fountain of political knowledge yourself. - Wanna know what I think is happening? - This should be rich and overtaxed. I think you just gotta be in the out group. Whoever's on top, whoever's in power, whoever's successful you gotta be on the other side or you don't feel like the smartest guy. All you are, my dear, is a contrarian. Oh, please, you could not be more off base. Oh, yeah? What did you think of the movie Titanic? - Horrible. One of the worst movies. - How about Slumdog Millionaire? - Overrated. Just a terrible movie. - Cocktail? Actually, not a bad film. You know, as classically structured cinema Cocktail's one of the best of its era. - You make me sick, Brian. If I were you, I'd stow that attitude because Rush Limbaugh is coming over for dinner tonight. Lois, this dinner looks delicious. Oh, well, thank you. Dig in, everyone. Hang on, I think you're forgetting the grace, Lois. Dear God, who definitely exists we, your people, who have been on this planet for 6000 years and not a second more, thank you for this bounty and for keeping Congress predominantly white, amen. So, Rush, I see you made it here okay. Driving on roads built with public funds by the government. Yeah, what about that, Rush? I guess the government's pretty good. Actually, I took the toll roads. Privately built. Way smoother than the crumbling public road system. Yeah, government sucks at doing stuff. Oh, no, toll roads sound great. Too bad only the very rich can afford to use them. - I agree with Lois. - Maybe more people could if government wasn't taxing the bejesus out of them. Now I agree with Rush. I'm too stupid to make up my own mind. Yeah, okay. Whatever you say, Rush. Hey, Rush, who'd win in a fight between you and Oprah? You know, it was a draw. We destroyed most of downtown Tokyo and then she walked sadly back into the sea. So nice weather today. Yeah, unseasonably cool. I guess we can forget that whole global warming myth. Global warming is not a myth, you son of a bitch. - What the hell are you so hostile for? - Because you brainwashed our dog. Hey, listen, sister, I just - I'm sorry. - Look, all I did was expose Brian to a different way of thinking. He I'm gonna move over here. - He embraced it on his own, Lois. - Well, after Rush opened my eyes. I am seeing the world in a whole new way now. To quote a famous troublemaker, ""I have a dream"" I dream of Republicantown Where men to the right of the aisle Don't back down The streets are aglow With the smell of apple pies And babies come out of the womb In coats and ties - Nice place, huh, Rush? - It's a paradise, Brian. Trees grow from Republican sod And everyone prays To a proper right-wing God - Republican Catholics? - Yes, indeed there are - Republican Muslims? - Well, let's not go too far - No Muslims? - No, too many tall buildings. They've outlawed all abortions Late or early It's a sin we can't abide What if you find a fetus Left abandoned We just take it And we jam it back inside Oh, yes 'Cause I dream of Republicantown The place where the happiest smile Is Cheney's frown I'll bet you a buck You won't find a damn thing wrong 'Cause when you come down to it This is where we all belong - Who else lives here? - Oh, big names, Lois. We're watching Republican stars Like sweet Mickey Rourke And his gorgeous right-wing scars - Chuck Norris is one - And he's got a right-wing beard - Jon Voight is another - He's just right-wing weird His His daughter's pretty hot, though. At one time, Brian, at one time. But how about global warming It's a snow job By Obama and his crew But aren't all his findings Backed by science? Careful, Lois - Now you're sounding like a Jew - Oy! We dream of Republicantown Where Clinton is viewed As a crazy commie clown A place where America's Growing free and strong Because when you come down to it This is where We all belong Well, I got to tell you, I'm not buying any of this crap. Rush, we want our dog back. Hang on. What are you saying? I don't have a mind of my own? Insulting. And you know what? I don't like the way you've been talking to Rush. I thought you were my friends. But if you can't accept me now that we disagree about things then maybe you aren't the friends I thought you were. I'm moving out. - What? - Again? I'm gonna go stay with Rush Limbaugh. Right, Rush? - Huh? - I'm gonna stay with you. Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. That's fine. Oh, this is a bad idea. But I guess sometimes Fox has bad ideas, huh? Let's all just sit here for a moment and remember that this was a thing. Morning, Rush. Thanks again for letting me stay here. Oh, it's not really any trouble, Brian. What do you figure, just a few days? Oh, man, who knows? It's just so good to be out of there. I've been reading all your books and I so 100 percent agree with you. What is going on with this country? I mean, wake up, America. I mean, these taxes, right? I mean, am I right about the taxes, you know? Yeah, taxes are pretty high. Is that a new coffee machine? I took the liberty of replacing your old one with a new American-made coffee machine. In fact, I got you a bunch of new top-notch, American-made stuff. What else did you buy? Oh, a couple things. That light fixture. New heat regulator on your stove. Your man bra. Your garbage disposal. Your dishwasher. And your new cat. You're listening to The Rush Limbaugh Show. Wanna take a moment to give a shoutout to my good friend, Ken Lay faked his own death, listening in on a ham radio somewhere in international waters. Smooth sailing, Kenny Boy. Hey, Rush, is it okay to hang out in here? Wha? All right, fine. Just don't say anything, okay? So, friends, we were talking about Nancy Pelosi. How do we stop her? How do we stop the Pelosi agenda? I'll tell you how. Strap her to a board put a cloth in her mouth and pour water over it. Yeah, small government. And why don't we take a short break here. Folks, we'll be right back. Brian, are you nuts? - What kind of show you think I'm doing? - What? Come on, Pelosi's a monster. She's addicted to crack. - Come on, you're with me on this. - Of course, but you can't just say that. You gotta lead people there with an argument so they arrive at it. - Man, we gotta tell people how it is. - Gotta get them on board. - Brian, there is no victory unless people know why they're wrong to disagree in the first place. Boy, do you sound soft. - What the hell's your problem? - My problem? Right now, my problem seems to be that I am talking to a Pelosi lover. - What? - Yeah, that's right. You love Pelosi. You know what? It's time for you to go. Right now. Fine. I don't have to waste my time with a softie. You call yourself a Republican? Republicans don't shy away from a fight. And I'm gonna prove it to you. A- ha! - Who are you? How did you get in here? - Shut up, Pelosi. - Are you here to take my baby? - I'm here to strap you to a board put a cloth in your mouth and pour water over it to simulate drowning. Yeah, traditional values. Griffin, you've been bailed out. Oh, Rush, thank God. Boy, you got down here quick. Yeah, I keep Strom Thurmond's corpse in the front seat so I can use a carpool lane. - Oh. Okay, well, come on, let's go home. - Great idea. Time for you to go home. Home to the Griffins. What? What do you mean? That's where you belong, Brian. You're not a conservative. That's not true. I am conservative. I support the death penalty to show people killing is wrong. That's great, Brian. Look, I make a living persuading others to join my side. But I'd never ever want somebody to be something they're not. You're a liberal, Brian. I mean, what about that 4-year-old that was executed in Texas? There was a 4-year-old executed in Texas? Not really. But you see, Brian, your concern betrays you. I know your type. It's not coincidence you turned your back on your principles when Democrats became the political establishment. You want something to fight against. I mean, I suppose we shouldn't be executing children. You see? You're not really one of us. Oh, my God. Lois was right. Right there. The fact you would give a woman credit for anything it means you're a liberal, Brian. It's time for you to spread your two left wings and fly. Does this? Does this mean I'll never see you again? Oh, I'll be around. Wherever there's a rich white guy in need of another tax break, I'll be there. Wherever there's a brain-dead woman in need of expensive life support her husband doesn't want, I'll be there. Wherever there's a country to be invaded for reasons that don't exactly pan out, I'll be there too. Oh, yes, I will be around. Hey, Limbaugh. I think you're a boneheaded, fascist, corporate-shilling blowhard. Look, you little smart-ass, I think you are a godless, socialist, pot-smoking maggot-infested member of the blame-America-first crowd. And I think you want the terrorists to win."

                    			It seems today that all you see Is violence in movies and sex on TV But where are those Good old-fasioned values On which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy Lucky there's a man who Positively can do All the things that make us Laugh and cry He's a family guy Oh, Lois, I'm so glad you were able to make it to dinner tonight. Oh, me too, Mom. We haven't seen you in ages. Oh, there you are. Did you find the new bathroom okay? Uh-huh. I'm so sorry about your father keeping us. He's probably down at the dock tinkering with that darn yacht of his. That's okay, Mom. We'll have to entertain ourselves Hey, Babs, settle something for us. I wanted to bring, um, an owl on this trip but Lois wouldn't let me. Could you have accommodated an owl? Well, I suppose there's some room in the owlery, but I can't be certain. I'll take that as a yes. You owe Dr. Hoo an apology. Change the channel? I'm tired of watching Old Ships. Peter, that's not a TV, it's a painting. Actually, Lois, it is a TV. It's the PBS show Old Ships. Good, I hate PBS. This PBS program is brought to you by generous grants from the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations and John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Additional funding by Archer Midland, Whiteman, Colgate-Palmolive, Exxon Mobil and a 20 I found in a blazer I wore to a wedding. Tonight on Ken Burns' nine-part series on street signs: ""Part Four: Yield."" Before they had the sign, people just run into each other. Maybe you had to see the first three to get this, but I am completely lost. Lois, you said there would be other men my age here. There aren't. I'm bored. Look, Peter, why don't you grab a book off a shelf and be quiet? No. Books are jerks. Stop acting like a brat. What about a picture book? Only if it has a mirror at the end of it and it says, ""How about you?"" Oh, wow, look at these old photos of you and Dad. This must be around the time you guys were first dating, huh? Oh, dear, yes. Your father was so handsome back then. I remember the day we met. It was one of those lovely, warm summer days by the shore. Perfect giant beach ball weather. Would you like another John Barrymore and soda? Ah, yes, thank you, Clarence. How are things in Terriblehood? - Terrible, sir. - Good, good. Aah! You dumb bitch! My friend and I held our breath wondering which one of us he was talking to. But the lucky one was me. And from there, our romance blossomed. Boy, you can take a punch. But at the same time, you cowered a little bit. Now, that's a woman. I love you, Pussycup. I love you too. Now let's kiss while the camera pans over to the drapes. Good stuff happening over here. All implied. It was the happiest time of our lives. Unfortunately, that was the year the Great War with Alaska broke out. And even Carter's lofty connections couldn't save him from the draft. In one of the bloodiest battles of the war, Carter nearly lost his life in the battle with the infamous, walrus-backed Nanookwaffe. But through all of it, Carter never forgot to write to me daily to send his love along with a mixtape. Wanna spend a mind-blowing afternoon? Get stoned and listen to this song. Jeepers Creepers Where'd you get those peepers? But after some months, the letters stopped coming. And I was certain he had perished. So I took up with a young dandy named Rodginald. He would bring me small chocolates and sit in my front parlor and pitch woo at me taking my hand gently, and singing from bended knee the popular songs of his youth. Marry me And I will buy you chewing gum And a hat that has a giant plume And if someday You're feeling rather saucy You can put the chewing gum In the hat With no other suitors to speak of I agreed that I would marry him forthwith. Even though my heart still belonged to Carter. I believe Rodginald knew this. And he even tried to strike me in the manner to which I had become accustomed. But it wasn't the same. And then a miracle happened. Babs. Carter. Oh, Carter, you're alive. I've missed you so. Babs, be my wife. Oh, yes. Carter, yes. Hey, that's my gal. Dear sir, I respectfully urge you to prepare yourself for one devil of a skirmish. Oh, I always love hearing that story, Mom. I got a story about a fat guy who's starving and bored. Peter, if you're that hungry, go down to the dock and find Daddy. - We'll get dinner started. - You're not gonna get dinner. She's gonna tell that sloppy Spanish maid to do it. She will, only because she needs money to pay for medicine for her prematurely overweight son, Diabeto. Mama, may I have cookie? No, Diabeto, roll back to kitchen. Mr. Pewterschmidt! Mr. Pewterschmidt, dinner's ready! Damn it, he can't hear me. Ah, that was excellent. When I clenched it, you took your fingers away. - You were right to do that. - Oh, my God. Mr. Pewterschmidt, you're having an affair? Ew! - No, no, this is my sister. - Ew! - No, no, no, I'm impotent. - Ew! - She looked at me while I did it to myself. - Ew! - I mean, she's a man. - Ew! We need more E's and W's down here now. Just turn the M's upside down, and send them down here. I don't care. I'll take the heat. Just turn them over and send them down. Mr. Pewterschmidt, you're having an affair? Why don't you say it louder, idiot? I thought sailors only slept with little buoys. Knock it off. Now, look, Peter, l Shut up. Now, Peter, you can't Damn it. Oh, shut up. Look what you did, you jackass. - What? I didn't mean to - Stop it. - It liked my joke. - It won't shut up. Yes, give me the owlery, please. Release the owls. Griffin, you better not breathe a word about what you saw here. But how can you be having an affair? What about Babs? That's not your concern. You didn't see anything. Remember that, or I'll ruin you. Okay, I promise. I'll be as quiet as a church mouse. Billy, I was gonna have a party at the rectory this evening. Do you like sacramental wine and mouse Russell Crowe movies? Oh, boy, do I? Hey, can my sister come? No, she'd ruin it. Now, you keep your mouth shut about what you saw. Yes, sir, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Oh, there you are, boys. Sorry, sweetheart, I lost track of time. Right, Peter? I'm Peter. Well, let's eat, huh? You must be starving, Peter. What, am I on trial here? Uh, maybe you should just eat something, Peter. Go, put some food in your mouth. Yes, sir, I sure will, Mr. Cooterschmidt Pewterschmidt. Oh, God. Peter, are you feeling all right? Oh, he's fine. You know how hungry a man gets after a day at sea. - He eats with porpoise. - Ha-ha Oh! For God's sake, you're always an embarrassment at the table. Should've seen when we had dinner with Paul McCartney's ex-wife. He kept playing footsie with her under the table. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Hey, guys? I got a problem. Um, you know how Lois has that dad? - Yeah. - Well, we were there the other night. And I caught him cheating with some bimbo. - Oh, my God. - You're kidding. Anyway, he told me not to tell, but I'm having a real hard time not telling Lois. How could you not? Peter, once entered into, marriage is a sacred bond. An alliance blessed by God, and hallowed by the community. I'll never opt for the matrimonial condition. It wouldn't be fair to the framework of the institution. But for those who do and then turn their back on its convictions? Shame. This is unwelcome news, Peter. Very unwelcome. I know, but I don't know what to do. It's really hard keeping my mouth shut. Actually, Peter, this could be an opportunity for you. - What do you mean? - Lois' dad is loaded. Get him to pay through the nose to keep your mouth shut. Yeah, you could really milk this thing, Peter. - Huh. I never thought of it like that. - Wait a minute. You're not serious. That's unethical. Brian, no one cares. You can make him your slave. Oh, man. He'd hate that even more than he hates sitcom two-parters. Tootie, it's 8:29. Now either try that beer or dump it down the sink. Wait, now I have to wait a whole week to find out if she gave in to peer pressure at that party. Carter. Carter, wake up. It's okay, Lois. Daddy's just taking your temperature. What? What is it? I heard a noise downstairs. I'll go have a look. - It's probably just the wind. - The wind, dear. Is that how you say that? I've only seen that word written. Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Griffin. What are you doing in my house? I was getting ready to watch a movie on your TV but first I thought I'd use your toilet. - That's not a toilet. - Hey, when's it go down? - It's just doing a lot of loop-de-Ioops. - Get out of there. Oh, no, no. No, you don't get to talk to me like that anymore. Not unless you want me to blab about what happened. What are you getting at, Griffin? That's right, you're gonna start doing a lot for me. - Like what? - For starters, got more than one limo? - Yeah. - You and me are gonna do a limo joust. What the hell is that? All right, you ready? - I don't wanna do this. - Go. That went exactly as I wanted it to go. Here's your Mike and Ikes, with all the Ikes taken out. I hope you were careful because if I find one Ike there, I'm going straight to Babs. It's fine, I double-checked. Here's your Mikes. Next? I want you to fly to France and tell French people that a good-Iooking, depressed guy smoking a cigarette is not a movie. People of France a good-Iooking, depressed guy smoking a cigarette is not a movie. And your sirens sound like gay guys having a threesome. You got my catch phrases for me? I just want you to know this was a huge pain in the ass. ""Peter's new catch phrases by Carter Pewterschmidt."" All business. I like that. I've been under the weather, so it may not be my best work. ""Shape up or show me your balls."" Heh. That's good. Really? How about this one? ""In your face, Nancy Grace."" I love it. Oh, man, there are a lot of good ones here. ""Fire alarm? I am the fire alarm."" Find your own beach house, Crabby. Put that in your office and frame it."" Last one's kind of lame. - Did you get to one at the bottom? - Which? - ""On your mark, get set, terrible."" - No, this one here. ""If you got a problem, take it up with my butt. He's the only one that gives a crap."" - Oh, my God, that's it. - Yeah. - That's the one. You are - I thought you'd like Oh, well Take it up with my butt because he's the only one who gives a crap. You know, Lois, I've noticed Peter and Carter spending a lot of time together lately. It's nice to see them finally getting on. I know. Who would have thought, huh? Boy, I can't wait to get this home. I keep not laughing at The Big Bang Theory and I figure it's gotta be the television. TV this size, forget it. It'll have me laughing till I got snots falling out. Where are you taking our television? I'm giving it to Peter. What? Why? - Yeah, why, Carter? - Ugh. Because Peter is the best, and he is awesome and he makes better laser sounds than I do. Right. You hear that, Lois? And he's not just saying that because I covered for him about his affair. - What? - Carter. Is this true? Yes. It's true. Oh, dear. Well, on your mark, get set, terrible. Ha-ha-ha. No, but I understand that this is bad. You stupid fat bastard. How could you tell her? We had a deal. You're blowing this out of proportion, Carter. - She's divorcing me. - Well, I don't blame her. Daddy, how could you do this to Mom? You two were perfect together. It was such a close marriage. Maybe the two of you splitting up is a blessing in disguise. I mean, there were some problems in your relationship. Who knows, maybe some time apart could be what you need. Think of the fun stuff you can do as a single guy. Like going to loud awful bars and not being able to hear the chick next to you say something stupid. It's gonna be awesome. I don't know how to do that. Easy. I'll help you meet women, Mr. Pewterschmidt. Come on, it's been 50 years since I've been on a date. How'd you get that chick, then? You know in that movie Liam Neeson gets his daughter back? Yeah. That was one girl their dad didn't get back. - What is this? Where's the cigarette girl? - They don't have those anymore. Peter, I don't know about this. I haven't even had normal sexual relations in a long time. With Babs, I finish in my hand, and just throw it at her. Look, relax, will you? Got these off a website that tells you things to say when hot women walk by. Ooh. Here comes a hot one. Say the first thing on the list. ""I love getting trendy cupcakes in the middle of the day for no reason."" No way. So do I. - Hi, I'm Paula. - Carter. How do you do? Why don't you and your friend come join us at our table? Peter Griffin. How do you do? We would We would love to. Hey, girls, these are my two new friends. Hello, ladies. My name is Carter, and I require a tremendous amount of calcium. Carter, come here. Sit next to me. Oh, this is fun. We're having fun. What do you say we get some drinks? Hey, boy, boy. Fetch me a John Barrymore and soda, and three Myrna Loys for the women. Excuse me? - What the hell is your problem, you jerk? - What? Does he belong to somebody else? Come on, girls, let's ditch this racist dick. What happened? Did we get laid? You jackass. Those women were coming on to you and you blew it. We gotta go to another club and start all over again. Peter, I don't wanna go to another club. I don't want women like that. I want Babs. Babs? You got a room full of chicks like that and you're thinking about Babs? She looks like someone farted in a shoe. I had a moment of weakness, but I know now that I was wrong. I need her, Peter. I love her. You got to help me get her back. It's probably the right move anyway. Those girls seemed annoying. Look at them, taking a group picture together. - I love you. - I love you. We're all such good friends. You can tell by the way we're pressing our faces together. And that's where fat girls come from. Carter, if there's one thing girls like, it's a guy with tattoos. When Babs sees this one, she's gonna take you back. Nice. What's the tattoo? Oh, it's great. It's a donkey's vagina. What? How is that gonna? Peter, stop him! No, this is good. This means I did a good job. If I've learned anything from romantic comedies it's that the ex-wife falls for her husband again after he befriends a little kid. - Okay. And the kid needs to be really cute. So I ordered Jonathan Lipnicki. Ah, there's the cute little guy now. Hang on. Oh, my God. What happened to you? Oh, we gotta get you to the hospital. Aah! Aah! You're hideous. Who did this to you? Oh! Oh! Where are my keys? Where's my keys? Where are my keys? - Peter, what about Babs? - Forget about yourself for a second. Look what has happened to Jonathan Lipnicki. Oh, yeah. No, you're right. You should probably take care of that. I'll be I'll be here. Carter, I think this will definitely work. As soon as she sees you, you've got to do exactly what l Hey, whose Duesenberg is that parked in the driveway? There's only one man I know who drives a Duesenberg. And I will buy you laudanum And rhubarb cakes To balance out Your fragile body's humors Oh, Babs, I don't wish to overwhelm you with my passions but I must say this: I'm ever so content. Oh, I am too, Rodginald. Do you think perhaps one day, if we should marry, that I could sit beside you? Yes, I think that would be fine. Get away from my wife, you rascal. Oh, such language in the presence of a lady. If it's a row you want, I will cleave you in 'twixt. Hang on. I think I know how to take this guy down. Penis. Carter, get out of here this instant. I don't ever want to see you again. Pussycup, please. Mrs. Pewterschmidt, Carter has something important to say to you. I'll set the mood.

Babs, I need you. Cheating on you was the worst mistake of my life. I kneel before you a frightened soul and a broken man. A man who has nothing without you. Give me one more chance, and I pledge to place above you nothing. Not even myself. For all my time here, and for time forever. Please, I beg you. Carter, what you did was unforgivable. And as beautiful as your words are I just don't know that they can fix what's done. I know I can't do it overnight but we can still have a lot of years together. Please. Just let me try. Carter, you had sex with that woman. So, no, I can't trust you. But at my age, I'm certainly not going to remarry either. So if you'd like to move back in and take things slowly, one step at a time I suppose I can give you the chance to earn my trust again. - Sounds like a lot of work. Go to hell. What are we here for? What are we here for? All right, fine, fine. I'm gonna try. Come here, you. Hey, look, I found a genie's lamp. Oh, no? Okay, maybe next week."

Opening day, and here's the first pitch. And the season 's over. You were a good sport this year, Quagmire. Well, you know, Peter, it's all in good fun, right? You know, my grandfather used to have a saying Holy crap, you speak Ebonics? No, no, Peter, it's Japanese. Wait, are they the angry eye ones or the tired eye ones? I'm not sure I The first one, I guess. I I don't know. My grandfather on my mom's side was Japanese. Wait a minute, you're You're part Japanese? Sure am. My grandfather was a pilot for the Imperial Air Force during World War II. FIew a kamikaze mission in the Battle of Midway. He's part ofthe reason I became a pilot. Wow. How come I never met him? He was a kamikaze pilot. Y eah, no, I heard you, he was a Karma Chameleon, but how come I never met him? Because he died, Peter. Oh, my God, when? And how? Hey, Joe, what are you doing? I thought we were gonna go to The CIam and get wasted. Ugh. I can't. I'm on duty tonight. And Halloween's got to be the worst night of the year to be a cop. AII you do is drive around, confiscate beer from teenagers and occasionally handcuff a drunk woman in a sexy costume. Oh, cool! Hey, I got a great idea. How about we ride around with you and steal beer from teenagers? I don't know, you guys. This is my job, and I can't have you fooling around, getting into trouble. Hey, when the hell do I get into trouble? Well, didn't you get Iost in the grocery store Iast week? -Are you okay? -No! I came in with my wife and now I can't find her! I'm sure she's here somewhere.

Our first high school Halloween party. Do you think we'II get to make out? These things always end up in make-out sessions. Hey, you know what, you guys? My cousin went to a Halloween party and made out with a guy, and she's hideous. I mean, really hideous. Like Egon Schiele's expressionistic period. Well, what did you expect? He was a protégé of Gustav KIimt. Yes, but KIimt was more focused on symbolism and heightened emotion whereas Schiele was purposely vulgar -in order to de-mystify the human form. -Good point. Am I the only one who wants to wet some knuckle tonight? Yeah. How'd your cousin do it? She wore a mask. Don't you get it? If we wear our masks and we don't take them off for the whole party, the boys won't know who we are, and we'II have a better chance of hooking up. -Good idea! -We are so gonna hook up! -I think we Iook hot. -Totally hot. Ugly bitches! So, what's the story, Quagmire? Do you observe any particular Japanese customs? Oh, yeah, I'm very in touch with my Asian roots. You notice I take my shoes off whenever I enter my house. Oh, yeah. I do five hours of math homework every night even though I'm no Ionger in school. Sometimes I drink out of a wooden box. Ah, very Asian. I was a very cute baby and now I'm a joyless adult. They are unhappy. All units, we've got a domestic disturbance at Fifth and Maple. This is Officer Swanson responding, I'm on my way. AII right, you guys, these domestic dispute situations can get pretty dicey, so I need you to stay in the car, okay? No joking around. AII right, sir, sir, ma'am. I just need you to tell me clearly and calmly what happened. One at a time, please. -The whore gets her stubby fingers -He puts cigars in his mouth -in my wallet! Larceny! -and he becomes a different person! No freakin' way. Guys, I told you to wait in the car. Domestic abuse is a very delicate matter. Joe, this isn't domestic abuse, this is hilarious. And another thing I'm tired of massaging your foot knuckles! You call that a massage, with your baby carrot fingers? -Go to hell! -Come here! Get over here! Stay away from me! You keep him away from me! Why, you Iittle Get over here! -I'm gonna jump over you and I'm gonna -Come back here! AII right, that's enough, you two. This is serious. Stop it. Quick, Quagmire, give me your iPod. I swear to God! You keep him away from me! Got 'em. Aw, they got tuckered out. Of course they did, they ran, Iike, two miles for them. Okay, there they are, Brian. And they've still got my candy. You distract them, and I'II run up from behind and grab it. Stewie, don't be ridiculous. They're kids, and I'm an adult. I'II just go over there and calmly ask them to give back the candy. Hi, fellas. Hey, Iook, it's Snoopy. Hey, Snoopy, where's Woodstock? Ah, that's That's a good one. Listen, my friend, Stewie, he's just a baby, and you guys took his candy earlier. What do you say you just give it back, and we all forget this ever happened? Sure, why not? Your friend's candy is right around the corner. AII right. Terrific. Hey, hey, what are you doing? Stop it! Hey, Iet me go! No! No! Oh, my God, you Iook so cute. What is that, spray paint? Yeah.

No, I was only half serious. We can't do that. Oh, my God Pink Brian is crazy Brian. Oh, man. I know, I know we can't. I just feel bad they stole your candy. Well, now I know how Peter feels when Mort steals his paper. Come on, that's right, you bastard. Stop right there! Give me the paper! No! No! Don't hurt me, you bastard. Mort, give me the paper. No, I'm reading it in here. You can have the real estate section. It's for schmucks, anyway. Okay, your turn to spin the bottle, guy dressed Iike Bill CIinton. Yeah, dressed Iike.

It's good to finally be off duty. Wow, I never knew about this place, Quagmire. Yeah, this is the Air Force graveyard, where old military planes come to die. That one over there is my favorite. It's an old Japanese Zero. Wow, no calories and all that Japanese taste? That's the kind of plane my grandfather used to fly -in the war. -Cool. Man, this thing Iooks Iike it still might be in working order. You guys want to go for a ride? -Sure. -Hell, yeah. Wow, I always thought the Japanese flew flying saucers. AII right, there they are.

Now, Iisten very closely 'cause here's how it's gonna go down. Guys, guys, guys, I don't want to toot my own horn here, but I think that was me. Well, there's only one thing to do now. Go to plan B. Mom! I am so sorry, Mrs. Griffin. I have no idea what got into my son. Well, just have him return the candy and everything's fine. Justin, you give this young man his candy back right now. AII right. Here. Thanks. Now we want Justin's candy. -What? -You heard me. Take Justin's bag of candy and pour it into Stewie's. AII of it. And if I think you're holding back on me, we're gonna have a serious problem. Well, all right. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, serious problem. Good.

Well, I got to say, she's a natural. You know, she could make some serious money as a professional. Wow, you really think so? Oh, sure. Women's boxing is a rapidly growing part of the field. You should consider your wife competing for a belt. Well, she did Iook Iike she knew what she was doing up there. Think about it. Here's my card. What can I say? I really Iike watching her box. That means two things. Hey, Lois, congrats on winning that boxing match Iast night. I saw your picture in The Daily Growl. Brian, The Daily Growlis not a real paper. What? Y eah, it is. I Iike that sound. Mom, since when are you a boxer? I'm not, honey. Honestly, I don't know what came over me Iast night. It was just one of those crazy things that sort of happened after a few drinks. Morning, everyone! Morning, champ! You feeling Ioose, today? Peter, what are you doing? What is all this? I'm a fight promoter now. And I got you another fight. You're boxing tonight at the Quahog Civic Center. Are you out of your mind? No, Peter. That was a one-time thing, all right? I am not a boxer, and I'm not fighting anyone else. And that's final. AII right, well, how about this, then? I'II take you somewhere real fancy and romantic for dinner, just the two of us. And in return, I get to try and convince you to fight. Well, going out for dinner would be nice. But I'm not changing my mind. Oh, gosh, I can't wait to see this fancy restaurant. Oh, you're gonna Iove it, Lois. Here, put on these special eating gloves I bought you. Why do I need to wear gloves to eat in a fancy restaurant? Because it's so fancy that You know what? I'm tired of this. I booked you a boxing match. Son of a bitch! Damn it, Peter. I told you, I don't want to be a boxer! Who the hell do you think you are? There you go! Use that anger! Hey, remember when I said I think it's hot when you wear a sports bra and gym shorts underneath your dress? -Yeah? -Now, put these shoes on. Stop it, you jackass! I told you, I'm not fighting! I'm sorry, there's been a terrible mistake. My idiot husband here booked this match without my knowledge She's from the Ukraine, Lois! She doesn't speak English! AII right. She's from the other part of the Ukraine! It's a different dialect! One, two, three. Hey! What you doing down there, Lois? What's the matter? Mad at Iittle old me? In your imagination, I've got Iong eyelashes. One! Two! Three! Did you know where the Ukraine was because of my globe? No, I saw it in a book. You knew 'cause of my globe, you dick. Eight! Nine! Ten! We have a winner! Well, what do you think of that, Lois? You still mad at me now? Peter! I feel great! I've never felt so in control. I know the feeling. It's how I feel when I burp really Ioud in an underground parking structure to assert my dominance. Says the king. AII right, kids, I'm off to train at the gym. Jeez, Lois, you're really taking this seriously, huh? Well, yeah, Brian, why wouldn't I? I don't know, you've just never really been the aggressive type. I mean, you're usually so measured and collected. I know, Brian, but when I stepped into that ring, I don't know, something happened to me. It's Iike I tapped into this primal wellspring of pent-up anger that just needed to be released. Really? What do you have to be angry about? -Where are my flapjacks? -Huh? You will recall, Iast night, ere I drifted off into slumber with a nudie magazine betwixt my Iegs, I spake thusly, ""Lois, tomorrow morning, I want flapjacks."" It was a simple message, yet it has gone unheeded. AII right, Peter, give me a minute. For every five seconds I do not have flapjacks, I shall break one window. Uh-huh. Look, Lois, it just seems to me that this isn't necessarily the healthiest thing for a woman your age to be doing. Brian, I'm 42, I'm in the prime of my Iife, and this is what I want right now. You're sure about that? Meg, go make your father some flapjacks. Okay, Mom. This is crazy! Is nobody really making me flapjacks yet? At this point, you guys are being as irresponsible as I am! Gonna fly now Flying high now Gonna fly Fly Fly Well, it's broken, all right. Well, you got to fix her, Doc. There's a big fight coming up. She's got to defend her title. Look, Peter, I don't think there's gonna be any fight. What are you talking about? Look at me. I got a broken nose. I think this is a sign that maybe it's time to hang up the gloves. What are you, out of your mind? Don't you give me that attitude, Peter. Look, Lois, we're making a Iot of cash with this boxing thing. And I need money for bourbon and anime. Well, I just can't understand any of this. Everybody in Japan is either a 10-year-old girl or a monster. I don't care about the money, Peter! I don't care about boxing! The only reason I did this in the first place -was 'cause of you! -What do you mean? Peter, sometimes you're so insensitive, and you make me so angry, I just want to clock you in the jaw. Obviously, I can't do that, so boxing was an outlet. Wait, you mean the reason you fight so good is Yeah, 'cause I'm making believe I'm fighting you! Wow. Am I that much of a bastard? Sometimes, yes. Jeez, Lois, I'm sorry. I mean, I don't mean to be, I just Look, if you don't want to fight anymore, you don't have to. Well, good. And the truth is, I suppose I kind of got most of it out of my system anyway. I Iove you, Lois. I Iove you, too, Peter. Is it cool if I tell your insurance that I gave you heart surgery? Ladies and gentlemen, in honor ofher retirement after 17 consecutive victories, I hereby dedicate this statue to Quahog's greatest fighter, Lois Griffin! I'm also having a celebratory keg party back at my house later. You can tell your parents that my parents will be there. But they won 't be. And now a few words from Lois Griffin herself. Thank you so much for coming, everyone, and thank you for always cheering me on at all my fights. Hey, Griffin! -Oh, my God, that's Deirdre Jackson! -Who's that? Only the deadliest fighter in all of women's boxing. She's killed three people in the ring. Her fists are so dangerous, she's not allowed to be a Iesbian. I know why you're retiring, Griffin! You're scared! Scared? Of what? Of me! Look at these people, giving you a statue for fighting a bunch of bums! If you're so great, why don't you prove it? Fight me! Look, I don't need to prove anything. I'm retired, and that's the way it's gonna stay. Oh, yeah? Hey, man, you want a real woman? Why don't you bring your pretty Iittle self over to my apartment tonight, and I'II show you a real woman? I'm ashamed! Hey, that's my husband you're talking to! Yeah?

We 've got exclusive coverage of tonight's women 's boxing bout, Griffin versus Jackson. We 're here live with contender Deirdre Jackson outside her dressing room. Deirdre, is it true you've killed three women in the ring? Tonight it's gonna be four. Are you saying you intend to kill your opponent? Let's just say you don 't want to miss round six. Lois, you can't go out there! -What? Why not? -Because if you step into that ring, she's gonna kill you. No, she's not, Peter. What the hell kind of talk is that? Now, I'm gonna win this thing. Look, Lois, you don't have to do this for me. I know I make you mad sometimes, but I thought we agreed you'd hang up the gloves. I'II hang up the gloves after I knock her ass out. Peter, she milked your boobs, and there were a Iot of people I knew there. Now, Iet's go. Butt scratcher! Get your butt scratcher here! Now, since this is a televised boxing match, I'm gonna be joined by a horribly disfigured former fighter providing barely intelligible commentary throughout. Any thoughts on the fight, FIoyd? I think that they're gonna have, they are gonna be fighting Deirdre's Iast fight in the contrast to the Iater one is gonna be better than usually. And how do you think that helps her chances tonight? Well, the match Iasting the bout up until the particular inaccuracy, particular unusually that should be the ultimate determining factor in about the 12-round experience, the heart of a champion margarine hat. Well, we'II be watching for that. We'II be checking in with you throughout the night, FIoyd. And happy 23rd birthday. You're welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? Introducing tonight's fighters. In this corner, weighing in at 134 pounds, the top-ranked boxer in all ofRhode lsland, Deirdre ""Action "" Jackson! I think every Italian in Quahog is here. Yeah! Go, white girl! Hey, yo, you're getting your grinder on my grinder! And in this corner, weighing in at 130 pounds, it's the Ovarian Barbarian and the Breast of All Time, Iet's put our hands together for Quahog's own Lois Griffin! Okay, here's the rules. No hitting below the belt, no rabbit punches, no name calling, no making trouble for unconventional couples who want to adopt babies, 'cause you know what? They ain't getting the good babies, anyways. Okay, have a fun fight. Ding, ding. You think you're tough? Well, Iet's see what you got! Wow, she's really hitting Mom hard. Good. How you feeling, Lois? She She's too She's too strong, Joe. I don't stand a chance out there. AII right, Lois, you Iisten to me and you Iisten good. I held your hand during childbirth, I watched you raise three kids on a shoestring budget, you never gave up then, and you're not giving up now! Because you're the toughest woman I've ever met. And if there was a hall of fame for hearts, yours would be the biggest one in the whole damn building! Peter, you're in the wrong corner! Ah. AII right, Lois, you Iisten to me and you Iisten good. Damn it! Shut up! Everybody shut up! This took a Iot of courage! Well, Iadies and gentlemen, here we are at round six, the round that Deirdre Jackson predicted she'd kill Lois Griffin. What do you think, FIoyd, is she gonna make good on that promise? A broken promise is a Iot Iike a child's pinwheel. You have to be yourself, or at Ieast within the confines. AII right, well, Iet's see what's going on in the ring. Finish this. One, two Lois, stay down. Don't get up. You've got nothing to prove. five, six You get up, you die! I've had enough of you!

And the winner is Lois Griffin! Now, if everyone couldjust pick up two chairs before you leave, we can get this place cleaned up a lot quicker. Wow. Well, what do you think, FIoyd? How did Lois Griffin do what no other challenger could do and knock out Deirdre Jackson? I have a strong headache when I go to sleep and wake up. And how do you think that's going to affect Jackson's next fight? My Puerto Rican wife got fat. Well, I got to be honest, Lois, I had my doubts, but you really held your own in that ring. Thanks, Brian. It was nice to go out a champion. Well, we're real proud of you, Lois. And thanks to Deirdre, I even got some of my own milk to put on my cereal. -Dad, come on! -Peter! For crying out Ioud! What? I'm fun. English - US - SDH"

Lois, you didn't have to go through all this fuss. What you got there? This? It's just a copy of Us magazine. Can you believe it? Wish lt. Want lt. Do lt. got three stars. How hilarious is that? It's not hilarious. It's great, Brian. That's a huge accomplishment. Well, I helped get the review in. I called a friend over at Us Weekly who usually just covers people with gross amounts of children, but now he's the book reviewer. So hats off to both of us. Well, nice going, Stewie. You ought to be my publicist. You know, I don't want you to be offering me this just because we're related. I do have references you can call. You know, I spent a month as Melanie Griffith's Ioose skin holder. -Melanie! -Melanie! Over here. You Iook beautiful. Can't hold on much Ionger. I should have stayed in bed. Yeah, we're walking in now. Make sure Tom Tucker knows he has 20 minutes and he is to only talk about the book, no personal questions, all right? Are you okay? You good? You need anything? AII right.

Now you have exactly 20 seconds to find us a room with a white sofa, a white table, white hydrangeas and Fiji water! Stewie, there's no need to Ooh! I said no gray M&M's. These are all gray. Don't worry, Brian. I've got it all under control. You're a big canine star. They should be treating you Iike Spuds MacKenzie. Man, I wonder what he's doing now. Now, Iadies, approach him slowly. He can't really see anymore. I've injected him with the Viagra. Now, I'm gonna roll him on his back, but you're pretty much gonna have to do 100% of the work. We're here with Brian Griffin, Iocal author of the new bestseller Wish lt. Want lt. Do lt. Am I pronouncing that correctly? Uh Y eah. Now, what does that mean, Wish lt. Want lt. Do lt? Well, it basically just refers to the steps necessary for identifying and achieving your dreams and doing so in as effective and expeditious a manner as possible. Wow. And it's nonfiction, right? Yes, it is. Now, which one is that? I always forget. Is that the one that really happened or not? Uh Yeah. Okay. So now So this is This is a true story. Well, it's not really a narrative Doesn't matter. I'm hooked. And we'II be right back with sports. Okay, you're doing great so far. Now I was just texting with New York. We're doing a whole thing there. I booked your plane ticket, and I specifically asked that you not sit next to an Asian. Stewie, that's racist. That's terrible. I'm sorry, do you want me to call back and change it? Well, it's done now. Seems Iike a Iot of extra work. Okay, there's a book signing at the Barnes and Noble on Union Square at 5:00. And then at 7:00 you're meeting with a reporter from In Style magazine at Pastis. I just want to warn you, she's very heavy. So be prepared for that. -Jeez, how heavy? -I don't know, but apparently heavy enough that they felt they needed to warn me. Oh, Iook at this. Your book is number three on Amazon. Number three? Well, who's number one? It's that new biography on Michael Jackson. Come on, another one? Unless it was written by a 10-year-old's rectum, who cares? It doesn't say who the author is, Brian, but I would guess that it's probably not that. Well, Stewie, I can't tell you how much I appreciate all you're doing. I mean, I have been so happy with most everything. Oh Most? Yeah, don't even It's so tiny, those other things, it's not even worth Oh, my God, you're amazing. I've been so thrilled with how you're doing. -Great. -Hi, can I help you? Yeah, checking in. Brian Griffin. You should usually do that. You should check me in. That's Iike one of the things I was talking about. I just have to tell you, I Ioved your book, Mr. Griffin. Thank you so much. You made my day. So, you still in school? Graduating this year. Well, we'II have to celebrate while I'm here. Okay, well, I'II be right back with your key. She's so pretty, isn't she? Yeah, you know. -Do you think she Iiked me? -I don't know. How weird would it be if she just showed up at my room Iater? Pretty weird, I guess. Oh, my God, were you Were you thinking of doing that? Sending her to my room? No, why? Why? Were you thinking of me doing that? I don't even know what you're saying anymore, man. Just do whatever you're thinking. Man, crazy. Hi, I just want to say that I can't tell you how much your book has helped me. Uh-huh. What's your name? It's Jan. Okay, here you go, Dan. Yeah, it's Jan. Back ofthe Iine. Go on. Come back around, he'II try it again. Hi. Can you make it out to Kelly? Well, hi there. I sure can. You know, I have to tell you, Wish lt. Want lt. Do lt. totally changed my Iife. Well, you know, that's what I set out to do with this book, so, you know, I got to tell you, that makes me feel pretty great. This is just a phone number. I know, I know, my phone number. Oh. Yeah. -What do you think of that? -Um I'm not sure. -Well, you know, I'm sure for you. -Oh. -Yeah. -I see. Yeah. I'm a Iittle creeped out. Hey, congratulations, somebody famous now hates you. Okay, so, that's enough autographs, I think. Listen, I want to thank you all for coming down. And remember, wish it, want it, buy it. AII right. Brian, settle down. You're worse than that guy from Penguin Publishing. You want to get a book published, don't you? Well, yes. Well, if you want to be in black and white, black and white's got to be in you. God, you know, Stewie, I used to think that John Lennon was kind of a jerk for saying The Beatles were bigger than Jesus, but now, I mean, it's Iike, I'm not saying I am, but I get it. You know, now that we have two minutes to kind of Iet the dust settle, I just want to say that I'm really proud of you. Hey, I'm proud of myself, man. I mean, I think it's Iike You know, I think everybody has greatness in them, but it's really about having the courage to just kind of get inside your own head and just kind of poke around in there, you know, and be Iike, ""Hey, oh, my gosh, what's under here? ""Hey, what do you call yourself?"" ""Oh! Wisdom."" ""Oh! Profundity."" ""Oh! Truth."" ""Hey, Iet's all just go hang out together between the covers of a book."" I Iove hearing about your process. Hey, enough about me. This was a great meal. Good, good, I'm glad you Iike it. They told me everybody comes here. Hey, there's Renée Zellweger. Hey, Renée, how you doing? Hey, Brian! This is my agent, Richard. Hey, good to meet you. How's Bradley? Renée dates Bradley Cooper. Really great. He's really found his niche, you know. He's really got the cheap, forgettable Iead thing down, which is great. That's fantastic, 'cause, you know, I might bankroll this comedy, and we need somebody who's not that funny and not that good Iooking, and that you forget about, the second you Ieave the theater. I think Bradley would be perfect for that! Are you sure? Because we really need somebody who constantly seems Iike they're about to be big, but keeps not actually being big. Well, he'd really want to see the script, but I mean, that's what Bradley does. I don't know, we really need somebody, who has not been the best thing in anything he's ever been in, ever. I mean the kind of guy who can get overshadowed by Zach Galifianakis or Ed Helms. Well, of course, I can't speak for Bradley, but I really think he'd want to be considered for this. Y eah, the thing is, for this roll, we need a guy who has all the characteristics that you would describe as handsome, but who is not actually handsome himself! Well, again, only Brad can speak for Brad, but this seems right for him. Yeah, I think he'd be right, too. The problem is, we'd Iike to find an actor who has been given a Iot of chances to shine, but who has never actually shined. Not one single time! Well, I think he'd be I got to get back to my dinner here, but I think he'd be perfect! And I really hope you keep Bradley Cooper in mind. AII right, well, we got to go. Hey. They seemed really nice. Get over here! Is everything okay? No, everything is not okay. Can you figure out what the problem is? I don't I honestly have no Oh, God! How do you think I feel walking out of the back room of a restaurant and seeing Renée Zellweger eating in the front room of that restaurant? I am mortified. Absolutely mortified! You should know better than this! I told them who you were when I made the reservation! Look, I have written a best-selling phenomenon! I should be sitting in the front goddamn room! Okay, okay, I hear you, I hear you. And I just want you to know that my only goal is to be able to help you better. And you being honest with me, well, that's helping me do that. So thank you. Good. Brian, are you going straight back to the hotel? 'Cause I was gonna go back You know what, I'II just I'II take a cab. Oh. Well, at Ieast it's not raining. Hey, Brian, welcome home! How was your book signing? Jeez, Lois, could I have, Iike, five minutes to decompress, please? It was a really horrible flight, and I was sitting next to a Japanese guy who had a cold. I swear, Rupert, Brian has become a monster! That trip was sheer hell. It was even worse than visiting my Russian grandma. Come here, babupka. Let me put your fingers in my mouth. I want to press my cold, Ioose face onto your warm, tight face and breathe meat into your nose. But now, I wrap you in sticky towel and Iay you in bucket of beet juice. Now I put herring in bucket with you, so you have friend. You know what? I bet my ways would seem just as foreign to you. Stewie, I got a flea thing going on in here! Where the hell's my Frontline? Oh, my God! Brian! Brian! Brian, Iook at this! I got you on Real Time with Bill Maher! You're kidding? That's awesome, Stewie! Great job! ""Great job,"" so you know that phrase. -What's that? -What? What phrase do I know? Bill Maher! Whoo! Okay, so the topic is going to be, ""Should God play a role in politics?"" Oh, and here's your heartworm pill wrapped in baloney. Stewie, the point of the baloney is that I don't know the pill is there. Why am I standing under an air vent? Um Because -Because that's where -""Because that's where"" -I -""I"" -Because -""Because"" -Well -""Well"" -I can -""I can"" -You -Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Mr. Griffin, we'II be ready in five minutes. You'II be on the panel with Arianna Huffington and Dana Gould. Wait, wait. My publicist told me Christopher Hitchens would be on the panel. No, we told him Dana and Arianna two hours ago. I did my prep research on Christopher Hitchens. -I am so sorry. -I am done with you. Do you hear me? Done! Get out of here now! -Brian, please. -You're fired! Yes, but I think the more important question that sometimes gets ignored is what about the separation of church and state? Well, Bill, see, I think Actually, Dana, if I may, if I may, I have some insight on this. Bill, do you mind? Go, dog. Well, it just so happens that separation of church and state is something I'm actually gonna cover in my next book, God. Period. Damn it. What does that mean? Well, if I can expand on this. For one thing, ""In God we trust"" is on money. Now, what does that tell you? Tells me Americans will get all Christ-y about any sort of stupid shit. So what? I think what's actually alarming is the fact that all this kind of pseudo-spirituality is being peddled to the American people in books that have, really, Iess substance than an issue of TV Guide. That's a good argument. It's a very good argument. I agree. I agree. Really? Because I read Wish lt. Want lt. Do lt. Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed! Gosh, next thing you know, both of you guys are gonna tell me that it changed your Iives. Uh Yeah, I didn't read it. Hey, so you're the guy. It's actually It's actually very popular. Well, it may be popular, but I have to say I agree with Arianna. I think it's actually quite harmful. Did you When did you say that? I just did. I'm sorry, maybe 'cause it sounds Iike you're talking with a mouthful of syrup, I just didn't get it. Hey, fuck you, man. Actually, I mean, it seems that these sort of books tend to pander to the Iaziest kind of self-help within the narrowest socioeconomic range. I mean, yeah, you can wish it, and you can do it, but only if you have the educational advantages, the societal advantages that, Iike, what, Well, yeah, you forgot ""want it,"" which is such a big part of the book. I mean, but you know, then again, you just said you haven't read it, so, you know Actually, since I said that, I did read it. And that's another thing, I have to say, aren't ""wish it"" and ""want it"" really the same thing? I mean, your book basically makes three points, and two of them are the same point. Well, you know, I mean, it does seem to be helping a Iot of people, Bill. Well, ""help"" is a strong word. How does this help people, Iike, with cancer or in Darfur? Well, I mean, it's not really for them. It's for, Iike, if you want a car. How does this help you get a car? Well, I mean, it doesn't with that attitude. I mean, you have You have to do some of the work yourself. That's why there are 50 blank pages. That's why I keep it by the phone. I think what this is, is simple exploitation of the American people who could be using the money that they spend to buy this book to actually buy something useful, Iike Iegitimate healthcare that they actually need. You know, what the hell's your problem, Zsa Zsa? What is your problem, Snoopy? Look, what it comes down to is that these false promises of, Iike, a quick fix to any and any problem that you would ever have, what books Iike these suggest is actually damaging to a Iarge, gullible segment of the population. Yeah, aren't you a sitcom writer? I'm an author. I have contributed to the zeitgeist. Do you even know what ""zeitgeist"" means? If I didn't know what it meant, I wouldn't use it, Dana, which is a girl's name, and I'm And you know, I'm not gonna give you I'm not gonna give you the definition right now just for your satisfaction. You know, Brian, I don't think you're in a position, really, here to pull rank on anybody. I mean, yes, Dana has made a career in comedy. I don't think he's ever done anything as Iaughable as this book. Look, all right, well What do you want? I wrote it in a day. Listen, Bill, I am such a big fan of yours. I think you're totally getting the wrong impression of me. I was just trying to write something that would sell. I think it's crap, too. Wow. If I had even one shred of respect for you before this, it's gone now. I mean, if you're gonna take a dump on people, the kind of steaming, stinking, smelly dump that your kind traffics in, at Ieast stand by your dump. Okay, Iook, I'm happy to do that. I'm just I'm just Look, what I was saying Look, just tell me what you want me to say! Bill, he's urinating! -Oh, shit! -That's it! -Look, Bill, can I just -Outside. No, no, no, outside! Outside now! Outside! You get outside! Knock-knock. Hey, Stewie. What do you want? I just want to talk to you about everything that happened. Um You know, you were the only person who believed in me when I was down. This all happened so fast, and I Iost sight of who I was. I mean, you know, sure, you were in a Iittle over your head, but Whoa, whoa, whoa! I was in over my head? Yeah, but, Stewie, this isn't about all the things you did wrong. It's about me apologizing. Okay, then apologize. -I just did. -No, you didn't. You just said it's about me apologizing. That's not actually apologizing. AII right, Stewie, I'm sorry that I made you uncomfortable and put you in a situation that you clearly couldn't handle. Okay, okay, there it is again. What the hell? Stop with that! You're right. You're right. This is about healing. This is not about how many things you messed up along the way. It's about how badly I reacted to them. So, I'm sorry about how badly I reacted to your many errors. That's as good as it's gonna get, isn't it? -Pretty much. -You can't write. English - US - SDH"

It's nice they put Joseph in there, even though he's not really the father. Can you just imagine how it was on that special night in Bethlehem? Doctor, thank goodness you're here. My wife is about to give birth. Oh, my God! What are you doing? This is a manger! Ma'am, you're Iying in manure. You're about to give birth into cow crap. You don't really smell it after a while. Oh, God! You're crowning, and there's flies on its head. Ugh! That's regurgitated cud! No, I can't be a part of this. Look, I'm just gonna Ieave you all the gauze I have. When that thing comes out, just wipe the crap off of him as fast as you can and I don't know, man. Good Iuck to you. I'm so excited to see Santa CIaus. You know what I think is really wonderful? Of all the malls in this great country of ours, he chooses to come here. Year after year. You know? I mean, who are we? You know? I'II tell you who we are. The Iucky ones! Uh-oh. Oh, my God! Look at the Iine. Damn it! We're gonna be here forever. Wait, Iook. There's Quagmire, way up front. We can cut in Iine with him. Wait. Stewie, he doesn't Iike me so GIenn? GIenn Quagmire! Wow! What are you doing here? Hi, Brian. Just waiting for Santa, Iike everyone else. Cool. Cool. We'II just hang with you guys here. Who's this Iittle guy? Is this your nephew? Hey, buddy. You here to see Santa? Yeah. I hope you've been a good boy this year. That Iittle guy is my niece Abby, you douche. Her hair's short because of the chemotherapy. -Uh-oh. -Do you know how much talking it took to get her out of the house because of her no-hair? Oh, gosh, I didn't know. I'm so sorry. You're sorry? For what? That waiting in Iine is such a catastrophe for you that you'd rather destroy the confidence of a 5-year-old cancer patient? Come on. I didn't know she was dying. Who said anything about dying? Uncle GIenn, am I dying? No, sweetheart, you're not dying. 'Cause we're gonna see Santa, and he's gonna bring you a new brain. Get out of here, Brian. Just get out of here. Should have gone into politics, Bri. Now we got to go to the back of the Iine. What the hell? Why isn't it moving? I don't know. It's always the same thing. Some fat kid sitting on Santa's Iap taking all day. And I want a Charles in Charge Iunch box, and I want a Magna Doodle and a new Uno game 'cause I Iost a ""Draw 2"" card. And I want a pet animal that's half-chinchilla and half-mink, 'cause it'd be really soft, and I could call it chink, and that's okay. Geez, doesn't the mall close soon? We've been here forever. Would you relax? We're right here. I'm next. Hello, Santa. Now, we've got a slight problem here, because I have been rather naughty. But you're a businessman, I'm a businessman. I'm sure we can work something out. Wait, what are you doing? Santa? You can't Ieave now! Hey, wait, buddy, buddy, we've been in Iine for, Iike, two hours. Sorry. I'm done. You want your kid to sit on my Iap, meet me at the bar at Applebee's. That sucks. Sorry, Stewie. That son of a bitch. He just turned his back on me. The way reality turned its back on Gary Busey. How am I doing today, Gary Busey? You're doing great! Good! Then I'II keep it up! Peter, come help decorate the Christmas tree. One second, Lois, I'm almost done icing down the walk. Hey, Joe. We're having eggnog and roasted marshmallows. Want some? Boy! Do I! Oh, my God! This is why I Iove the holiday season. Pour me a nice big tall glass God bless us everyone. Hey, give me your keys. I need your car. What? You're not taking my car. Very well, then. You're driving me. Let's go. Driving you where? To the North Pole, to see Santa CIaus. If that beslubbering, onion-eyed maggot-pie thinks he can just blow me off Iike that, he's got another thing coming! Look, Stewie, I know you're disappointed that you didn't get to see Santa, but I'm not driving you to the North Pole. Everyone, Quagmire's niece is in the ICU. Now, I think we should go down there to support him. -What? -Yeah, apparently, something happened at the mall, and she took a turn for the worse. They don't know how much time she has Ieft. Quagmire just called. He's really upset. It doesn't sound Iike he wants us there for some reason, but we should go anyway. AII right, Iet's go to the North Pole. And so Brian and Stewie set off on the road to the North Pole. Hey, you want to hear a real Iive-action fart instead of one of those fake, cartoony ones? We're gonna need another pair of pants and another chair. Hey, Stewie, wake up. We're here. We're at the North Pole. What? North Pole? North Pole! North Pole! There it is! My word, I really must have been asleep! Ah. Look at this. The tip of the Earth, Brian. Okay, Iet's go see Santa CIaus. AII right, Iet's go. Well, this is rather festive, isn't it? Small. Well, it has to be small because of all the tiny elves. That's right. Good point. EIves. Yo, yo, what's up, y'alls? Y'alls ready to kick it in some fine North Pole gear? Brian, why does the North Pole have black teenagers? Uh From Katrina? Okay. And, why are they selling shirts that say, ""Burrillville, Rhode Island?"" 'Cause that's where Santa went to high school. Of course. AII right. Well, I just have one more question, then. Do you think I'm an idiot? Huh? Do you? Look, Stewie, the North Pole is a Iong and dangerous You can't jerk me around when it comes to Santa CIaus, Brian! There is a Ferris wheel here, and a guy hosing vomit! Nobody vomits at the North Pole! Except for Santa's wife, -because she has an eating disorder! -What? Y eah, 'cause he can have anyone he wants, and she knows that! Stewie, just pull yourself together. I won't, Brian! Now you get your ass back into that hippie car of yours and take me to the North Pole, now! Look, I know you're upset. Why don't you just sit down, write out your Christmas Iist, and I promise I will mail it to Santa CIaus? Screw that. This was never about Christmas presents, Brian. Well, then why do you want to go all the way to the North Pole? Because I'm going to kill Santa CIaus! So it turned out Stewie was determined to kill Santa Claus. Would he succeed? Well, let's find out. Wait a minute, why the hell do you want to kill Santa? Because that fat bastard blew me off at the mall, and he shall not go unpunished. Now, Iet's go. I've got it all planned out. I'm gonna see the workshop, pet a few reindeer, take a few pictures of me and Santa, and then I'm gonna blow his goddamn brains out, hopefully with his bitch wife watching. This is ridiculous. We are not going to the North Pole. Trust me, it's a waste of time. You're not gonna find Santa. -Why not? -Because there's no such Because when you get there, you may find out it isn't what you thought it was, and I wouldn't want you to be disappointed. That's it? That's your reason? Well, you know why nothing works out for you, Brian? Because you've got a negative attitude. Like Eeyore. Come on, Eeyore, Iet's go play. I don't feel Iike it. Why are you always in such a bad mood? -I have a nail in my anus. -Oh. That's not fair. I don't think I have a negative attitude, I just I don't think it's a good idea for us to embark on a potentially dangerous journey Stewie? Say ""Yes"" to Iife, Brian! I'II be home for Christmas. Son of a bitch! So, what are we hauling, good buddy? I got a flock of birds that were too tired to fly back north. Boy, this is the way to do it, huh, Jerry? Sure is. Think this makes us Iazy? Nah, we're still in the V-shape. What is this? This is a weird gun. Yeah. Don't touch that. Oh, it's a flare gun. Maybe you should put that back. I'm just holding it. Is this the trigger? Oh, my God, Stewie, you all right? What the hell happened? Just some stupid stuff went down. You could have been killed! I could have been killed! Look at my car! Well, you know, if you had just taken me to the real North Pole to see Santa, none of this would have happened! What is this? What are you doing? Hitching a ride. I'm gonna keep heading north until I find Santa. Stewie, you're not gonna find him. You do what you want, Brian, but I am going to the North Pole and I'm gonna kill that bastard! Stewie, you're putting me in a hell of a position here, but I have no choice. You're not gonna kill Santa CIaus, because he doesn't exist. Really, Brian? He doesn't exist? That's right, he's not real. Interesting. Interesting theory, Brian. Who else isn't real, hmm? You gonna tell me that EImo isn't real? Huh? SpongeBob? Is he not real, Brian? Is SpongeBob not there at the bottom of the ocean giving Squidward the business, hmm? And what about Curious George? Huh? Does he not really exist? Is Curious George not really out there making Iittle boats out of newspapers that he should be delivering? Huh? Educate yourself, you fool. Look, Stewie, if you'd just Iisten for a sec No, you Iisten, Brian! I'II tell you what, you take me to the North Pole, and if Santa isn't there, I'II do something for you. -What? -When Lois does that middle-of-the-night feeding that she doesn't even open her eyes or really wake up, I'II Iet you take that one for me, Brian. -Are you serious? -Quite. Okay, you got a deal. Damn it, it won't turn over. Great! Not even halfway through Canada, and we're stuck. Oh, hey there. You having some car troubles, eh? Yeah, we're trying to get to the North Pole. I don't suppose you're from AAA, are you? -Who? -AAA, you know? A-A-A. Oh, AA, eh? Y eah, I just came from AA. No, not AA. A-A-A. Y eah, that's what I said. AA, eh? So you are with AAA? Oh, no, that's A-A-A. I just came from AA, eh? -Huh? -Stewie, I think he's just a drunk. Well, drunk or not, can you help us? I can if you want to join AA, eh? No, I'm already a member of A-A-A. I need help with the car. Oh, I see. Yeah, Iooks Iike you got some water Ieakage. You might need a hose, eh? Jose, Roberto, whatever. If you've got some Latinos up here that can fix cars, that'd be great. No, I mean, it Iooks Iike you need a part, eh? Well, yeah, when it's fixed, we can celebrate, but Iet's deal with first things first. Well, I can probably take you to a gas station, eh? You have cash, eh? I don't know, my name carries a Iittle weight, but I don't see how that matters here. Look, we don't have enough cash to fix the car, and we're kind of on our way to the North Pole. Oh, a car won't take you there, anyway. But if you Iike, you can take my snowmobile. Really? You'd just give it to us? Sure, that's what Canadian hospitality's all about. If you Iike, you can have all my money and my Ieg. Okay. Why'd we take his Ieg? Well, we're in their country, Brian. We have to observe their customs. Oh, dear. Well, at Ieast we're done with the first Ieg of our journey, Brian. -Ha! -Damn right, ha. Brian, how Iong do you think we've been driving? I don't know, I've Iost track. Besides, dogs don't have a good sense of time. Could be three hours, could be three years, I don't fucking know. Well, we must be pretty far north by now. Yeah, you're right. Look there's the Aurora Borealis. Yes, and there's the Aurora Boreanaz. Hi, there. Things are kind ofbeautiful up north, huh? -Oh, no! -What's the matter? We're out of gas. Out of gas? But, Brian, it's freezing out here! What are we gonna do? I don't know. We'd better think of something. Maybe I can help. There's an old, abandoned hunting cabin about two miles north ofhere. You could spend the night there and then resume your journey in the morning. Thanks, David. Guess there are a few stars in the sky tonight. Come on. Come on, now. Okay, we'II Ieave you alone. AII right, this should do for the night. Look, Stewie, now that we have a moment, I think we should really try to call Lois and tell her where we are. Don't worry. I've got that covered. Hey, Lois, would you make an appointment for me to be neutered in two days? Are you sure, Brian? Yes, I'm sure. And whatever I say in two days, do not let me convince you that I've changed my mind. Wow, you sound pretty serious about this, Brian. Oh, I am. In fact, I have this document that legally binds me to same. Have you had it notarized? No. But a notary should be here any minute. I received a call about notarizing a document, but I am spending the day with my family, so they are here, too. This is my wife, Janice, my daughters, Lisa and Jane, and this is Rosalyn, a friend of our daughter Jane 's. Her family life is rough, so we are kind oflike a second home. -Robert! -Well, it's true. Well, thank you for taking the time to notarize this important document. I'm sure you are quite busy. Yes. We only have a moment, for we are taking a bus tour ofProvidence and other places. The next morning, Stewie and Brian set out on foot for the North Pole. They were cold and tired, but Stewie was determined to carry out his plan to kill Santa CIaus. As Iong as I've got all you people watching, does anyone want to buy some pot? We must be getting close to the Pole. Look at all these igloos. Look, there's a Persian igloo that takes up the whole Iot. My children are teaching your children to smoke at school. -What was that? -I don't know. You know, I think it's my back. Really? You've never mentioned back pain before. Yeah, I try not to mention health problems around the house for fear of being put down. Wow! Looks bottomless. It is bottomless. Who are you? We are the enchanted totem. The enchanted what? The enchanted totem. We hold the key to the bridge of eternal crossing. Which will allow you safe passage across the chasm without end. But first, you must solve our riddle. AII right. Well, we got to get to the North Pole and kill Santa. So, Iet's hear it. The riddle is this. A father and his son are in a car crash. The father is killed and the son is taken to the hospital in critical condition. He needs surgery to save his Iife. But when he is placed on the operating table, the doctor says, ""I cannot operate on this boy, he is my son."" Who is the doctor? Wow! This is a toughie. Y eah, I think we can rule out the mother right away. Yeah, definitely. Maybe it's a my-two-dads kind of situation? Right. Like they don't know which one was the real father, so they both call themselves Dad. So, wait, were both the guy in the car and the doctor biological parents? Yes. And the guy in the car was the biological father. Crap. Well, maybe the doctor is the mother. No, that's just crazy. I got it, the dad in the car has to be a vampire, he's already dead, and he's a doctor. That's pretty smart. Let's go with that. Okay. The doctor is the dad, who is a vampire. That is correct! Terrific. Thanks. You're welcome. You know, this used to be all orange trees. My God! We made it, Brian! The North Pole! See? Boom! Right there! I told you! This is where Santa CIaus Iives! In your face! I don't believe it. It's here. Damn right, it's here! Now, while you think about the fact that you're never going to enjoy a nocturnal breast-feeding from Lois, I shall open the gate. This can't be it. This can't be Santa's workshop. This Iooks Iike Bridgeport, Connecticut. Oh, boy, get ready for the Ietters. Dear Family Guybastards, who the hell do you think you are? I'II have you know that Bridgeport is among the world Ieaders in abandoned buildings, shattered glass, boarded-up windows, wild dogs and gas stations without pumps. So eat my piss, Jew writers. Well, whatever sort of trick this is, I will not be deterred. I'm not Ieaving until Santa CIaus is dead by my hand! Oh, my God! You're Santa CIaus! Yeah. Who are you? I'm Stewie Griffin, and I'm going to kill you! -Ah. Thank God! -What? Do it! PIease! Put me out of my misery! You want me to kill you? Come on! What are you waiting for! Pull the trigger! Well, there isn't a great deal of sport in that. Oh, my God, are you all right? I'm okay. I'm okay. I just need to catch my breath. I don't understand. I thought you were supposed to be jolly and happy. I used to be, a Iong time ago. I made toys for Iittle boys and girls. I Ioved my work, and they Ioved me. But it just got out of hand. The world's population kept growing and growing. Kids wanted more toys, fancier toys! We used to make wooden choo-choos and rag dolls. You ever try to make an iPod? I've got orders for millions of 'em! Oh, that reminds me. I need a new version of Quicken. Look at the toxic waste we're producing. In fact, I think the toxins are taking even more of a toll than the inbreeding. -Inbreeding? -Take a Iook! I started with one family of magic elves, and every year I needed more and more to keep up. Now they're just a sickly race of mutated genetic disasters. At Ieast 60% of them are born blind. The workload destroys them, but they don't know anything else. It's gotten so their instincts take over, and near the end, they just walk out into the snow and die. Then the reindeer eat them, which has turned the reindeer into wild, feral creatures with a bloodlust for elfflesh. I don 't even pray for them anymore. Seems pointless. What god would allow this? This is in none of the songs or poetry. It's a horror show up here! How could you Iet this happen? Me? I didn't do this. Christmas did! Each bell would peal with a silvery zeal as the holiday feeling was filling us But now instead all we're feeling is dread because Christmastime is killing us Each Christmas list gets us more and more pissed Till the thought of existence is chilling us I'll tell you what Shove your list up your butt Because Christmastime is killing us But can 't you see that what you do is a dream come true? Can 't you see that every smile makes it all worthwhile? No, screw you. It's all but through There 's too much to do All those dreams are nightmares And blank icy stares Each little elf used to fill up a shelf Making playthings and selflessly thrilling us Now they're on crack and it feels like lraq Because Christmastime is killing us Each model train only heightens the pain of a workload that's draining and drilling us Fingers all bleed And look that guy just peed Because Christmastime is killing us But can 't you see our point of view? We rely on you Can 't you see that Christmas cheer gets us through the year? My whole crew is black and blue Can 't you take a clue? You may think I look great But I'm 28 Each jingle bell is a requiem knell And while you think it's swell We are toiling in hell Take a look, you can tell As a man I'm a shell Because Christmastime is killing us Killing us! Christmastime is killing us! So, Brian and Stewie found Santa CIaus, but he sure wasn't what they expected. It turned out the increasing demands of Christmas had all but destroyed the poor old man. Okay, Iook at this. Somebody gave me a Iittle remote control helicopter. Pretty cool, huh? Oh, it's broken. I don't know, boys. He's in rough shape. Doctor, you've got to do something for him. It's Christmas Eve! Christmas is the problem. He can't keep this pace up anymore. If he goes out tonight, he'II die. Well, then who's gonna deliver all the presents? We will. -What? -What? Stewie, Iook, you were right. Santa is real, and he needs our help. Don't worry, Santa. We'II make sure there's Christmas this year. Thank you, Brian. That brings me peace in this hour. I'II be with AIIah soon. What? He doesn't know what he's saying, he's delirious. Look, you'd better get moving. AII right, Stewie, Iet's go get the sleigh ready. Is anyone else a Iittle freaked out by that AIIah thing? Never mind that, Iet's just get going. -Ready to join the mile high club? -What? AII right. Let's get those reindeer hooked up and get out of here. Okay. The elves are bringing them now. My God! That doesn't Iook good. God. That elf getting killed gave them all erections. AII right, Brian. Let's do this. Go on. Giddyup. Come on, you dumb deer. It's not working. I think they need to be coaxed. Santa said they eat elf flesh. Excuse me? Sir? Mr. EIf? Sir? Hello? Young man? I don't think he even knows where he is. Do you want to just Y eah, I mean, I'II just try and do it, I guess. Hey. Hey, fella? Um Okay. Bye. Hey, Brian, Iook. That one reindeer just kind of pooped in the other reindeer's face and the other reindeer just kind of ate it. Isn't Christmas magical? AII right, according to this map, we're approaching the northeast coast of the U.S. Get ready to Iand. AII right, Bri, this is it, our first town. I'm gonna head for that roof. Why are we tilting? Look, I've never Ianded one of these things before, okay? You're coming in too fast! Look out! AII right, this is good. In and out of this house and onto the next one. What about the reindeer? Yeah, we'II cut them down afterwards. Now Iet's get down the chimney. Ow! Bitch! Okay, Iet's get the presents under the tree. -AII right, you have 'em? -I thought you had them. For the Iove of Christ, they're still in the sleigh! Crap. On the roof? No, it's in the yard. Oh, my God. Didn't you unlock the door when we Ieft? No, you were the Iast one out! How the hell are we gonna get back inside? AII right, find a rock. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing? -I'm putting out the presents. -Not Iike that you're not. Tall in the back, short in the front. And show some care, for God's sake. You know, those aren't socks and underwear donated by the fire department to some battered women's shelter. Those are Santa gifts, Brian. You know, you have to What are you doing? Did you just eat that whole cookie off the mantel? What? They Ieft it out for Santa. We're Santa. Yeah, but you're not supposed to eat all of it. You take a bite and a sip of milk. That's how the kids know Santa was here! -Don't yell at me. -I'm not yelling at you. I'm just I'm telling you how it's done. They need some kind of indication that Santa was here. Okay, how about this? Look. Hey, now they know he was here, see? -Stop it! -Look, I'm here giving out free presents! AII right, I'II eat the damn cookies if I want! You know what? I might even make a sandwich! Wait. Where are you going? I'm going into the kitchen. I'm gonna make a sandwich, get some chips or something. Brian, knock it off! Oh, man. You jackass! Hey, who the hell are you? -Hello? -What are you doing in my house? We're Santa CIauses. Yeah, you're Santa CIaus. That's why you broke in through the window. I'm calling the cops. No, no, no. I can explain. We came down the chimney, but we forgot the presents. It's actually It's kind of a funny story. What the hell did you do? He was gonna call the cops, man! You can't call the cops on Santa. Now, help me move this guy's body! He's still alive! AII right, tie him up. I'm gonna make it Iook Iike a burglary. AII right, Iook, Iet's just go. Right, right. We'II go. I'm gonna rewrap this bat for Johnny. Let me just clean his father's blood and hair off it. Daddy, I want a drink of water. Shit. Hey, there. How you doing? -Who are you? -I'm Santa. You're Santa? Do you have my new cell phone? Well, I'm not sure it was on my Iist. Do you have her cell phone, other Santa? Why, I have a cell phone. So, we do have your cell phone! Well It's I have my cell phone. No, we have your cell phone. Give her the cell phone, Brian. There you go. Merry Christmas! Yeah. Merry Christmas. It has all my fucking contacts in it. Who is Jennifer-Pizza-Hut-big-boobs-bad-face? Okay, Iook why don't you go back to bed, all right? Who are you? Where's Dan? -Oh, my God! -Oh, crap! -Quick, Stewie! Get the bat! -Help! Help! Mommy! It's okay. It's okay. Brian, see if you can find some duct tape! -Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Mommy! Mama! AII right, Iet's get this place cleaned up. AII right, that's the Iast of the blood. Go check on the other kid. -What other kid? -Johnny, the one who's getting the bat. Stewie, there's only one bedroom up here. What? Do you have a brother? Well, then who the hell is Oh, my God, we're in the wrong house. Damn it, we tripped the alarm. Brian, the cops are coming. Let's go! What? We're just Ieaving Iike this? What about not wanting to ruin Christmas? It's already ruined! This was one house. We've been here for an hour and a half! An hour and First of all, we're not even Santa anymore. This has been a home invasion. But an hour and a half, Brian! It's gonna be Iight in six hours, and we have to deliver to the whole rest of the world! There's two apartment buildings on this block alone! No wonder Santa Iost his mind. This is ridiculous! We can't do this! Nobody can. It's inhuman! AII right, come on, Iet's get out of here! -Damn, what about the reindeer? -The hell with the reindeer! Look, they're all eating each other, anyway! Besides, we don't need 'em. I made a few modifications. Hang on. That was a disaster. I can't believe it. We were supposed to save Christmas, and we completely blew it. We failed Santa. No. No, we didn't fail Santa. The world failed Santa. He gives and gives and gives, and everyone just takes him for granted. Hell, I didn't even think he existed until Iast night. Well, what are we supposed to do now? Christmas is doomed. Maybe, but there is one thing we can do. Move over. Lois, there's no presents under the tree! What? Oh, my God. Joe, did you get any Christmas presents? -No! - Me, neither! I got eight mediocre things. Good morning, Quahog. Our top story today, Santa Claus skips Christmas. Hopeful citizens worldwide woke up to disappointment this morning when they discovered no gifts from Santa under their Christmas trees. Local officials are going with the theory that everyone was bad this year. The investigation continues into this mysterious Wait! I know what happened to Christmas! Brian? Santa CIaus! That's right. It's Santa CIaus. And you've got to Iisten to me. The reason there was no Christmas this year is that this man is sick, very sick. And he needs our help. He's been bludgeoned by years of greed and avarice. The workload offilling our Christmas lists has overwhelmed him. And at the rate he 's going, he may not make it another year. But there 's a way for us to help him. If all of us, everywhere, can just cut back our demands and ask for only one Christmas present every year, there may still be hope. I know it's in our nature to resist sacrifice, even in hard times, but if we don't, we may have to give up Christmas altogether. Well, folks, you heard it here first on Channel Five News. Looks like we have a choice. One Christmas gift a year for each one of us. Can we live with that? I can. So can I. -Me, too. -I can, too. I can Iive with that. -Count me in. -One is enough. Aye. I can. One gift is okay. I can Iive with it. Okay, just one. But if it's a gym membership, somebody's getting punched in the fuckin' face. We can get out ofany mess If we learn to live with less And with Santa 's love there's nothing to fear All these happy wishes and lots of Christmas cheer Is all I really want this year!

I just want to yell at customers when they walk in the door. (speaking faux Japanese) Here comes a black guy! Peter, you're not getting money for that or anything else. We're running seriously low on cash right now. In fact, I may have to get my own full-time job. Geez. Are we really living that close to the edge? You know we are, Brian. Why do you think we waited so long to take you to the groomer's last month? Hey, isn't it time for me to get a haircut? Oh, no. I think you just got one. Are you sure? 'Cause I feel like my nails are really long. Yeah, I'll check, but I'm pretty sure it's not for another couple of weeks. (panting) What day is this? Like it or not, we're going to have to start living on a strict budget for a while. Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker, and this is  News  I thought you were going to sing with me, Joyce. Okay. Our top story tonight. The Rhode Island State Lottery has climbed to a record $150 million jackpot. That's right, Tom. Powerball fever has officially gripped Quahog. We sent Channel Five News Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa around town to get the public reaction. Mayor West, what do you plan to do if you win the lottery? Well, I'd finally splurge and buy myself one of those fancy four-piece suits. I'd like to join your country club. I assume that won't be a problem. And how about you, every Persian guy in the world? ALL: White BMW. There you go, Lois. That's the answer right there. We'll just win the lottery. In fact, I'm going to go buy my winning ticket right now. Peter, what's wrong? It's, uh, nothing. I'm just going to wait a minute. There's teenagers in skinny jeans out there. Everyone, I got big news. We are going to be rich. Oh, my God, Peter. There are thousands of lottery tickets here. Where did you get the money for all these? Simple. I took out a second mortgage on the house. What?! Peter, this is idiotic. Your odds of winning are like 100 million to one. Don't you know the lottery is just a tax on stupid people? Would you be saying that if the prize was 150 million bags of the neighbor's garbage? But it's not. I mean I mean, is it? It's that-that is an unrealistic, unfair question. Peter, Brian's right. How can you be so irresponsible? You take these tickets back right now. No way, Lois. We're going to win. I got lots of good karma built up from doing those USO shows. (laughter) So, apparently, they found a weapon of mass destruction-- my putter. (laughter) All right, boys. Go get 'em over there. And now, please welcome Mr. Bruce Jenner. (cheering and applause) (jazzy burlesque music plays) (sailors cheering and whistling) Just wanted to remind you fellas what you're all fighting for. Okay, this is it, you guys. They're going to announce the winning lottery numbers. Time for the Griffin family to meet its destiny. When we lose, I'm getting a divorce. Understood. We're here live in our studio where a checkout girl in a cheap dress who wants to be a model is ready to draw the winning numbers. ""E!"" TUCKER: That's a three, honey. Turn it around. This. Thirty-one. Spooky ghost mouth. That's a zero. Snowman. Eight. Two sailboats. Forty-four. Seventeen. No, that's Oh, yes, that is 17. She's good at 17. Well, folks, those are our winning numbers. Good luck to all of our Twenty-four! No, that's it. We're done. Anyone watching, do not count 24. Somebody turn the machine off. N-Nikki, Nikki, that's good. That's good. Go go wait in my car. All right, you did good. Going to take her to Walt's Roast Beef. All right, kids, we got 200,000 lottery tickets we got to check. All right, how do you want to do this? A static shot of the house where night turns into day or a montage song that over-explains what we're doing? Um, that second one sounds like it could be funny.    Checking lottery tickets   Looking at the numbers   And seeing if they match the ones on the news   If they do, then we're winners   If they don't, then we put them   In the designated pile   For tickets we already checked   This is taking forever   That's why Brian is yawning   And Stewie's rubbing his eyes   The montage is almost over   That's why the music and the vocals   Are fading out right now.  Well, that's it. Three days wasted looking through 200,000 lottery tickets. Those weren't the lottery tickets. That was a test. These are the lottery tickets. Is this another test? Yes. These aren't the real lottery tickets, either. These are the real lottery tickets. So, in addition to buying you had 400,000 fake ones printed up? I had to be sure. Oh, my God. We won! What? Let me see that. Yes! We won the lottery! I'm getting a penis butler. Sir? All right, butle my penis. Butle it! This is awesome. Now that we're rich, our lives are going to be so much better. You sure it was such a good idea to cash that lottery check? It seems foolish to have all this money lying around. Oh, you'd rather have it down at the bank where the Jewish guys can leer at it? Yeah! All right! Money! (whistling) Whoo-hoo! Whoo! (phone rings) Hello? CARTER: Did you blow all your money yet? No, Daddy. All right. Call me when you blow all your money. Love you. Bye. All right, so how are we going to spend our winnings? I'm going to get some supermarket fried chicken and eat it until I'm nauseous. I'm going to finally get my gal that doodad she's been wantin'! I'm going to get a floor mirror to squat over and see what's making all that noise. Okay, everybody just calm down. We're not going to go crazy spending our winnings, and we're not going to let this money change us. What are you talking about? This money is our ticket to the good life, starting now. I just bought a giant room full of gold coins, and I'm going to dive into it like Scrooge McDuck. (drumroll) Aah! It's not a liquid! It's a great many pieces of solid matter that form a hard, floor-like surface! Aah! Peter, what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at work? I quit my job, Lois. You what? Yeah, we're rich now. I don't need to be working. Ah, you should've been there, Lois. I told Angela what she could do with that job, just like I always fantasized. Angela, I just want to thank you for several extremely pleasurable years working for this corporation. Uh, certain unexpected developments have created a situation where I am no longer in need of employment. Uh, I would be remiss, however, if I did not extend my gratitude to you for your unwavering fairness and belief in me, and there is a giant poo on your desk. Hey, Horace, another round for everybody. (patrons cheering) Gosh, Peter, you're really being generous with your money. Hey, what's the point of being rich if you can't share it with your pals, huh? Okay, wait, I-I got one. Who would you rather do? Susan Boyle or a sex doll that's been passed around a fraternity? Well, have they been cleaning the doll? Please, these guys are Betas-- they're total animals. Hey, I got one, Peter. What would you rather do? Tread water where you are right now or increase your net worth fivefold within the next Huh? What? I what are you talking about? Well, my friend Marty is a whiz with chemistry, and he says he's come up with a new penis enlargement pill, and if we can bankroll him $100,000 in startup money, he'll triple our investment in a year. Well, uh gee, I-I'm I don't, uh Peter, I've taken the liberty of mocking up some sales projections. Wow, that's pretty good. And this would be our net profits. Yikes. You know, Peter, uh, Bonnie's birthday is coming up, and I'll be gol-darned if I didn't go ahead and promise her that Stevie Nicks would come to our house and sing three songs to her. (chuckling): Boy, do I got a big mouth, huh? Yeah, if you're going to open your mouth with the missus, stick to kisses, huh? (laughs) (both laughing) What neat humor. What neat humor. So what do say, Peter? Can you help us out? Of course I can, you dope. We're pals, right? There you go. Hey, Horace, give us three shots of your best bourbon. And have that Russian waiter I like bring it over. (jaunty intro plays)  La la la la la la la la la la la   Trololo   La la la la la la la la la la la   Ho ho ho ho ho   Ho ho ho ho ho   Ho ho ho ho ho   Ho ho ho ho ho   La la la la la la la la la la la la   La la la la la la la la la la   Ah la la la   La la la la la la   La la la la la   Bop ba da da da da da da da   La la la la la la.  Boy, you wouldn't guess from that smile that all his kids were stillborn, huh? All right, well, thanks again, Peter. I got to head out. I told my mother I'd visit her in the hospital. Yeah, and I got to work. I'm flying a leg to Minneapolis tonight. Oh. Yeah, I-I-I understand. You you've got other things to do. I-I just wrote you guys a couple of checks, but no, you you-you-you do your things. What? No, I mean, I-I'm just saying, I-I thought friends hang out, do things with each other. You know, especially when one friend gives the other friends a whole bunch of money. Oh. Well, I guess I could stick around. Yeah, and I-I guess the co-pilot can fly the plane. She's a woman and passengers are usually okay with that. I once saw a deodorant commercial that had a woman pilot. That's more like it. From now on, we're all gonna do whatever I want to do. 'Cause I'm the one with the dough. Okay, I guess that's fair. Good. 'Cause what I want to do is stay here, get drunk and watch TV. ANNOUNCER: We now return to Michael McDonald During Allergy Season. (gasping): Haa Haa-haa Haa-haa-haa-haa-haa Haa (sneezes):  Haa-chu!  Hey, Peter, you wanted me to watch the entire first season of True Blood and come show you where there was boob? That's right, I don't want to see any actual True Blood, just boob. Yeah, well, I found some. No! Anna Paquin boob does not count as real boob! That's like looking at a 12-year-old boy. Geez. Y-You should know that, Joe! You should definitely know that! Sorry, Peter. Sorry doesn't show me nipples worth seeing! And as for you, Anna, you're dreadful and so is the program. I didn't write it. Yeah, but you know the people who do. That Alan Ball-- you know him, right? Yeah. How come everything he writes is so dreary? I don't know. Tell him to cheer up! Things ain't so bad! This is a weird episode. Okay, Quagmire, I want you to take the first bite out of this fudge pop, because that first bite is the one that really hurts. Well, okay. (grunting) Ah! Ow! Ow! Yeah, that's right ""Ow."" Now, you swallow that. Don't you dare spit that out. What's the difference? You got what you wanted. I said swallow it! (gulps) Now, smear what's left of it on your face and look at me with your mouth open. Look at yourself, you filthy whore. I don't even want this now. Okay, guys, now you're gonna do a synchronized duet of ""Makin' Whoopee"" while I shoot you with this BB gun. That doesn't sound safe. Action! (piano playing)  Another bride   She looks so gay   Another June   Oh, what a day   Another sunny honeymoon   Hip hip hoor  (screams)  Another seas  (screams)  Another reason   For making whoopee  Look, you aren't gonna shoot us in the eye, are you, Peter? Oh, no, Joe. I wouldn't try to shoot you in the eye.  A lot of shoes   We're throwing shoes   A lot of rice   It's all so ni  (screams) Peter, it was really close to my eye! Relax, Joe. I'm nowhere near your eye. Hey, Joe, open your eye. (screaming) Gotcha. What the hell, Peter?! You shot him in the eye! Keep singing, you. And keep your chin up, so I can see your throat. No, no screw this! You're a jerk! Jerk? What kind of a way is that to talk to your friend who gives you money? Go to hell, Peter! We don't need your money! And we don't need friends like you! Yeah! We're out of here! Fine, go on. I don't care. I don't need you, I got money! You know, Peter, you used to be a great guy. But ever since you won that lottery (screaming) Come on, Joe! (bleep) this guy! Aah! I'm here to audition for Fiddler on the Roof. Come right in. Peter, my God, what the hell are you wearing? It's a solid gold tuxedo, Lois. I had to fight three rappers down at the Nonsense Store for this. Look, Peter, this is not who we are. I'm worried the money is changing this family, and not the way you hoped. Well, I was hoping it would make you shut up, so you're right. You know, I spoke to Bonnie this morning, and she said you haven't talked to Joe or Quagmire in two weeks. Who cares? I don't need Quagmire. And I certainly don't need Joe. I got Money Joe. (laughs) That's a good one, Money Joe! I don't like what this money is doing to us. It's even affecting Brian and Stewie. (yawns) I think I'm gonna take a nap. What, here? Yeah, I had a giant mobile put in the sky so I can sleep wherever I want. (mobile playing soft music) (sighs) This is nice. I hope that bear comes around soon. That's sort of my fave-- Oh, look, the bear! And it's not just them. Chris has also been developing some very expensive tastes. Model glue, sir? Well, what do we have today? Today we have a recent vintage procured just this morning from Michael's Hobby Shop. Yes, that's very nice. Bring me my finest rag. Your fancy rag, sir. You are relieved for the evening. (inhales deeply) You don't see poor people doing this! Lois, don't you understand? We don't got any of our old problems anymore. We don't have to worry about paying bills, we don't have to worry about saving dough. All we got to do is enjoy ourselves. Interested? (gasps) Oh, my God. Peter, it's beautiful! Is it a blood diamond? Ah, the bloodiest. The two kids who found it were forced to murder each other. Oh, Peter, I love it. Hey, you want to watch a DVD of the murder while we do it? I already watched it eight times, so I know exactly which part I want to blam at. Chris, Meg, now that I'm a rich father, you will try to impress me, and I will remain distant. Go. Um, say, Dad, did I tell you I got second place in the yacht race? Hmm. Sounds like somebody's dad is happier than me right now. Well, um, how about this, Dad? The school paper is doing a story about me. That's because I had it arranged. Uh, I was thinking about joining the Army? No. Meg, as a girl, your life holds no merit. And, Chris, try as you may, you will never be as good as your older brother who died. He was good at sports and talking. Now, pardon me while I look at scrimshaw through a magnifying glass. Ah, brave men all. Lost sons of New Bedford. That's good scrimshaw. Ah, I never thought I'd be having high tea at the Park Barrington every single day. Yes, it's nice to eat in a sea of white faces, isn't it? Waiter, have the chef prepare a bucket of your finest caviar, and then give it a helicopter tour of the city. Very good, sir. Very good indeed. I hope it enjoys it as much as that Maine lobster I ordered. And over there is the Rhode Island State House, the second largest self-supporting marble dome in North America. Why the (bleep) am I doing this? I could've just said I did it. Sir, about your bill Oh, don't worry, Carstairs, there's ample gratuity on there for you. (chuckles): Nyah. Well, actually, sir, your card has been declined. (laughs): Oh, really? Well, I'm sure a brief call to my accountant will resolve this to our mutual satisfaction. Hello, Schnozzenstein? This is Peter Griffin. There seems to be some issue with our credit. I told Carstairs you'd set everything straight. What do you mean I'm broke?! What about all that money I sent to the Gayman Islands? They did what with it?! No, I don't want it back! I'm gonna miss you, Carstairs. I shall miss you, too, sir. With no one to look after, Carstairs fell into a deep depression from which he never emerged. He died two weeks later. Some say of a broken heart. What, sir? But that was Carstairs. I can't believe it. We lost everything. What do we do now? Well, seems like our only hope is the lottery. Holy (bleep), we won twice and we're right back here again. We had $150 million, and we blew through it in a month. Yeah, but on the bright side, if this hadn't happened, we never would've met Kyle. Hey. Hello. Hey there. Hi. What's up? And that's not even Kyle. Peter, we can't live like this. Well, what are we supposed to do, Lois? Everything we had is gone! We have friends, Peter. Not anymore, we don't. They're good people. They'll listen. And they'll care what happens to us, even after everything that's happened. You know, I'm still young enough you can drop me at the fire station, no questions asked. Well, well. Look who it is. Who is it? It's me, Peter. I'm standing right here. This is a glass eye, Peter. They had to remove the one you shot. Oh, boy, that whole day was a mess, huh? What happened to you, anyway? You look terrible. Look, you guys, I messed up bad. Winning the lottery was the worst thing that ever happened to me and my family. I thought being rich would solve all my problems, but all it did was make me forget what was important. Like who my real friends are. I don't expect you to forgive me, but if, for some reason, you do, you can find me in a cardboard box on the corner of Meeting and Thayer. Peter, wait. That corner's a bit of a hike for me. I'd rather just come see you at home. What-- where'd you get this kind of money? The penis enlargement pill you gave me the startup money for. It turned a pretty nice profit. I guess it's only fair that I give you my percentage so you can get your house back. Quagmire, I don't know what to say. Thank you. You're welcome. And if it makes you feel better, it was money well spent. Just ask Sandra the waitress over there. We had a great time last night. PETER: Tough girl. Made it into work. Boy, I got to say, it's good to be home. Yeah. Despite all the ups and downs, things turned out for the best. I mean, really, we're no worse off than we were before. Plus, we learned something. And you can't put a price on that. Look, Lois, we all know what happened. We're all depressed. All right, let's just go to different rooms and stare blankly out the window, saying nothing. Congratulations to tonight's sweepstakes winner, Daniel San Martin Marrero. MODEL: Shapes. Shut up."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Our top story tonight, we continue to track the progress of Hurricane Flozell. The National Weather Service has issued a Severe Hurricane Advisory, and is urging everyone to stay indoors for at least the next 36 hours. No! What happened?! The wind must have knocked the satellite dish loose. Aw, crap. And I was going to watch G.I. Jose. Oh, no! You cut your forehead! What do we do? Hey, kids if you have an open wound, get some dirt or kitty litter and rub it in there to stop the bleeding. Then get some sleep and wait for the body to heal itself. Now we know. And like I always say: ""Remember, you know enough.""  G.I. Jose!  Nice. Brian, what are you doing? Geez, Stewie. Scared the crap out of me. Whatcha got there? Okay, I'll tell you; but you can't tell anyone. All-All right? You have to be really cool about this. Yeah, of course. These are mushrooms. It's a psychedelic drug. Makes you see weird things and feel happy for a few hours. I figure we're going to be stuck inside f a while with this storm, so it'll be a fun way to pass the time. Okay. Are you gonna be cool? Oh yeah, I'm totally cool about that. I-I-I-I have a lot of friends who do it, and they're willing to do it around me all the time, because they know I'm so cool about it and I don't judge them. So, you know, go ahead Well, here we go. Yup, that's what my friends say, too. ""Well, here we go."" Oh dude, I think I can feel it, too. I'm gettin' a context high. I'm bored. Yeah, this sucks. What are we supposed to do all day? Well, how about we play charades? Ooh! Yeah. O-okay. Me first! Me first! Okay, it's a movie. All right? Movie. Movie. Peter, there's no talking in charades. O-Okay, sorry, sorry. Okay. (whispers) Movie. Peter! Sorry. Sorry. Okay, one word. Peter, you're still talking! Okay, okay. Right, right, right. Fletch. Is it Fletch? It is Fletch. What do you wanna do now? I got an idea. How about you all sit there quietly while I make ""Dad"" noises? Brah-ha-hah! Brah-ha! Brah! Schumai. Myah!  go to the john. Boy, the rain's really comin' down. I know, I've never seen anything like it. But it's kinda nice for us all to be together like this, huh?   So, what do you guys wanna do now? Oh, hey, I know! Let's play finger-bang. Bang! Bang! I'm gonna finger- bang you, Chris. Not if I finger-bang you first, Dad! Bang! Bang! I'm gonna finger-bang the two of you at the same time. Bang! Bang! Hey, me too! Bang! Oh, no one wants to get finger-banged by you, Meg. Why don't you just go do that to yourself, Meg? I think I'm gonna be sick. Brian?! I'm gonna cut my ear off to prevent World War Two. Oh, God! Oh, God! I wonder Aha! What the hell were you trying to do, man?! Those mushrooms are messin' you up! Lesbians and deaf women wear the same clothes. Yeah, yeah, they sure do, buddy. All right, just stay calm, Brian. You'll get through this. I mean, you got through seeing Lady Gaga naked. Okay, five minutes, Miss Ga-- gina big! And I will be right back with your Evian. Don't worry, Brian. I'm gonna stay by your side all night. All right? Shh. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. Do you like my soothing voice? Do you like my soothing voice? Re-re-re-re-return the map. Re-re-re-re-return what you have stolen from me.   No! Oh, hey, I got an idea. Let's have a sing-a-long. Okay, I'm gonna sing the opening chase music from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Feel free to join in.   Dammit, Meg! Will you stop that?! That is so annoying! Oh that was annoying?! What about your stupid, obnoxious humming?! Meg, don't talk to your father like that! Yeah, shut up, Meg. No! You shut up, Chris! I am sick of all you guys ganging up on me! You guys all think you're so much better than me! Oh, Meg. That is the least fancy thing I have ever heard. Shh. There, there, there. Everything's gonna be fine. You're all right. I think I'm I think I'm dying. Jane Fonda. Is that i-i-is that is that is that right? Yeah, that's right, buddy. Totally Jane Fonda. It's gonna be okay. Your pal Stewie is right here. Just relax and get some rest Brian. Hide!  The wheels on the bus go round and round   Round and round   Round and round   The wheels on the bus go round and round   All through the town  Peanut! Peeper Wanna have (hissing) sex? Groggety! Slip me some tongue. Did you try the chicken, buddy? I think you gave me worms, Brian. Brian Brian Brian Brian Brian! Brian. Uh, Stewie. Eh, uh Stewie? Yeah, I'm right here. Oh, my God. Your lip looks really weird. Can we fix that? L-Let's get that out of there. Ew. Oh, I'm so thirsty. Let's get you downstairs so you can drink some water. All right, let's go, buddy. Let's get you some water. Okay, now-- Now, h-h-hold on. Hold on. Let me put the bowl down first. You're gonna spill it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down. Look, Meg, I don't know what your problem is. I thought Dad's humming was pretty entertaining. You know what? This is what I'm talking about. This is a perfect example. You're my brother. You're supposed to be on my side, and you're such a bastard to me. How am I a bastard?! Oh, you want the full story? Meg, please. Not now, Mom. I think Brian's getting a little water in there. Chris, you treat me like you hate me, and I don't know why. You say hurtful things to me constantly. Do you have any idea what that feels like? What if I said those things to you? What if I started calling you a fat, zitty loser, who has no friends and smells like an old woman who has birds for pets? Still drinkin'. Is it too much to ask to be treated with a little decency from my brother? Maybe show me some kind of kindness by not jumping on the ""Let's get Meg"" family bandwagon? Aw. Alright, Meg, that's enough. You've had your little dramatic outburst. Hey, I got an idea, Mom. How about we talk about Chris' mother? Huh? Why don't we talk about you? Oh, for God's sake. Look, let's not turn this into some big thing, okay? Oh Oh Oh, God, that feels so much better. You know, Brian, you may be a dog, but you're a pretty cool cat.  Stewie just said that!  Take it home with ya! Hey Hey, everyone. I'm sensing a lot of negativity here. What's going on? Yes. You're right, Brian. There is. Meg seems to think she's taking some kind of stand here that's gonna make us all feel like we're inadequate. My God, you're condescending. Geez, look at those two. They're goin' at each other like an Italian guy and a black woman. Hey, you can't park here! Excuse me? Having been officially challenged by her natural enemy, the black female prepares for combat by taking off her many rings. Meanwhile, the Italian male looks around to make sure the other Italian males are indeed seeing what he is seeing. Sensing the impending battle, a flock of Jews flies quickly away, as avoiding confrontation is their best chance for survival.   Look, the bottom line here, Meg, is that you're just taking your own problems out on everyone else. Oh, my problems? Oh, I see. Is this coming from my role model mother? The shoplifter, the drug addict, the porn star, the whore who let Gene Simmons and Bill Clinton go to town on her? Oh, so what? All those things are behind me now. I'm a better person now because of those experiences. Are you? Are you a better person? What's your point, Meg? My point is that with all the irresponsible, reckless, idiotic behavior in your past, that somehow, somehow you have the nerve, the arrogance to consistently and ruthlessly point out my shortcomings. Alright, well, fine, okay? I'm not the perfect mother. Who is? Oh, not only are you not the perfect mother. You're the farthest thing from. From the moment you gave birth to me, I had to trust you. I had no choice. I needed you to protect me from the world. To to be my guide, to help me navigate the difficult, confusing, and vulnerable journey to becoming a person. You have done none of those things. You're my mother, and you took a child's trust and smashed it into bits in a 17-year-long mission to destroy something that you killed a long time ago. And honestly, when I turn 18 I-I don't know that I ever want to see you again. Oh wow, everybody's already tweeting ""Stewie Just Said That."" You're right. You're right. I'm a terrible mother. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry, Meg. Can you ever forgive me? Oh, God. And you never let Dad stir the paint anymore, whatever that means. I didn't know you knew that, Meg, but I'm glad you brought it up. Oh, Meg, I don't know what to say. All of those things you said about me are true. I have been a very bad mother to you. I have no excuse. I just have this horrible, overwhelming desire to point out faults in you. I don't know where it comes from. Maybe it's because I'm self-conscious about being a bad parent. I'm just, I'm so disgusted with my behavior. And I'm so sorry, Meg. Yeah, you're a bitch. Well, you know, I, I been sorta just hangin' back here, takin' all this in, 'cause I didn't think I had a dog in this fight, but my money's on Harry Potter over there. Oh, you think that's funny, fat ass? Well, I don't know if it's funny. I-I think it's clever. I mean, y-y-you got the big glasses there I-I-I don't know. T-T-Tell me, tell me what's on your mind. Oh, I'll tell you, Mister Selfish-ass Dad. Hey. That's ""Mister Mister selfish-ass Dad"" to you, young lady. Oh God, is she gonna do me next? You are completely selfish, and totally irresponsible as a father. All right, I see what's goin' on here. You're in love with your old man. You have no education, you have no interests, you just do whatever reckless thing you want to do whenever you want to do it without regard for anyone else. Oh, oh, and when you're not terrorizing the community with your impulsive escapades, you're being a total jerk to your family. You shove your daughter's face in your ass and you fart on it. If someone in the outside world could see the way you treat me, you would be in jail! Oh, ha ha. Oh, this is amusing to you. Well, see if you find this funny. I like where this is going. You are a fat, lazy, abusive, blue-collar Irish Catholic dad who drinks way too much and barely makes enough money to support his family. You've lived half your life, and you have nothing to show for it. Your only arguable accomplishments are your kids, and look at us; we're a disaster. Eh, watch it. You're a total and complete embarrassment in every possible way. Take a good look at yourself, Peter Griffin. You're a waste of a man. Wait a second, these are criticisms. Hey, Lois, tell her to knock it off. Oh, and where the hell were you when she was laying into me? I was thinking about getting a fancy cane. Maybe getting more attention from strangers. Have either of you guys been listening to me? Do you both just have your heads up your asses? Dad did! Look, he's got crap on his ears! That's unrelated. Chris, I don't like that language. Well, I don't like your cooking. Well, I don't like having to literally empty the farts out of your pockets whenever I do your laundry. You're the one who's always cookin' Brussels sprouts and broccoli. It's like an Irish bar fight down there. You're from one town over, so I hate your guts. Why don't we ever get any good food?! Yeah, Bonnie gives Joe Wonder Bread. Well, then go live at Bonnie's house. Then I could finally sleep in and not have to answer your stupid questions at 5:00 a.m. My curiosity peaks in the morning! You eat all my Dannon yogurts! I don't see your name on 'em! You don't even like them! But you know I do, and you don't want me to have them! You know, I've never confronted you on it, but I've often thought the same thing, Peter. Yeah, that's exactly what he does! 'Cause he's a selfish, fat idiot! You shut up, all of yous! I didn't ask to be in this family! Ugh, I'll go get him. Peter? You come back here! I faked all my orgasms! Hey. What's goin' on? You know, that was, uh, that was pretty cool the way you finally stood up to everybody. I don't know, Brian. I mean, I, I meant every word of it, but you saw what happened. What do you mean? They all turned on each other like a pack of wolves. Well, so what? That's not your problem. Do you think it's possible that that this family can't survive without some sort of lightning rod to absorb all the dysfunction? Well, that's a that's a theory, I guess. I mean, it-- it's not ideal, but it's an important piece that maybe it's just my lot in life to provide. Maybe if I feel bad, they don't have to. Wow. You know, that's incredibly noble and mature, Meg. You know, I think you might be the strongest person in this house. You mean that, Brian? Absolutely. Mom? Dad? Dad? Go away! Dad, come out of there. No! I don't deserve no better than livin' with the shoes! Peter, there you are. You guys, I have something to say. You're right. It's all my fault. What? Mom, you're an amazing mother and all the things I said about you were out of anger, and I didn't mean any of them. Chris, you're an outstanding brother. What I said about you was more about me being a rotten sister. And Dad, I'm so sorry that I made you feel this way. You don't deserve it. None of you have done anything wrong. I took all my problems out on you guys, and that wasn't fair. Oh, so this was all about you, it wasn't about us. Yeah. Alright, that makes sense. See, I thought it was weird that I was a bad dad. Meg, how could you put us all through that? I'm sorry, you guys. You're a (bleep) bitch! Yes. Yes, I am. Hi, I'm Stewie Griffin. Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use. But the simple fact is, it's no laughing matter. To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs. Good night."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Good morning! Is what normal families say. Lois, I'll take my breakfast to go. I'm going fishing with the fellas. Peter, I thought we were going to have some family time this weekend. You're going fishing again? Yes, Lois. I love fishing. Remember, fishing was my not-at-all-memorable job for two years? - No. You don't remember my fishing boat? You don't remember Santos and Pasqual? Not even a little. They were like male Consuelas. It was a mistake making 'em Portuguese, though. People don't even know what a Portuguese is. (chairs creaking) That's what I thought a Portuguese was. Me and my brain, huh? And we're just getting started! (birds squeaking, foghorn blowing) Boy, it's not like Quagmire to be this late. Yeah. Jeez, I've never tried to make conversation with just Joe before. This is brutal. Come on, Joe, you're losing him. Think of something. This was your shot. Two thirds of the planet is water. Yeah. Two thirds of the planet is water? This guy's okay. All right, well, um, we should probably go find out what's keeping Quagmire. Yeah, I guess you're right. And you know, Joe, uh, I was thinking. Maybe one night we get dinner, just the two of us. I would like that. (knocking) PETER: Hey, Quagmire? You in there? (gasps) Holy crap! Oh, my God! He must have autoerotically asphyxiated himself! Yeah, while he was watching clown porn. Oh, yeah, baby. Oh yeah, baby! You make me so horny! (bicycle horn blowing) Come on, help me get him down! Peter, he's still alive! We got to get him to a hospital! All right, but let's just watch the end of this clown porn first. (calliope music playing) Oh, Peter, we came as soon as we heard. How is he? He's in a coma, Lois. My God, what the hell happened? He hung himself during autoerotic asphyxiation. Just goes to show anything can be dangerous. Is his family here? His sister Brenda is coming with her boyfriend, Jeff. Oh, my God, not that guy. Is she still with him? Isn't he the one that beats her? Yeah, but she's gotten a lot better. All right, on the way back, I get to pick the radio station, because that was awful. I know, yeah, it was, I'm sorry. Oh, God, I just I hope Glenn's okay. I'm so worried about him. Shut up and limp! We're in a handicapped spot, you slut! Well, Miss Quagmire, your brother Glenn is lucky to be alive. You know, we're all lucky to be alive on such a beautiful day. In fact, nurse-- all surgeries are outside today. You know, when we were kids, our mother used to sing a song when we were sad. Maybe that'll help now. Come on, Brenda, a stupid nursery rhyme isn't going to wake him up, especially the way you sing. (laughing) Right, man? Gyaaaa.  Glenn, don't die from autoerotic asphyxiation   Your friends want to go fishing with you  This song is from childhood?  Live to see tomorrow, October 31, 2011.  Where am I? What happened? Oh, Glenn! Oh, thank God you're all right! Hey, you touching my girl?! Relax, Jeff. That's her brother. Yeah, that's how it starts. Come on, Brenda, we got to get out of here. I need cigarettes and jeans. Oh, thanks, you guys, for all your help through this. Oh, Glenn, we're just so glad you're all right. And Jeff and I are happy to stay here with you for as long as you need. Fine, then you call my cousin Terry and tell him we're not going to be at his karate recital! Well, Jeff, he is my brother. Why do you always got to remind me I didn't finish high school? Well, listen, how about I make us all some dinner, huh? Come here! (clattering) You fat, ugly bitch! If today wasn't your birthday Jeff! Please, you're being What?! What am I being?! Crazy?! Unemployed?! Why don't you call the cops like you did on Christmas?! I-I-I didn't call them! They were called! Oh, now you're calling me a liar in front of this cat?! I got another cat. Aw, that yellow lab looks like it's dying. Peter, that's Gwyneth Paltrow. She's fine. Look, turn off the light. I just want to get to sleep and put this ugly night behind us. All that unpleasantness with Brenda and Jeff was more than I can handle. It's no big deal, Lois. We probably just caught 'em on an off night. JEFF: Where do you get off calling me a deadbeat in front of your brother?! BRENDA: No, Jeff, a-a-all I said was that you were in between jobs! JEFF: Well, it wouldn't matter if you'd just pick up that night shift at the prison! BRENDA: But then I'll be working a hundred hours a week. JEFF: So what?! I need money for motor oil and wallet chains! BRENDA: Okay, I'll ask about it Monday. Can I put my nightgown back on? JEFF: No, I'm not done drawing! (doorbell rings) Hey, Peter. Geez, Quagmire, you look terrible. Oh, I didn't get any sleep. Hi, Glenn. How are you? Not great, Lois. I'm stuck in the middle of some bad stuff with my sister. I know, it sounded like there was quite a ruckus going on over there last night. That Jeff seems like kind of a monster. Yeah, that guy's scary as an Iraq Lobster. (playing ""Rock Lobster"")  Death to America   And butter sauce   Don't boil me   I'm still alive   Iraq Lobster   Iraq Lobster.  I've tried talking to Brenda about leaving him, but I haven't gotten anywhere. I was actually hoping you could talk to her, Lois. She might open up more to you, you know, 'cause you're a woman. - Me? - Yeah, would you mind at least trying? Well, I guess she does need someone to talk to. Well, let's hope she's good at talking 'cause we know she doesn't listen so good. That we know. You know, Brenda, I'm glad we could get together. Me, too, Lois. It's nice to have a girlfriend to chat with. Don't you have any back home? Oh, no. Jeff would never allow that. You know, that's kind of what I want to talk to you about, Brenda. Do you mind taking off your sunglasses? Oh, my God. No, i-it's really not that bad. It only hurts when I see. You know, you don't have to stay with a man who treats you that way. Oh, Jeff's sweet. You don't see how soft and gentle he hits me when we're alone. Do you hear yourself? He shouldn't be hitting you at all. I don't think you understand how serious a matter Close your menu. What? Close your menu, so they know we're ready to order. I'll give you another moment. Damn it. I'm sorry. Oh, shoot. See, this is why Jeff corrects me all the time. Corrects you? Brenda, he's not correcting you, he's beating you! Well, I-I-I can see why you'd think that 'cause of the punches and all, but it's just that Jeff's been so angry about immigrants. What?! It'll be better when he gets back to work. Our relationship is just complicated, that's all. No, Brenda, it's not complicated. Trying to get a straight answer out of a 23-year-old girl is complicated. So, do you want to go out some time? Out like, go out or hang out or just do something? Like a date. Like a date date? Or like a date? Both, I I guess. Yeah, sure, maybe. I don't know. Yes, no. Here's the first three digits of my phone number. E-mail me. Joe, the guy's a menace. They've been with me three days now, and all he does is beat her day and night. And on top of that, they say they don't need to be entertained, but then they're always like, ""Hey, so what're we doing? What's next?"" Hey, Joe, can't you can't you just arrest the guy? I can't arrest Jeff unless Brenda files a formal complaint with the police. She won't go to the police. She's afraid of what Jeff will do. And to be honest, I don't blame her. I mean, w-w-what happens if one of these nights, he hits her so hard he kills her? Sorry, Quagmire. Police policy, we can't step in until it's too late. But if I were you, I'd set up an intervention. What's that? It's like a surprise birthday party, but instead of cake and presents, there's angry letters and someone who inappropriately tries to make it about themselves. Aw, that sounds great! I bet I would really shine at one of those. All right, well, first we want to thank you all for being here for Brenda. Now, I know it's going to be a long day, but we're all here because we care about her very much. What the what's going on? What's all this? Brenda, this is an intervention. A lot of us don't like how Jeff's been treating you. So we're going to say a few things, and then you'll say a few things, and then we'll be done. Sound good? Um I guess. All right, so we're going to go around the room and tell you exactly how your situation has affected each of us. Meg? I feel like if he likes you, maybe you can change him. Okay, maybe she wasn't the one to start with. Caleb? Caleb, you want to go ahead? M M me? Yeah, go ahead. Uh It's Chris. Y-You don't know my name? All right, this isn't off to a flying start. Peter, why don't you go ahead? So, you like getting beaten, huh? Well, why don't you smoke a whole carton of cigarettes! Look, I know what you guys are trying to do, but Jeff and I are fine. No, Brenda, you're not fine, okay? Please, I'd like to say something, if I may. (clearing throat) ""Brenda, the fact that you are being abused ""has affected my life in the following ways: ""The sister that I knew and loved growing up ""no longer exists. ""The person I see before me now is just a punching bag. ""And I call you 'person' and not 'woman' ""because a woman is a strong, beautiful, vibrant creature. ""A woman embraces life. ""A woman makes choices to make her life better. ""Sadly, the fact that you are with Jeff, proves to me that you have made a choice to make your life worse."" I-I want the girl I grew up with back. I want I want my sister back. Brenda, I love you. Please make the right decision. Which is a perfect time for me to tell my jokes. Peter! And I will save them for the end. Glenn, I am so lucky to have such a wonderful, loving brother like you. So, are you gonna leave him? Oh, there you are! Hey, give me some money! I saw a cool bandana. What the hell's going on here?! Listen here, you bully! For your information, Brenda just agreed to leave you! Like hell she did. Brenda, you tell 'em? No, not yet. Everyone I have wonderful news. Jeff and I are getting married. (all gasp) I'd show you the ring, but it's under the splint. My finger fell down the stairs. You're getting married?! Yeah, but only 'cause she's pregnant. Pregnant?! Oh, congratulations! Have you thought of any names yet? Maybe maybe ""Slappy""? Or-or ""Bruisey""? Or ""Keep-It-Down- In-There-sy""? Guys, what the hell am I gonna do? She can't marry that bastard. He's just gonna keep beatin' her, and then he's gonna beat the kid, too! God, I wish she'd never met Jeffrey Fecalman. You know, I was thinking Wait, what? What? That's his name? Yeah. Huh-larious. But you know, I was thinking this afternoon, what the hell happened to the days when a guy does something like that to a girl, and a bunch of us guys get together and just go kick his (bleep) ass? Boy, that'd be satisfying. Well why not? What do you mean? The three of us. We go over there and we do what's right; we kill the bastard. Whoa, whoa, Quagmire. You know, I could arrest you just for saying that. You know what else you can get arrested for? Soliciting a rooster. I don't know what this cock-a-doodle-doo thing is, but it sounds gay and it sounds scatological. I'm in. You're about to have a neat day. Quagmire, you're talking about murdering a guy. It doesn't matter what he's done, it's still murder. No, Joe, it does matter what he's done! These kinds of guys don't change. Y-you think they ever suddenly wake up and realize the error of their ways and clean up their act? No! They just keep ruining everyone's lives, and the world is better off without 'em. It's against the law, Quagmire, and that's the end of it. (loud slap, Brenda screams) JEFF: What the hell?! Did you change the channel while I was going to get a beer?! Oh, yeah, I-I'm sorry, honey, I just wanted to see who was on Letterman. We're watching Leno, you bitch! I'm so sorry! His soft, gentle humor connects effortlessly with my mainstream sensibilities! (slaps) (screams) Let's waste this dick. Boy, everything's different now than it used to be, isn't it? You know, this morning I had a bowl of Fruity Pebbles cereal. Yeah, yeah. When I was a kid, they were boulders! (laughs loudly) (laughs) Cereals do change. Oh, no, no. Here's something, here's something. Did you hear about this? Here's a bunch of words in a row: because the economy's so bad, they've decided they're gonna shut down all the prisons. Yeah, yeah. And-and they're gonna send all the inmates to Congress. I don't get that one! Hi, there, Jeff. Hey, what's going on, dudes? Brenda just fell. Get your lazy ass up and get my neighbors some beers! Actually, we don't have time, Jeff. We were just about to go on our annual midnight hunting trip. We thought you might want to join us. Yeah, what the hell. Go shoot some animals, that sounds like fun. Hey, it beats sitting at home watching Meg pop her zits. (squish) Okay, okay, who would you rather do? Dame Judi Dench with 30 minutes of kissing first or Eddie Izzard in drag, but he has a working vagina? Would Eddie Izzard tell others about it? Eddie Izzard is very discreet. Then that's your answer. You know, Quagmire, I gotta say, I was pretty surprised you wanted me to come along. I thought you hated my guts. (chuckles) Oh, come on, Jeff, I don't hate your (bleep) guts. Well, then what the hell are we doing out here? I thought we were gonna kill Ah! So, Jeff, do you like loud sentences?! I guess. I gotta take a whiz. All right, look, when he comes back, I'm just gonna do it, okay? I'm just gonna point my gun straight at his head before he even knows what's going on. (shotgun racks) Kinda like this? You know, Quagmire, you are pathetic. You have to bring your friends out here with you to do your dirty work? What what do you mean, Jeff? You're gonna kill me, is that it? Uh-uh! Not unless you want your friend's brains all over the place! Listen, Jeff, just put the gun down and we'll forget this whole thing, okay? Oh. Well, that's never happened before. Kinda don't know what to do next. So now you'll forget the whole thing? Yeah, I, uh, guess that is what I said. No, no, we can't forget the whole thing! Yeah, you know, he's right. We can't forget it. Fine. Now here's the plan: I'm taking Quagmire for a little ride, and you guys are gonna stay out here and freeze to death! Now, get those hands where I can see 'em! All the way up! Oh, my shirt's a little too short. That's okay. You can keep 'em the way you had 'em so it covers your stomach. Thank you. You know, if this Jeff was around more, we wouldn't have tried to kill you. See you later, schmucks! All right, this is far enough. Well, Quagmire, sorry it had to end this way; a tragic hunting accident. I guess that little baby's gonna grow up without an uncle. Actually, I have a brother. Gary Quagmire. Oh. I think I think you got a brother, too, don't you? All right, forget the uncle thing! Get ready to die, Quagmire. You know, if you had any balls, you'd put that gun down and we could settle this like men. (laughs) That's awful big talk for a scrawny bastard like you. Hey, I'm serious, man. Unless you're scared I can take you. Suit yourself, man. Just means you're gonna die slower. (spits) (bones crack) (gasping) (groans) (engine starts) (engine revs) What the hell?! I killed you! I choke myself every day, you bastard! (tires squeal) (radiator hissing) (sobbing) Oh, oh, Glenn, there you are. Jeff didn't come home last night and he hasn't called. Uh, well, actually, about that, Brenda, he must've left early this morning. Yeah, we found this note he left you. ""Dear Brenda, I have decided to leave you. ""I realized that you are too good for me, ""and you and our unborn child would be better off ""without me in the picture. Love, Jeff. ""P.S. If the cops ask, tell them ""that Joe, Peter and Quagmire were with you last night. ""If you tell anyone otherwise, ""I will come back and not only hit you, but I will murder you. ""And no one will care because you're garbage. And your baby is going to be a child of garbage."" (hushed): It's a little rough, Peter. I didn't write it. Joe did. I wanted it to sound real. It's gotta sound like he wrote it. Plus, she kinda is garbage, Quagmire. ""Well, I best be rolling on now."" (hushed): Oh, come on! Who says that?! (hushed): It's an expression. Yeah, if you're in a wheelchair. Listen, you had your chance. I e-mailed it to both of you. You wrote back: ""Looks fine."" And you just added that part about Grape Ape. ""P.P.S. I really love Grape Ape. The end."" (sighs) Wow. I guess he's really gone. (sobbing) I kinda want to kill somebody else now. Ooh, Mort!"

Oh, sorry, I- I meet so many people. But there's really no way you could know that. Yeah, she's a housewife, she don't know. Whatever. You got booze in here?

Hey, hey, so what's all this about, everyone in Quahog likes to tickle fight? What is that? What? I never heard that. Yeah, apparently it's, like, a thing. It is? Yeah. I mean, they also said that people who pretend not to have heard of it are chicken. Well, I ain't no chicken. One-nothing! No, two-nothing! Three-nothing! Fight over! Fight over! Wow, you got a lot of catching up to do, and tomorrow night in the dark, huh? In the dark? Yeah, if you say so. Just don't tickle me in my lower abdomen. I'm super ticklish there. Lower abdomen.

Blah. Nervous. You know, Ryan, most people take one look at me and just assume that I have plans, so I never get asked out. But I-I frequently don't have plans, so yes, I would love to do something with you on Thursday night. Yes! Oh, my God, right now would be the worst time for you to tickle my lower abdomen, because it's so exposed 'cause I'm cheering. Yeah, Thursday night! Aw, your big mouth just got you in trouble. Aw, I lose. Peter one, you zero. Oh, I lose again. Peter two, you zero. You've been practicing. We now return to the end of a depressing 1970s sci-fi movie starring a guy in a turtleneck. We've gone far enough. I think we're safe from The Corporation here. Adzin, ook! It can't be. No! We'll never defeat The Corporation! They've won! There is one way, Adzin. You can shoot yourself. If it's the only way, I must. What the hell?! Stewie, get out here! Look at this. Do you know anything about this? A- About what? About what a beautiful day it Oh, my God, that is surprising. Oh, I had to stop that last sentence in the middle because I was so surprised. What happened? Gee, I don't know. Do you know what happened? I'm sorry, w-what was that? I- I was laughing at that funny thing you said at dinner the other night. What funny thing? Um, y-you remember what you said about Lois's, um, ""patoes au rotten""? Huh. Didn't ink anybody heard that. Wish you'd laughed at the time. W- What the hell happened to my car?! Well, I don't know, man, but the good news is, it-it doesn't look all that bad, Brian. It's just, it's that spot right there that's upsetting you, right? Stewie, I know it was you. Your potato joke was terrible. I can't believe you drove my car! You could have gotten yourself killed! I'm gonna have to tell Peter and Lois. No! No, you can't tell them! I'll be in so much trouble! Stewie, I have to. All right, I have covered for you plenty of times before, but not this time. This is very dangerous, and have to make sure you never do it again. I won't, I swear! Stewie, calm down. Sometimes in life you just have to accept what's coming to you. Like the contestant who gets the lesser showcase on The Price is Right. Lindsay, your showcase is all about relaxation. And what better place to relax than in your brand-new hammock?! This sturdy and portable hammock from Swingway turns any patio into a tropical paradise. And you can entertain yourself on your patio by drawing with chalk! Yes, Pratt and Millwood eight-color pastel chalk will turn your patio into a tropical art studio. But you'll have to pack your chalk because you're going to be staying six days and seven nights at your parents' house in Wilmington, Delaware! I moved my abortion for this.   Um, hey, thanks for taking me out to dinner, Ryan, but I got to say, this food looks a little weird. Aw, Peter, Moroccan food is the jizz. I don't know. Looks like it might give me the kind of farts I get from eating Mexican food. Con cuidado es el stinko! Hey, do these pants look all right? Sometimes I put them on, and I'm thinking I look all balls. No, I think you're good. You think my balls are good? You're so weird. It's awesome, though. Oh, I I don't know. Hey, have you noticed what a jerk the mailman is in this town? Like, he said there is no way Peter Griffin could crush a baby bird with his bare foot while I watched. That guy talks more crap about me. Mmm! Oh! Mmm. You got to taste this lamb tagine. Mmm. Here. No, that no, that's okay. Come on, you'll love it. Eh Just a taste. That was intense. What you just did. Lots of Lots of flavors. Whoops. Whoa, freeze frame! What's gonna happen next? I think I got to go to the bathroom. What am I gonna do? I'm gonna be in so much trouble when they find out I wrecked Brian's car! They'll probably ship me off to Siberia. This sucks. I hate it here. Shut up. Drink wolf milk and watch Russian cartoons. MAN WITH RUSSIAN ACCENT: We now return to popular Russian cartoon, Shoe and Shoelace. Shoe and Shoelace! One is meaningless without the other! Well, that's it. I have nchoice. I've got to run away. Guess I'm on my own now, Rupert. It could be worse, though. At least I'm not getting stabbed by some random guy on the street. See? It's the exact opposite. Oh! It happened anyway! Hey, Stewie, you up? What the Brian, I've decided to run away. Don't come looking for me. And definitely don't chase me to the airport and catch me at the gate just before I'm about to get on the plane with, like, an emotional speech and possibly flowers. For example, it would be awful if all the TSA people were gathered around, watching this emotional moment, even the older black female carry-on scanner who initially stopped you at the baggage check, but who after you told her of your intentions, said, ""Go get him, child,"" in flagrant disregard of all newly-implemented post-9-11 security measures. And if you were considerin bringing a boom box to play music, I would suggest any one of these six songs. So again, ran away. Don't come after me.  I want to thank you  Dirty whores, all of you. Oh, hey, Peter. Lois, we got a problem. I think Ryan Reynolds is in love with me. What? Don't be ridiculous. It's true. Last night we were at this restaurant, and he tried to gay kiss me. I'm telling you, he wants to get with me. Peter, come on. Why would any man dress well, groom himself and lift weights just to sleep with other men? He's not gay. Well, I don't care what you say. He likes me. And we do have chemistry, I- I won't deny that. I- I I will take responsibility fomy part in this. I'm just gonna go over there and let him down easy. Oh, Snooki died. Last stop. What? This isn't the airport. Oh, my God, Rupert! We've got to get out of here! Aah! Damn it! Oh, no, no. Baby fall down! Is that? Is that Consuela? Baby all alone in street. I take baby home. It's me. Stewie. Don't you remember? You used to clean for us. We used to make you use the bathroom at the gas station. Hey, you! Uh, hey, Ryan. Uh, bad time? Um, perfect time. Come on in. I was just oiling my legs. So, hey, what's on for tonight? You know, my dentist leaves his office unlocked. I was thinking we could do some nitrous and then have dinner in there. Look, Ryan, you're a great guy and everything, but I don't like you in that way. I mean, there are some things that I would do with you, but my heart wouldn't be in it. What are you talking about? That you like me, and you want to be my boyfriend. You think I'm gay? Where did you get that? Uh, uh, you-you tried to kiss me. Peter, I'm not gay. What the hell's the matter with you? Look, look, look, let me let me put it to you this way. I'm attracted to you in the way that a man is attracted to a woman, but I'm not gay. When you live out in Hollywood, you learn that life is about different spirits and energies you meet along the way. I just thought maybe our spirits could intertwine, you know? Ouenergies could merge. Like my spirit could go up inside your energy. I- I have so much to learn about show business. But you know what? I could never really be attracted to somebody who uses labels like ""gay"" and ""straight."" Maybe you should just go. Well-Well, now, wait a second. What do you mean? This isn't working. It was a nice thought, but I think we should go our separate ways. No, Ryan. I get it now. I can be what you want. We could Peter. Don't embarrasyourself. You need to just let this go. Tickle fight! Tickle fight! No, Peter, no! Tickle fight! Tickle fight! Tickle fight Peter, no! No! Oh, my God It's time for you to leave. I can change. I can change. I'm sorry, Peter. We're done. We can never talk again. Here's a cell phone so we can always talk. Don't you guys have any tub toys? Here. Is rattle. This is prescription medication. And it's not even your name on the label. What What is this? What's in this tub? Is jicama. Jicama? And what is? What? What? This is a chicken leg. Are you also making soup? For quinceaÃ±era. Big party. Many peoples. Oh, my God. Hay un perro aqui. Â¿Doggy es aqui? I bet even you guys don't watch George Lopez. Consuela? Hey, it's Brian. I'm-I'm looking for Stewie. No, no baby aqui. I peed in your soup. Happy 15th birthday. Which, by the way, is not a special occasion in the normal world. Stewie, I've been worried sick. What the hell are you doing here? Brian? How did you find me? I used my nose, which I always forget about. Come on, let's go. No, I'm not going back! I can't! They're gonna be mad at me! I didn't tell anyone. You you didn't? No, I didn't. Look, I thought about it, and to be honest, it's probably my fault for leaving you alone in the car. And if you promise never to do it again, I won't say anything. Okay, I promise. My baby! What? I say, let go of me. Consuela, we're leaving. My baby! Hey, she says it's her baby, man. Now, get out of here. Is my baby. Ernesto. No, I'm not I'm not Ernest Okay, this is so messed up right now. I did not want to have to do that. They were very nice to me up until then. Peter, stop staring outhe window. Ryan's gone. He finished his movie, he's moved out. How could I have been so blind? How could I not have seen what he offered? I think the whole thing was very strange. He thought you were strange! How about that? Whatever. I just can't help but wonder will I ever see him again?"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Oh, hey, there you are. Hey, listen, I got something really cool I want you to see. What is it? This. I found it in the yard. A tennis ball. That's very impressive, Brian. Yeah, but don't tell the other dogs in the neighborhood. They'll be jealous. You son of a bitch. And this is nothing. There's one tennis ball out there that's even cooler 'cause I peed on it. Buried it years ago. I just can't remember where. I'd give anything to find it, though. Well, if you could recall exactly when you buried it, I suppose I could help you out. I remember the exact day. January 31, 1999. Very well, follow me, Brian. Watch out for Ernie. He's getting a CAT scan. Well, here we are. That's odd. It's our house, but somehow it looks a little different. Mom, my lips are too thin. Can I please get collagen injections? Meg, you don't need to change the way you look. You know, most of the world's problems stem from poor self-image. Oh, my God, what's with Meg's voice? She sounds like someone who's about to give up a huge opportunity. That's nothing. Look at you. You look like a prize at some Mexican church carnival. Excellent. The mind control device is nearing completion. Stewie, I said no toys at the table. Damn you, vile woman! You've impeded my work since the day I escaped from your wretched womb. Oh, don't pout, honey. You know, when you were born, the doctor said you were the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen. But of course. That was my victory day. The fruition of my deeply-laid plans to escape from that cursed ovarian bastille. Return the device, woman! Geez. What, did you carry a thesaurus around with you? You know, it's amazing I could speak at all with that circumcision still healing. Hey, wait a minute, Stewie. That's the spot! That's where I buried my tennis ball! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Brian, what are you doing? You can't dig it up here. Just make a mental note of where you buried it, and as soon as we're back in the present, you can dig it up then. - Why? - Because we can't risk doing anything that alters the past. You know, I never got that. I mean, w-wouldn't you want to alter the past? I mean, you could make life better for yourself. And not just for yourself, for everyone. You-You could stop 9/11. Brian, there's one rule of time travel, and that is: Do not alter the past in any way or the consequences could be dire. Yeah, where'd you hear that? Quantum Leap. That guy changed the past all the time! Whoa, ass ahoy. Hey, Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. What's the occasion? Ew, I remember this. Peter's eye did that weird creepy thing where it went over his nose. Come on, you're worrying about nothing. Oh? Remember when you got drunk off the communion wine at church? Ah! Ew! Gross! Look at that. Wait, what are they doing? I don't know. They're just standing there like zombies. Do you think they're all right? I-I'm not sure. And then there was that time at the ice cream store. They're doing it again. What the hell? I-I'm at a loss. I mean, I know we're not supposed to mess with the timeline, but should we call an ambulance? That is so creepy. And remember you had an Irish coffee the day we went to see Philadelphia? Oh. They're do-- they're setting up (bleep) cutaways. Oh, my God, is that what we did back then? Yeah, I mean, now, we just like return text messages and screw around and whatnot. Lois, I'm not going back to work tomorrow. That new boss has it in for me. He's meaner than a shifty salesman. You sure you got time to smoke? Oh, yeah, it's an Al Harrington. It goes on for a while. All right, look, we found out where your ball is buried. Now let's get back to our own time. Okay, get the return pad. Let's go. Not out here in the open. Someone could see us. Remember? No altering the timeline? Come on, let's get up to my room. Hey, wait a minute, Stewie, I got to take a leak. Will it screw up the timeline if my future pee goes in a past toilet? Uh, no, as long as it goes in the toilet. One splash on a magazine in there, and we're getting chased by dinosaurs. Huh. Looks more or less the same. Oh, my God, my Japanese children's books. I forgot about these. You Poop Now. Horton Hears a Suicide. The Little Engine That Will, Or Get Great Shame. Oh, there you are. All right, come on, Brian. Let's get out of here. Blast, that draggle-tailed, blunt-edged, matriarchal despot! Who the deuce does she think she is?! Quick, Brian, hide! I shall cleverly disguise this lethal plasma disruptor device as a tuna fish sandwich, whereupon I shall end that wretched woman's Draconian reign of tyranny! Oh. Hey. Who the deuce are you? Uh, well, I'm, uh I'm you. You look like me, but that's utterly impossible. I'm afraid it's true. I'm you from the future. I've traveled back in time. That's absurd. Look, I can prove to you that I'm you from the future. I know about the Eddie Bauer catalog. It is you! Okay, bye, Lois. I'm going to the stag party. Brian, you might as well come out now. He knows everything. Uh-oh. Brian, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Where'd you get that? The Stewie from the past has a lot more gadgets and things than I do. I've kind of slacked off a little bit. How's the party? Looks like fun. Hey, who wants to play ""Drink the Beer""? Right here. - You win! - All right! - What do I win? - Another beer! Okay, take a last look, 'cause we're out of here. Oh, look at that. There's the old gang we've gotten to know so well over the years. TV's not even plugged in. What is this? Where the hell are we? The air is electric here at Super Bowl 33 tonight. - Stewie, what's going on? - I don't know. For some reason, the time machine didn't take us back to the present. We're still in 1999. Wait a minute. I remember this. I think I'm up in that blimp. Amazing. You can barely drive a car, and yet you were allowed to fly a blimp? Yeah, America's great, isn't it? 'Cept for the South. Oh, no wonder the return pad didn't take us all the way. The batteries are almost depleted. Are those D batteries? Yes, ever since we had that trouble in Germany, I found a way to convert it so it takes D batteries instead of uranium. Only problem is, I didn't bring any cash with me. Did you? I don't think that's gonna be a problem. Oh, my God! Quick, grab some money! Do you, do you have pockets? Are you putting that in pockets? That's so cute. The crowd is storming the field! This is pandemonium! Quick, Brian, get on! Whoa, crash ahoy. Oh, God! Now where are we? Well, you know, I figured the sooner I cashed the check, the sooner they'd, uh, catch their mistake. Look, why are we making a federal case out of this? Oh, man, this is the day Peter went to court for his welfare fraud. Hey. Huh? Oh, hey. You're the Kool-Aid Guy. Yeah. What are you doing? Just waiting. For what? I'm just waiting, dude-- relax. Hey, is there any place around here that sells batteries? Guys, d-don't distract me, all right? I gotta really be up. Mr. Griffin, I think your words have touched us all. I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no! Oh, no! So there's no organs or glands or anything, right? It's just the liquid? Yeah. Yeah, it's just the liquid. Um, I don't know if this is a weird question, but can I have some? All right, fine. Tilt your head back, and I'll lean my liquid down into your mouth. Oh, now I don't want it. Oh, crap! Did I miss it?! Look, my husband may be a bit thoughtless at times; he may even be downright, well, stupid, but I know he only accepted that money because he Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Yeah! You guys did this! You guys (bleep) did this! Talking about my guts?! me up?! you! Okay, this is good. We got the D batteries. Let's get back to the present. All right, get on. We made it. Yeah, the Super Bowl was cool, but frankly, no Tommy Brady, no Stewie likey. Brian, there you are! Come quick, they're about to announce the unveiling of your statue on the news. Statue?! For what? What do you think, Mr. National Hero? For stopping the 9/11 terrorist attacks and saving our country. Oh, you-- I can't even express how mad I am at you right now. If it wasn't for you, those planes would've hit the World Trade Center. Brian, what the hell did you do?! I, uh, may have told my former self about 9/11. What did I tell you about altering the past?! Wait-Wait, when did you even do that? Well, you remember when I said I was going to take a leak? Brian, you shouldn't have done that. Who knows what unforeseen consequences are awaiting us. Saddam Hussein could be president. Mexico could be the world's dominant super power. Cookie Monster could have invented Facebook! What is this? Cookiebook. Brian! Hurry, it's starting! Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker. And I'm Joyce Kinney. Our top story: Quahog prepares to unveil a new statue commemorating perhaps its greatest hero ever. That's right, Tom. It was ten years ago that an almost inconceivable plot to destroy the World Trade Center was thwarted by Quahog's own Brian Griffin. This amateur video captured Griffin's heroism in the face of a shadowy terrorist organization called-- holy (bleep), look at all those vowels-- Al Qua-aye-eeda. Here. Make sure you get all this. Time to terrorize the terrorists. Ugh. You prepared catch phrases for yourself? No. Not necessarily. Mohammed Atta stayed home. Nobody knows that guy's name yet. You're using information that nobody knows. Houston, we have a solution. Houston's for space, not everyday air travel. Tell them to ground every plane out of the East Coast. Seacrest out. Wow. What a hero. Coming up next in sports: Arizona Cardinal Pat Tillman tackled by his own team? Oh, Brian, we're so proud of you. Yeah, buddy. Great job stopping those terrorists. And thank God their follow-up attack on St. Louis was a bust. We missed! Brian, I promise you, all of this can only end badly. Stewie, it's fine. I prevented 9/11. How could that possibly be a bad thing? I mean, come on, I-I saved, like, 200 lives. Wow! 3,000?! Oh, you knew what you were doing there. This major breaking news just in. Nine Southern states have declared that they are seceding from the United States. The announcement came from former President George W. Bush, who reformed the Confederacy after a bitter loss in his 2004 reelection bid. Bush lost in 2004? Yeah, he probably couldn't exploit people's fears with no 9/11. Bush appeared before the press today to make this brief statement. If anyone out there can get their hands on a clown's suitcase, I'd very much like to see what's inside of there. I think we have the wrong clip. What? No? It this? Uh, okay, that was George W. Bush declaring civil war on the Northern states. Oh, my God! Civil war? See, Brian? This is exactly what I was talking about. Look, Stewie, this doesn't necessarily mean things are going to turn out badly. In fact, I bet, five years from now, the world will still be better off for what I did. Is that so? Well, Brian, if you're that sure of yourself, then let's go five years into the future, and you can prove me wrong. Fine. Wow. This is the future? Everything looks slicker. Hey, Lois, I found some double-sided tape. I think I can do about seven minutes worth of funny stuff with it. That should get us to the Meg kissing booth story. Wow. Things have gotten kind of lazy, huh? Hey, Peter. Thanks for letting me borrow your screwdriver set. You know, I just want to say how nice it is to be back here with y'all on Spooner Street. Oh, I guess things didn't work out in Virginia. Chris, I heard you got a ""D"" on your report card. Here's a cutaway. Matthew McConaughey is terrible. Good Lord! What's happened to us? Okay, maybe things seem a little off, but other than that, the world seems okay. Which proves my point. Me stopping 9/11 led to a world that's just fine. Well, I'll see y'all tomorrow. Brian, you might want to look outside. Oh, my God! Oh, oh! Pebble in my shoe! Pebble in my shoe. Pebble in my shoe. Nice work, Bri. Whoops. Well, at least Joe gets to be a cyborg. Freeze, Frogmire. You are out past curfew, and therefore, in violation of local ordinance. Ribbity. What the hell happened? Could I really have caused all this? It says here that the new American civil war you set into motion ended up in a series of concentrated nuclear strikes all along the Eastern Seaboard. It killed 17 million people. Oh. - Including Cesar Millan. - No! Okay, okay, I get it-- Stewie, I screwed up. All right? I shouldn't have altered the past. Is there anything we can do? Well, the only way to fix this is to return to the moment when we first arrived in the past and stop you from spilling the beans about 9/11. Okay. Okay, let's do it. Whoa, ass ahoy. All right, look, there we are. Hey, uh, Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. What's the occasion? Stop! Both of you! What the hell? Who are you? We're you, from the future. Oh, boy, this can't be good news. Who screwed up? Take a wild guess. - What did I do? - Well, nothing yet, but listen. Whatever you do, you cannot tell your former self-- that Brian-- about 9/11. If you do, America as you know it will cease to exist. My God, Brian. What the hell? We've been here two minutes, and already you've destroyed America. Okay, okay. I promise I won't say anything. Also, if you don't give that Stewie a back rub, it really messes everything up. All right, can we go now? Did that do it? Did we restore the past? Well, let's check. ""9/11."" Oh, there it is. We did it, Brian. We made 9/11 happen. High five! All right! All right! Yeah! High five! Wow, that that probably wouldn't look very good out of context. There's the writer of the Harry Potter series. Must be weird hanging out with us Muggles, huh, Brian? Yeah. Well, laundrium insertum. Huh? Oh, my God. All right, you obviously have no self-control, so we've got to go back and do this again. Whoa, ass ahoy. All right, let's go. Hey, uh, Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got your pants on. Oh, yeah, that's right. We were just here. Wait! Who the devil are you? We're from the future. So are we. We're from the further future. We came to stop you. Why? What they did actually turns out to be damage-free. It's what you're about to do-- stopping them-- that causes utter bedlam. Oh, come on. Wait! Stop! We're from the further further future. What you guys do eventually works out. It's what you two are about to do that ruins everything! Stop! Don't do anything! Oh, for God's sake. We're from the further further further future. What these two do is fine. It's what you two do that makes things worse. - Stop! - Wait! - Hold it! - Stop! - Wait! - No! Hold it! Stop! I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm just looking for the can. - Don't move! - Hold it! - Freeze! - Stop! - Wait! - No! Oh, for God's sake, why? This is why! - Don't move! - Hold it! - Freeze! - Stop! - No! - Wait! Oh, my God. What's that? I don't know what happened. This is life for some reason. Don't do whatever you're about to do. God help us. This is no way to live. No, don't do it! Halt! All right, everybody, shut the hell up! All right, this is (bleep), all right? I can't follow what's going on anymore, and I'm assuming the rest of you can't, either. So let's make this easy and take a vote. How many think we should prevent 9/11? Raise your hands. One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine Okay, all right, looks like 42. All right, who votes ""yes 9/11?"" Okay, all right, 57. All right, 9/11 wins. Wait, wait, shouldn't it be an even number? Why is the total an odd number? Oh, yeah, I think one of the Brians died. What? What do you mean? I don't know-- one of them landed here with its throat slit. But wait, if one of me is dead, then shouldn't all the me's be dead? Brian, I-I don't I it's I don't I don't know anymore. I-I You know what? I guess not. A-All right? Okay, listen up-- everybody, get back in your individual time machines very carefully. Nobody touch anything. No Harry Potter novels. Don't step on a bug. Don't give earlier yous investment advice. Just go back to where you came from, and stay there! There. Now, we're going to do what we should have done in the first place. Get on. Wait a minute. Isn't this where we just were? Where are the other two us's? They're not here yet. Just to make sure there are absolutely no loose ends, I've sent us back in time to the moment just before you and I originally arrived. Why? You'll see. Get the (bleep) back in your time machine! Aah! Who are you? Never mind who I am! Just get back in your time machine, get back to the present, and stay there! Look, just calm down. Aah! You gonna flap your lips or you gonna do what I said? Okay, okay! All right! God! You just talked to yourself. Won't that alter the past? Don't worry, Brian. If I was successful in restoring the past just now, you and I will never have existed. The chronological tangent that created us will have been erased. Oh. Is it going to hurt? Just a little. Ow. Oh, God, my leg is killing me. Well, time travel is risky. Every time you step into that machine, you invite the possibility of altering the world as we know it. Thankfully, the alternate versions of us were there to prevent us from doing whatever it is we apparently did. I wonder what it was. We'll never know. But look on the bright side. You might be sitting here with a hole in your leg, but at least our present universe hasn't been affected. Sorry, guys. I'm gonna need the couch. The gang and I are gonna watch the game. All right, let's unplug the TV and get going."

Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  And we're back with our coverage of the Quahog Thanksgiving Day Parade. Happy Turkey Day, Quahog. This is Tom Tucker and Joyce Kinney live at the parade. We've got some on-and-off drizzle here today, and we're a little w, as you can see, because, apparently, there are no awnings that exist anywhere. There's your top news story right there. Mysterious awning shortage ravages the Northeast, but miraculously has not affected Channels 2 or 6. No no. Keep the camera over there. I want everyone to see it. This is why we're third. And here comes our first float of the day, Tom. It's the James Woods High football team with their ""Not Gay Revue.""  We just won the big game   We just won the big game   We drilled 'em and banged 'em   And plowed 'em a lot   And though that sounds suggestive   Let me stress that it's not.  And here comes the Rocky and Bullwinkle float. Always a popular sight here at the par S-Somebody want to handle that? Does some-- does some-- Does somebody want to deal with that? The car alarm, ""what."" You're kidding. Well, viewers, to top it off, that's the Channel 5 news van you're hearing. Ph-Phil, Phil just open it-- unlock the doors. You don't have to put the key in the ignition. Well, open the driver's side first. Okay, well, I guess it's broken, then, and there's nothing we can do about it. Okay, happy Thanksgiving, Quahog. Here's a car alarm. All right, well, I guess we'll just Ahhh, there we go. Oh, that must be Joe and Bonnie. Now remember everyone, let's be cheerful, 'cause Thanksgivings are very hard for them. 'Cause Joe can't walk? No. 'Cause his bum doesn't open up to poo anymore, and a nurse has to go digging up there to get up after his stuff? Oh, my God! I know. That was told to me in confidence. No. Don't you remember, Peter? It was on Thanksgiving that their son Kevin got killed in Iraq. Look who's here! Happy Thanksgiving. Gobble gobble. You guys, thanks so much for having us over. Well, we're just glad we can have people over again now that that giant crab's gone. Hey, guys, how ya doin'? Come on in. No-no-no-no-no-no-no. No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no. Just go around it. He's not gonna hurt ya. Just go around it. No-no-no-no-no-no-no. No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no. No-no-no-no-no. All right, try just going under him. I think we should probably just go home. Maybe we'll do it another time. No-no-no-no-no. What the hell? Mom! Mom, it's me! Mom! Oh, yeah, it's a baby. It's a big balloon, baby, just like you're a baby. No, it's me! It's a balloon of me! Peter, come look at this. He sees a baby and knows that he's also a baby. So smart. Mama's smart little boy. Aah, check out Quagmire. It's been a year and a half, and he still looks uncomfortable around his dad. Well, it's a big adjustment. After all, his dad did have a sex-change operation. So, uh how-how are things, Dad? Oh, Glenn, I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be back here. This is gonna be a really special Thanksgiving. Happy Thanksgiving! We brought chicken wings. Oh, yum. I hope they're the kind with the bone removed. Hey, Aunt Carol. Hey, Uncle Adam.  La la la la la.  Don't mention last night's Project Runway. I've got it on TiVo. Happy Thanksgiving. I brought Marshmallow Peeps. Oh. Okay. I'm gonna need that Pyrex dish back. Okay. I'm gonna need it back now. Oh. I don't want anything else today to get as tense as that just got. Carol, it's so good to see you. You, too, Lois. God, that is one nice ass. Thank you. You're welcome. This is nice. This is very nice, the time that we're spending together right now. Easy, Joe. Sorry. Just making mental memories for when you're all inevitably dead, and I'm left alone. Geez. Quagmire, help me out with this. No, he's right. I mean, sometimes chicks die, and it's not anyone's fault. Okay, everyone, it's 2:30. Time for dinner. 'Cause on Thanksgiving, 2:30 is dinnertime for some reason. Oh, my. Lois, those sweet potatoes look delicious. That's the stuffing, Ma. Now put on your glasses before you run over another black guy. Oh, this looks fantastic. I can't wait to poop this out. Hey! Who's gonna get the Thanksgiving dump trophy this year? You are! Dad's gonna get it! Who else? Loving. Loving family. Well, dig in, everyone! Hello, Ida. Hello, Brian. How have you been? Very well, thank you. He threw up when he found out you were a monster. This food is so (bleep) good, Lois. Oh. Okay. Wow. Hey! Is there room at that table for one more? Oh, my God! Kevin Swanson! Son, you're alive! Aw, and I stayed up all night writing dead kid jokes. All right, you know what, I'm gonna do one anyway. Kevin, go back outside. Everybody pretend this didn't happen. Hey, Joe, what's your favorite preparation of a tomato? Is it son-died tomato? Is it son-died tomato? Okay, Kevin, you can come back in. Welcome home, soldier. Son-died tomato. Kevin, you're alive! I don't believe it. Oh, my God, it's a miracle! Well, I guess you replaced real butter as the star of the dinner. But I don't understand. The Army said you'd been killed in action. What happened? Well, it's quite a story. In some ways, Army life in Iraq is what you'd expect, what with the blistering heat, the constant sense of impending danger, and the one gay soldier awkwardly avoiding the use of pronouns. Man, I sure miss my sweetheart back home. I can't wait to get back to that person. Chow time, boys. Yes, sir, Sergeant Major General Captain! Ah, come on, boys, it's Thanksgiving. Call me Major General Captain. Now you eat up. I don't trust that turkey those Iraqis made. Ah, you're all wet, Swanson. I call the white meat. I call the dark meat. I call the cell phone duct-taped to the side! Noooooo! They're all dead, sir, except for Swanson. He's in a coma, but he's unlikely to recover. Okay, well, just send Swanson's parents a letter saying that he's dead, 'cause those are already printed. You know what? Send one to my parents, too. I spent five years in a Kuwait military hospital. I woke up from the coma last week, and I flew straight here. Kind of a Thanksgiving surprise. Hey, when you get sexually abused while you're in a coma, do you know it's happening and just can't do anything about it? Or do u not even know what's going on? I also am curious about that. Hey, Kevin, you know I put a yellow ribbon on my car for you guys? And-and a little thing that says ""I support the troops."" 'Cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for you guys. but I don't have any change on me right now. Well, all that matters is that my boy is home. Kevin, I want you to meet your little sister, Susie. Wow. Hey, little sis. I guess we got some catching up to do, huh? Hope you don't get scared when I scream and have night terrors. It's quite all right. I've seen worse. A human centipede. How ghastly. Your mother and I are very proud of you, Kevin. You're a war hero. I don't feel like a war hero. Only a war hero would say that. Hey, so what about the female soldiers over there? Were they able to contribute? Eh, you know, they did their best. What with their regular bleedings when they got shot, did they even know? Look, guys, I'm not a hero. And I don't want to be treated any different than before. Just that you would say that means we should treat you different. Come on, guys, let's give him all our best food. Okay, now you eat up, and then we're all gonna go out back and play some Thanksgiving touch football-- excuse me: war hero Thanksgiving touch football. Yeaaaaah! U.S.A.! I didn't even know there was a war. Okay, let's pick teams. I'll be a captain, and, uh, Mayor West, you can be a captain. All right. I pick you. You can't pick me; I'm a captain. No one had ever stood up to me like that before. I respected him from there on out. That's a great story, Grandpa. I didn't like it. None of my grandchildren had ever disliked one of my stories before. From then on, he was my favorite. Well, I don't like that story, Great Grandpa. Future old people are wizards. I'm I'm drunk, and I'm gonna throw the football too hard at my kids. Oh, Dad, do we have to-- Ow! Don't cry! Don't cry! Game's over if you cry. I want you to learn about life, Chris, 'cause of, in life it's like this. Peter, I think you may have had one too many. Maybe it's time to ease off, huh? What are you talking about, Lois? Dads getting drunk on Thanksgiving is a holiday tradition. I work hard to put a cornucopia on this table, and you're out showing your lower ankle to every Tom, Tom, and other Tom in our village! Don't talk to mother in like fashion! That's it. The belt is coming off. All right, son. Let's put these bozos in a hurt locker. Right? 'Cause, uh, ""hurt locker"" means some kind of war hero thing, or something. Pfft. My friends and I used to laugh about how fake that movie is. But Well, wait, I, uh I'm pretty sure that movie came out after you went into your coma. Right-- no, no, uh, I-I-I was talking about a different movie. Let's play ball! Yeah, let's play ball. The world has changed around me, and I'm mad and scared! Lois, this pumpkin pie looks delightful. Hey, Kevin, can I see your Purple Heart? 'Cause I never actually seen one. One-one time this homeless guy showed me his purple head, but looking back, I'm-I'm not so sure that that was really a military thing. Pfft. I didn't want that stupid medal. You know what I did with it? I threw it back over the White House fence. Wait a minute. I thought you said you flew straight home from Kuwait after you woke from your coma. When did you throw your medal over the White House fence? N-N-N-No, I-I-I told you, I flew to D.C., ditched the medals, and flew home. I guess that was just his dirty hobo penis, huh? Kevin, why would you want to get rid of your war medals like that? 'Cause it was a stupid war, you know? All it did was put me in a coma and kill one of my bunkmates and cripple the other one for life. W-Wait a minute. Now, I thought earlier you said that both of your bunkmates were killed. Now you're saying only one of them was? But I just want you guys to know I barely even stared at that penis for an hour. What? Come on, Dad. Whatev. H-Hey, why's it so hot in here? It's too hot in here. Wait a minute. An Ed Hardy T-shirt? That particular strain of douche bag didn't arise until 2007, while you were supposedly in your coma. Look, get off my case, Dad! What do you want from me? The truth. Fine! Here's the truth! I was never in any coma, okay? I bailed. I faked my death and went AWOL. I faked my own death once. No dentist appointment for this guy. So, there it is. I'm not a war hero. I abandoned my platoon. So now what do we do? Me? Am-Am I, am I supposed to say something? Kevin, you're under arrest for the crime of desertion. Oh, my. Um, maybe it's time for us girls to hit the powder room. You may use the yard. So you were lying to us this whole time? You weren't really injured in Iraq? First Pat Tillman lies about how he died and now you? Kevin, I don't understand. There's nothing to understand. Our son is a deserter. Come on, Kevin, I'm taking you to jail. Joe, wait! Not now, Bonnie. Joe, you can't! Bonnie, we'll discuss this later! Joe! You're not taking my son anywhere. Damn it, you guys are ruining Thanksgiving! And it's my second favorite holiday, right after Pretend Not To Notice People's Race Day. Hey, you seen Reggie around? Which one is Reggie? Oh, uh, today he's wearing yellow pants, uh, yellow shirt, yellow hat, yellow shoes. Uh, he's got a gold tooth, uh, diamond earring. Um, he's got that big necklace with the dollar sign on it. Uh, he's always grabbing his crotch when he's telling a story. Like the one about when he found out his mother is really his grandmother. Could you be more specific? Uh, oh, let's see. Uh, he always wears cheap cologne. Uh, drives a Mercury Cougar with a crown on the dashboard. Uh, never pays his alimony. Uh, he's extremely cut for a guy who never works out. Oh, there he is. Thanks anyway. Hey, Reggie! Look, maybe we should just let Kevin explain why he did what he did. At first, I believed in the cause. But then I saw what we were doing to the people of Iraq. Innocent people. There was one that I'll never forget. He was a little Iraqi street kid. I'd befriended him a few months earlier. Couldn't have been more than 12 years old. I taught him how to crack wise, American style. I guess that store's having a fire sale. I tell you, that kid was strong-headed for his age. Smart, but innocent. And then one day, there was a fire fight. We bring in this civilian who got killed in the crossfire. I pull back the sheet, and who is it? Not the kid, but, like, the kid's dad's, like, coworker's neighbor. He was 74 and he had actually tried to rape someone. But just looking down at his dead face and knowing that he lived near someone who worked with the dad of the kid whose name I never found out, I lost all hope. That's when I knew I had to get out of Iraq. I just had to wait for my chance. I call the white meat! I call the dark meat! I call the cell phone duct taped to the side! No! Somehow, I'd been spared that Thanksgiving. But I can't say the same for my bunkmates. There were bits and pieces of them everywhere. I knew the Army would never be able to identify who was who. So that was my chance to disappear. So I left. How could you do that?! Coward! Traitor! If you think that I'm gonna masturbate after this tonight, you're right. We don't have to sit here and listen to this. Come on, Kevin, let's get out of here. Nice try, skank. Worth a shot. Well, where did you go after you left the war? I spent a few years laying low. Wrote some poems. You want to hear some? No. Are you sure? They're pretty intense. No. Here, let me just read one. If I can guess a line in there, will you not read it? I don't think you'll be able to guess a line. Is it something like, ""Ice burns as hot as fire""? Okay, so then I went to Europe, Australia, Canada, all over. But I really missed you guys. I wanted to be with people who love me, no matter what. So I came home. Well, it sounds to me like you're a regular Benedict Arnold Drummond. W-What's he expecting us to cut to? I think he wants maybe-- I don't know-- Gary Coleman in a Napoleon hat? But we don't have that. We-We got to come up with something. Well, we got, uh, we got ""The Cowardly Lion is Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist."" Play it, play it. But he didn't set it up. Play it! All right, I'm gonna check her for diseases. There's just one thing I want you to do. What's that? What's that? Talk me out of it. No, no, no, no, no, no. What the hell is going on up there? Well, I'm sorry you all feel the way you do. But I walked away from an illegal war of aggression being fought 6,000 miles away from our shores. Better there than here where all my stuff is. So, what, you figured you'd just let 'em get away with 9/11? Mr. Griffin, Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11. And the war we started in Iraq has killed a half a million of their people, which is like 200 9/11's. So, I guess those moments of silence we had at those sporting events meant nothing to you. I'm just saying this war is wrong. Son, your job isn't to decide whether it's right or wrong. Your job is to follow orders. Well, that's what the Nazi soldiers did, isn't it? They followed orders. You're saying our troops are like the Nazis?! No, I'm just saying that blindly following orders has resulted in the deaths of millions of people throughout history. You know, I have not talked to Carol all night. Carol, how are you? Look, I think you guys are all rushing to judge Kevin without knowing what it was like to be in his shoes. He saw horrific things, in a horrific war, that only one other person here could possibly come close to understanding: Ida. She was in the military. She's seen battle. She's seen innocent people butchered by war machines. And I'm sure that Ida, more than anyone else here, can understand and support the choice that Kevin made. No, Brian, I do not understand Kevin's choice, and I do not support it. Okay, well, that's just some dumb drag queen. Son, when you go to war, you don't end up fighting for your country or your family or your flag. You're fighting for your fellow soldiers there in the foxhole with you. You walked out on those men, and that's what's most unforgivable. You know what, everyone? Forget it. Up till today, you guys thought I was dead. Well, I'm not. But after all this, Dad, you may as well take me to prison, 'cause right now I wish I was dead. If anyone has wanted whip cream on their pie, it's not my fault. I can't get a (bleep) word in edgewise around here. Kevin, I don't want to lose you again. But I do have a job to do. So get moving. 'Cause there's at least one Swanson man in this room who does his duty. Doodie means poop. It does. Are you, Dad? Are you the only one who does his duty? That's not how I remember it. What are you talking about? You don't remember, do you? I was in first grade. You took me out with you on one of yo shifts. I just think it's presumptuous. I mean, come on, ""the country's best yogurt""? You know, prove it. Show me your data. Help! Police! That man's a thief! Go get him, Dad! Reach for the sky, dirtbag! What the hell? I'm sorry, Officer. I-I was just trying to feed my family. I don't care what you were trying to do, you broke the law. I know. I didn't know what else to do. I have three very wide-eyed children to feed. Wide-eyed children are the hungriest. Kids, Daddy has to go away for a while, okay? Take care of Mommy until she dies tomorrow. It's okay, Daddy. I'll be the man of the shack while you're gone. Uh, listen, there's been a mistake. I'm not here to arrest your father. You're not? No, Son. I just came over to tell you what a great guy your father is and how hard he's been working for all of you. Wait. You're letting me go? I don't understand. I'm not sure I do either. I know the law says I have to arrest you. But sometimes the law is just a piece of paper. There's right, there's wrong, and somewhere in between, there's life. You folks have a good day. I never forgot what you did. Well, thanks for coming, you guys. You know what you were doing that day, Dad? You were breaking the law. You knew what your duty told you you were supposed to do, but instead, you did what you thought was right. I haven't thought about that family in years. I think about them all the time. And the example you set for me that day. It's the very reason I left Iraq. It sucks how early I have to work. Well, Kevin, I still can't say that I agree with your choice. Not one bit. But I suppose sometimes a man has to do what he thinks is right. And if that's what you thought was right, I guess I can accept it. I'm glad you're home, son. Me, too, Dad. You know, there's still some pumpkin pie left, everyone. That sounds good to me. Me, too. Hey, happy Thanksgiving to us all, huh? USA! USA! Wait! That man's an imposter. I'm the real Kevin Swanson! Guys, I don't think we have time for this."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  There it is, you guys. The best roller coaster in all of Quahog. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: The Ride. You know, I think they kind of figured that movie was going to turn out to be bigger than it was. Oh, come on Lois, it'll be awesome. It simulates all the fun of of, um w-what was it now? It was like a like a tall guy in a black hat and a cape or something? Yeah, yeah, and there was the guy with the mask who wore a mask. And one guy had an umbrella. Yeah, and I believe he opened it at one point. Yeah, and it wasn't overly long. Yeah, not-not overly long. Sorry, sir, there's a weight limit on this coaster. Oh, really, what's the limit? The rule is you can't look hilarious on this motor scooter. I'm sorry, there's just no way. Big news out of Six Flags Columbus today, as they unveil what promises to be the largest roller coaster in the United States. That's right, Joyce. They call it The Holocaust. The ride has several Jewish groups up in arms as they go over the first rise. No, I'm-I'm kidding. They're actually pretty upset. Wow. I had heard about the Holocaust, but I never believed it till right now. I have to ride that ride. Peter, come on, they're not going to let you that ride either. You're overweight. Yeah, if you want to ride that roller coaster, you're going to have to go on a diet. A diet, huh? All right, well, how's that work? Well, I suppose you can start by keeping a food journal, like Quagmire does. Yeah, in fact, I got it right here. ""Today I ate peaches ginger honey candy olive"" You know what? This is the wrong list. All right, if that's what it takes to ride that ride, I am going on a diet. And I'm not stopping till I look as good as my great Aunt ""Legs-Go-All-The- Way-Up"" Griffin. Hey, baby, do those legs go all the way up? Why, yes, they do. Oh, my God! You're a monster! Come back. My legs are shaved like a little girl. Hey, what do you got there, Peter? Rice cakes. Never had one, but somebody told me this is a really good way to start your diet. Who who could think of such a horrible thing?! We know you not like rice cake.  Ricey, ricey rice, no one like rice cakes.  All right, Peter, the most important thing when you're on a diet is willpower. Now I'm going to put this steaming pie on the windowsill to cool. Now no matter how many beckoning fingers that steam morphs into or how badly it tries to sneak its way up your nose, I want you to resist the urge to levitate off the ground and float towards the pie. Doesn't seem too hard. All right, go stand over there. No, you don't. No, no, you can't go in there. No, no, stay out of there. That's my special area! No, stop! I'm saying no! What kind of pie is this?! Peter, it's making me watch! Peter, I don't understand why we have to drive all the way to Ohio to ride a stupid roller coaster. Yeah, besides, they're still not going to let you on. You haven't actually lost any weight. Oh, I think my lithe figure would suggest otherwise. A girdle is not a substitute for weight loss, Peter. Hey, I'm riding that roller coaster, and that's all there is to it. Now let's get out of here. This thing's squishing all my organs around. There it is, kids. Columbus, Ohio. Now remember, there are no rules about who can wear stretch pants here, so you're going to see some pretty shocking things. Brian, is this our vacation? Yeah. Oh. Are we trash? Kind of. Oh. I'm sorry, sir. You're too fat to ride the coaster. Aw, darn it. Yeah, why don't you go back to your pond, hippo? How about me, sir? Am I too fat to ride? No, you don't seem to be. Well, you got to hand it to him. He had a dream and he made it happen. That's what the Wright Brothers did. So, how's your boyfriend, Orville, doing? Ex-boyfriend, if you don't mind. And who cares? He's probably off in a barn somewhere working on a contraption with that weird brother of his. Ew. Ha-ha, bitch. You're so pretty. I miss you. Well, this has given me a lot to think about. My son is dead! We are going to have to send that family money. I know we are. Mom, I'm hungry. Can we stop and get some food? Well, I guess it is close to dinnertime. Chris, Stewie, you hungry? What are you looking at? You going to propose? What? Yeah, exactly. ""What?"" Eyes front. What the hell?! Looks like it's the radiator. Well, we're just going to have to find a local mechanic. On a Friday evening? I don't think we're going to have any luck till Monday. Besides, probably not a lot of mechanics around here. So, we're stuck here? Hey, Lois, you see that barn out there? You know who it was built by?  By Mennonites.  Well, I guess we better see if there's a hotel or something. I can't believe we're stuck in Amish country. Yeah, I thought something was ""a-mish."" Hey, uh, excuse me, fella? Yeah, we're looking for a room. Are ye indeed, outsiders? We do not see many of your folk in these parts, but we welcome all of God's children in their hour of need. Well, actually, I think we need it for more than an hour. Or do we, right, Lois? I-I do not last very long. Ugh, creepy. What's this? It's an Amish doll. They're not allowed to have faces. Has something to do with vanity. Looks like a cross-dressing Cobra Commander. Who? Cobra Commander. He's the head of Cobra. The bad guys from G.I. Joe. The guys who oddly shout the name of their terrorist organization as they're attacking. Guys, we're under attack. By who? I don't know. Cobra! Oh, it's Cobra. Oh, of course. Look, they have the pictures of the snakes on their planes. Duke, what have I been saying for years? What makes a good terrorist organization? Brand recognition. Brand recognition. Mom, I can't stay here. There's no electricity, no telephones, it's horrible. Excuse me. I assure you, our community is quite pleasant. Perhaps I could show thee around. Okay. My name is Eli. My parents run the inn. If there is anything we can do to make your room more plain, do not be afraid to ask. Ah, we'll be all right. A hotel in Amish country can't be any worse than staying in a youth hostel. Hi, I'd like a room. Uh, preferably one where I have to sleep with my bag taped to my body. We have one where some Italian backpackers have laid out every item of clothing they own on all of the beds. Oh, perfect. Will my bunkmates be constantly talking about me in a foreign language? Yes, they will, sir. Oh, great. Uh, also, I'm going to have some mail delivered here, and I want it to sit in that box for four years. Oh, and what street is the bathroom on? So, what do you do for fun around here? We do chores and we watch other people do chores. Sounds kind of boring. Alas, there are times when I feel as if there is much of life I am missing. Yeah, it'd be tough having no technology. I don't think I could live without my iPhone. You have an iPhone? Yeah. You've heard of it? Yes, but only because people sometimes search for Amish farms on their iPhones. Here comes one now. Thanks for a fun evening, Eli. And-and thanks for being so nice to me. I think you are the most fascinating girl I have ever met, Meg. Here. I want you to have this. Your iPhone? Yeah. I made you a playlist of songs that I like. Who is this I am hearing? It's Avril Lavigne. Why does she shout at me? I don't know. Most of my music I just get pressured to buy. Thank you for this gift, Meg. Eli! What are you doing with that outsider? Her name is Meg, Father. And I was just showing her our community. You stay away from her. She will try to corrupt you. That is not true, Father. Meg is wonderful. She is an outsider. She does not follow the one true path. You are not to see this girl again. Do you understand? I forbid it. Yes, sir. Now come home at once. And, as for you, I suggest you stay away from my son, you harlot. Hey, there, young one, why so sad? It's just that I really like this boy, but his dad Oh, look out. Sorry, there. Didn't realize how long it'd been since Ol' Dumper did his business. He'll be done soon enough. Oh, maybe not. Doesn't sound like pooping, does it? Sounds more like someone dropping sandwiches off a rooftop. Watch out below, right? Look like Hacky Sacks. You'll be sorry if you kick 'em, though. All righty, well he seems to be all done now. You have a good evening Oh, my goodness. He must have gotten into the chicken feed again. You'd think they'd know it wasn't in their diet, but this is how they find out. You may want to close your mouth. Meg, what's wrong? Eli's father, Ezekiel, said that I can't see him anymore! He said I was trying to corrupt his son! He did, did he? Well, that does it! We are gonna teach this town how to dance! Oh, Meg, I'm so sorry. I'd try to talk to Eli's father for you, honey, but I don't know if it's my place. Ezekiel wouldn't listen to you anyway, Lois. You're a woman. These people live in a patriarchal society. The only member of our family whose word would carry any weight would be Meg's father. Dad, will you talk to Ezekiel? Will you tell him I'm not trying to corrupt his son? Please? All right, I'll do it. But don't expect any miracles. I'm not good with confrontation. Like when I got stuck behind that giraffe at the ballgame. Yeah! Nice hit! Frozen rope! Awesome! What just happened? Ground rule double! Whoo! I couldn't even see it. Yeah, it was something. Ducks on a pond! Let's bring 'em in! Could you please sit down? I am sitting down. You sit up. I am sitting up, but I still can't see a thing. Yeah, sounds like a ""you"" problem. Let's go, Sox! Before we commence with Samuel Fisher's barn raising, let us pray. Dear Amish Lord, thou looketh sternly down upon us thine flock, even though we did not do anything wrong and have been doing chores like (bleep) crazy, please make us humble, and deliver us more hardship, that we may get thick, calloused hands, much larger than other people's. And grant that we become dull, like Eric Bana, who we have never seen, but are just going by reputation because it is your will. We solemnly believe that although humans have been around for a million years, you feel strongly that they had just the right amount of technology between 1835 and 1850; not too little, not too much. Please deliver us from Thomas Edison, the worst human being who ever lived. And protect us from those who laugh at our buggies or our hats and deliver us from mustaches. Amen. Hey, uh, Ezekiel? You must be Mr. Griffin. Look, I-I know you guys are busy with your barn raising and all, but, um, you know, I just wanted to tell you how much my daughter Meg loves your boy Eli. I promise you, she ain't trying to corrupt him or nothing. Mr. Griffin, with all due respect, we live in two different worlds. I must do what is best for my son and I have. Hey, how do we know what's gonna happen? For all we know, Meg might want to Amish herself. I had not considered this. I was verily preoccupied with Eli's corruption. Plus, it is the time of the month when Eli's mother is on the burlap. So whaddaya say, let the kids give it a shot? Perhaps, Mr. Griffin. Perhaps. Good. Now on another note, I notice you don't have a damn lick of music in this town. We do not believe in such ostentations. Well, I am about to change your mind. Introducing rock 'n' roll!  Whoo!   I'm on a highway to hell!   Highway to hell!   I'm on the high  You are banished from our community at once! And take your whore daughter with you! How did it go, Dad? Very well, Meg. My recollection is that it went extremely well. Really?! Oh, my God, Dad, that's fantastic! So I-I can see Eli again? Griffins! What's going on here? Your family must leave our community and return to the outside world. Dad, what's happening? I thought you talked to him. Sir, please, whatever your quarrel is with my husband, I'm sure it's probably justified, but I'm begging you, don't punish the children for it. They're innocent in all this. Innocent, are they? I found this in Eli's corn hole! Well, I His what? A compartment in Eli's room where he stores his corn. Oh. Well, okay, whatever you say. Look, Ezekiel, we would love to go back to the city, believe me. I-I haven't had a drink in three days. But our car broke down. We-we can't go anywhere until it gets fixed. I have arranged to have that taken care of. This ride's gonna be so frustrating. I know. These horses are so slow. Sexy. Sexy. Good-bye, Abraham Lincoln people. I'm sorry, Meg. Eli was the best boy I'll ever meet. And now I'll never see him again. Yes, you will, Meg. Eli. Eli? What are you doing here? I could not let you leave without me, Meg. I love you. I love you, too. Hey, Lois, watch me lay rubber in front of these losers. Hyah! Yeah! Choke on that, nerds. Eli, I agree that your father was being somewhat unreasonable, but I don't think running away is the answer. I know, Mrs. Griffin. And I am sorry. But I just could not bear the thought of never seeing Meg again. You ever seen one of these, Eli? It's a Coleco football game. Pretty mind- blowing, huh? You know what? This is garbage to us. What the hell is that? Holy crap! Who did this? It must have been my father. This is how the Amish declare a feud. But I thought they were nonviolent. We are, but Peter must have really pissed off my dad. Hey, who raked the leaves? And look, somebody mowed the lawn. I was supposed to do that. Ha-ha! I have done your chores to rob you of the joy of doing chores. You bastard. Peter, we don't have a choice. We've gotta bring Eli back. Oh, no, we don't. What are you talking about? We-we can't be part of a feud with the Amish. I didn't start this thing, Lois, but I'm gonna finish it. Joe, go round up Quagmire and all the modern-day technology you can find. We are going to war. Oh. Oh, hey, Bonnie. Is Joe there? Well, can I leave a message for him? Yeah, it's what I said before about the-the war thing. All right, men, this is it. Technology versus old-timey wooden stuff. Let's hit 'em hard. What, again, was the nature of your beef with them? I don't know. Something about a roller coaster. Let's go. Apples fire! Ah! Damn it! Ow! God! Quilters advance! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Oh! Ooh! Oh! I bet this hurts so much! Ow! Damn it! I'm bleeding! Uhp, now it's an AIDS quilt. Suck on this, you furry little weirdoes! Enough of this crap. Ezekiel. Call off your boys and let's you and me finish this man-to-man. Indeed. Prepare for a goodly beating. Dad, stop. Leave him alone. Father, what are you doing? I am going to kill that man. That man is my girlfriend, Meg. This is against everything our people stand for. Will you listen to me for one moment? You were so worried about these outsiders coming into our community and corrupting me. But look at yourself. You're the one who's allowed yourself to be corrupted. God in heaven you are right. I am deeply ashamed. I only wanted to protect you. I know you did, Father. Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Son, it is your life to live. I must accept the life you choose. I choose to stay here. What?! What?! Meg, you are the most beautiful woman I will ever know. You have shown me so many wondrous things that have opened my eyes to the world beyond my home. But this is where I belong. I'm sorry if this upsets you, Meg. I love you, Eli. I'll always love you. If this is what you have to do, then all I can say is I'll never forget you. I am sorry there has been conflict between us. Allow me to make amends. Please help yourself to anything in my corn hole. Hey, don't worry about it. We can still be pals. And I know just the place for us to go and blow off all this steam.  We went dancing across the USA   On that crazy King's Highway   Too much passion   Too much play   We went dancing, dancing, dancing across the USA   We went dancing, dancing, dancing across the USA   We went dancing, dancing, dancing across the USA   We went dancing, dancing, dancing across the USA"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Hey, everyone. You'll never guess who I ran into at the market just now. Your hairdresser who's almost dead from cancer? Ross Fishman. Your old boyfriend? The one with the penis? Peter, would you stop being so jealous? I dated Ross 20 years ago. That's right. And that means he had you first, Lois. I'll always be Scottie Pippen to his Michael Jordan. Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Jordan! And Scottie Pippen. He's also good. Why didn't they do Jordan last? Alphabetical? Oh, right. That's smart. You're smart. But still. Peter, don't be ridiculous. Ross' wife was with him, and in fact, they invited us all over for dinner tonight. Oh, come on, Lois. I hate that guy. I don't want to have dinner with him. Hey! It's cooked food in another house. That's exciting for life-over women like me. We're going. All right, fine. But I'm gonna stare at his wife's boobs so hard that when they both go into the kitchen together, it will be discussed. Ah, the cold car ride through a dark, suburban night. Look out the window and think of death, kids. It's a-comin'. Wow, Pam. Everything smells terrific. Did you make all of this yourself? Yeah, I just got home from work, put down the lawyer's briefcase, and put on the chef's hat. You know how it is. Nah. She don't do nothing. So, Peter, Lois tells me that you're working at the brewery. I think that's great. A real job. Trading futures, that's not real. But the money is unreal. Hey. To real jobs. That's it, Fishman. Shirts off. I want to see who's got bigger pecs. Peter! Well, they look better when they're oiled up. Pass the salad dressing. Oh, no, it's an almost-empty squeeze bottle. Hang on. Eh, it's all out. There's dressing on that salad. Give me that salad. Yeah, who's the better man now, Ross? Brian, what are you doing down there? They didn't set a place for me. Not a dog family. Oh. G'way. G'way, you. So, Ben, do you go to James Woods High? No. I'm a junior at The Meadows. It's a private school. Oh, do they do it so right at The Meadows. Class size is so small. And they really know your child. They care. Mr. Wiggins rested his thing on Jen Crosby's shoulder during a test. Yes, I'm told James Woods High leads the nation in teacher-to-student ""thing resting."" Well, it's family that really matters, and no family is closer than ours. That's why we love taking trips together. Here we are in Machu Picchu. Is that the topless place in South Attleboro? I spat on a chick there at a work retreat. Peter, just stop talking. What? We been places. They ain't so great. Well, this year is perhaps our biggest trip ever. We're climbing Mount Everest. Oh, yeah? Is that right? Well, so are we! We are? Peter, I highly doubt that. I mean, no offense, but it doesn't look like your family would be up to the task. I think he's right about that. After all, we couldn't even turn a double play. All right, Griffins, on the ground, we're going to second. Let's turn two here. Ground ball's a double play ball. Play's at second. Let's look sharp. Tough ""D."" Tough ""D."" Let's flash that leather. Head in the game. Play's to second. This infield is the Great Wall of China: nothing's getting past us. Good ""D"" behind you, Bri. Good ""D"" all around. I'm okay, everyone. Don't worry, I am okay. My voice sounds weird, this is weird, I know, but I feel fine. Man, what a bunch of jerks. Yeah, we should call Ross and tell him, ""This is the hospital, and your mom's dead."" And then, he'll be like, ""What hospital?"" And we'll be like, ""Saint Up Yours,"" and then and then that's, like, two jokes. Look, I'm sorry, Lois. I-I know we can't climb Mount Everest. I-It's just, that guy really got to me, and I wanted to stick it to him. Will you call tomorrow and make some excuse that doesn't make me look bad? Ooh, I know. Tell him I'm a pathological liar and that I've been under a lot of stress because of the child rape charges I'm facing. I think we should do it. What? Lois, you can't be serious. Oh, I'm dead serious. You think I liked sitting there pretending to be polite to those people while they talked down to us like that? Well, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of this family always feeling second best. I want to do something we can be proud of. I want Stewie, Meg, and Chris to grow up with some confidence. Then don't buy our shoes at the car wash. But climbing the world's most dangerous mountain? Isn't that a little extreme? Maybe. But if the Fishmans can do it, so can we. Yeah, we're just as good as them or any other family. That's right. You guys, we're climbing Mount Everest. Let's do it! Yay! I drank seven cups of coffee at the Fishmans'! Oh, crap. It's Quagmire. I don't want him knowing about this. He's always trying to horn in on our plans. Hey, what's going on? You guys up to something? Shh-shh, kids, don't move. Hello? So we're really doing this? We're actually gonna climb Mount Everest? How are you okay with this? Well, if we make it to the summit, I could pee there, and then it would be mine. 'Cause the rule is, the highest pee wins. Okay, gang, once we arrive in Nepal, we'll get all the supplies we need for the trip up Everest. Okay, but remember, kids, the people there have never seen people before. So when they walk up to you, quickly stuff a dollar bill in their mouth. And then you can pet 'em as much as you want. Is that true, Dad? Nah, truth is, I don't know nothing about this place. I don't even know why it's called Nepal. The mountains look like nipples. Well, you can't just call a country Nipples. What about Nepal? Ooh, I like that. Ha. Shocker: God gets it right. Okay, now, we got to make sure we've got all the provisions before we head up to base camp. 'Cause I don't think there's gonna be a Star Market halfway up the mountain. Oh, Mom. That's our local market at home. Okay, let's split up and meet in an hour in front of The Yak Shack. And my mom is pounding on the door, and I'm like, ""Mom, don't come in here. I'm yakking off."" Boo. So, I've been carrying this really promiscuous guide around, and my back starts itching. I go to the doctor, turns out I got sherpies. Ha-ha! Yeah, I'll meet you guys here. I'm just gonna be here. Peter, I don't think we need a donkey for this climb. Of course we don't need a donkey, Lois. It's a status thing here. You, leather man. You sell me donkey. I don't know what it is, but you have got it. Oh, my God. It's enormous. Lois, this is probably a terrible time to remember this, but I think I might have left the weed whacker on. Well, look who's here. I didn't believe you'd actually follow through with this. Oh, hey, Fishman. Hey, listen, on a scale of one to ten, how bad is the bathroom situation up here? Like, ten is a suite at the Four Seasons, and one is a tied-up raincoat sleeve at a party in your honor. Yes, we're here, Ross. When our family says that we're gonna do something, we follow through with it. Yeah, in fact, not only are we gonna climb it, we are gonna beat you guys to the top. I seriously doubt that. Oh, yeah? Well, so do I! Yeah, so you watch it, Fishman. We are gonna beat you so bad, you'll think you gave Chris Brown an STD. Is that what happened? You're not gonna beat us to the top. In fact, you probably won't even climb Everest at all. You don't have the nerve. Like hell I don't. Getting to the top ahead of you is gonna be one of the greatest moments of my life. It might even beat graduating from chiropractor school. Robert Baker. Brad O'Bannon. Anyone. Okay, the Fishmans are heading up the North Face, but I've been studying this map and I think we've got a better chance of beating them if we go up the South Face. Oh, we don't need a map, Brian. I got us a GPMS machine. Go up. What do you think? Just go up. Sorry. Okay, can everyone just stop freaking out and just give me, like, two minutes? God! Everyone's always yelling at me. W All the questions! All right, well, maybe we'll turn you on later and see how you feel. She was so nice in the store. Well, come on, everyone, let's get started. Brian, I'm not sure I can do this. It's chillier out here than Angelina Jolie. Something like that. I-I-I don't know, I-I-I'm so cold. She took that sad old lady's husband. You're just gonna have to block out the cold, Stewie. Picture yourself in a warm place. Okay, I think I can do that.  Do you remember   The 21st night of September?   Love was changing the minds of pretenders   While chasing the clouds away   Our hearts were ringing   In the key that our souls were singing   As we danced in the night   Remember   How the stars stole the night away   Yeah, yeah, yeah   Ba de ya   Say, do you remember   Ba de ya   Dancing in September?   Ba de ya   Never was a cloudy day    Do you want the heat on, sir? Yes, please.   Oh, my God. How are we supposed to get across this? W-We have to walk on those ladders? Guys, be sure to look down the whole time. It's really deep and freaky and disorienting. Peter! Oh, my God! Dad! It's okay! There's a huge pile of dead bodies down here that cushioned my fall! Do any of them seem like they have any extra tampons in their backpack? Uh, no! ""No,"" like you checked and there aren't any, ""no""? Or ""no,"" you're just assuming? I-I'm embarrassed. Peter, you left the flap open. It's like a thousand degrees in here, Lois. Close the tent now! It's freezing! Headline: ""Woman Cold."" My God. I think I see the Fishmans. They're down on that ridge. We're ahead of them! Well, then let's keep moving. You guys, we can do this. We can beat them! Hey, you know, I heard, when you drink at high altitude, it hits you even faster. Whoo! Party! I love you guys! You don't know how much you mean to me. You think you're better than me? Why can't you hit a curveball? I've done nothing with my life! Hey, cats, is everybody cool? Sammy Davis Jr.? What are you doing up here? Whatever Frank tells me to do, man. Hey, Sam, get back in here and carry my golf clubs. Yas, boss! Ew. Seems kind of racist, doesn't it? No, no, 'cause, 'cause Sammy's in on it. Okay But he's still carrying the clubs. This is so hard! I can't do this, Mom! Come on! Keep pushing, kids! We're almost there! I'm feeling nauseous. I think I got altitude sickness. Hey, Brian, you want a pukesicle? I would love a pukesicle. I can see the top of the mountain! Let's move it! We made it! I don't believe it! We climbed Mount Everest! Isn't it amazing, Brian? You can see for Oh, you're doing your pee thing, right. I don't really know what the point is. I mean, there's no way other dogs can smell this. Trust me, Stewie. They'll know. They'll know the world is now mine. no way. Oh, my God, you guys. I'm so proud of us all! We made it! We proved that we're not second-best! Well, look who finally got here. You, you beat us? Don't feel too bad, gang. We only beat you by one hour, And, quite frankly, we're bored of it up here. So you guys enjoy it. We're gonna head back down. I hate those guys. Yeah, me, too. Come on. Let's head back down. At least the hard part's over. I'm not so sure about that. You might want to take a look at those storm clouds. Oh, my God. Yeah, it looks like it's closing in fast. We're all gonna die! All right, everyone get into a hilarious pose, so when they dig out our bodies, they'll have a good laugh. Heh. This guy's pretty funny. This is terrible! The storm keeps getting worse! Mom, I can't even see! And the scarf Brian called ""a gay waste"" makes a rather important appearance. I'm so hungry. Me, too. I don't know if I can keep going. Peter, I still don't understand. How the hell can we already be out of food? Didn't I tell you to bring trail mix? Yeah, but by that I thought you meant a set list of totally awesome tunes, which I do have.  I got the power!  And after this, it's ""Everybody Dance Now"" and after that, it's ""Come Baby Come."" That sounds like Jock Jams. It is similar to Jock Jams. It is Jock Jams. You guys, look, there's something up ahead. I think it's a person. Oh, my God, maybe they have food. Maybe it's a rescue team. Oh, my God, it's Ben Fishman. Is he? Yep. He's dead. Oh, great. Not only are we caught in this blizzard, but there's some maniac up here freezing people to death. That poor boy. We should bury him. It's only right. Yeah, yeah, we should, Lois. You're right. Or we could Could what? Eat him. Brian! Look, if we don't eat something soon, we're all gonna pass out from exhaustion and freeze to death just like him. Are we really considering this? We're talking about eating a person. Yeah, I'm not so sure about this. Oh, I thought we decided. I'm sorry. Well I guess we don't have a choice. I am oddly prepared for this. Oh, God, Peter. I hope Ben would forgive us for what we did. Look, we needed to eat, the same way birds need to fly. What do you mean, you don't have our names on there? My wife and I absolutely have to be on this flight. I'm doing the best I can, sir. Do you have your confirmation number? I think you'll find all the information you need on here. Sir, this is just a piece of paper with the word ""south"" written on it. Can I speak to your supervisor? You guys, there's someone up ahead. Ben?! Ben?! Oh, my God, it's the Fishmans. They look terrible. Have you seen Ben? We lost him in the storm. We're headed back up to find him. I just hope he's not trapped in some crevice somewhere. Well, my gut tells me he'll be squeezing himself out of a crevice very soon. Oh! We finally made it below the storm. Look! I see base camp! Yay! We're gonna be okay! Wait! We have to go back. What? What are you talking about? Kids, your mom is clearly delirious from the altitude. I say we leave her behind and marry that hot new assistant from my work. Look, Ben freezing to death was one thing. We had nothing to do with that. But we just let Ross and Pam walk back up there, probably to their deaths. And you know what? That's not who we are. We're the Griffins. And you know how we win? You know how we keep from being second-best? We do the right thing. We go back up there and save them. Tell me again why we ate a person before we ate the dog. Your mom's right. Let's head back up there. Plus, if we don't rescue the Fishmans, their Jewish god is just gonna sit there and make us feel guilty. You do whatever you want. Over here! I think I smell 'em! Oh, my God! Look down there! We got to get them out! They'll die down there! Well, we've got some rope. Quick, Peter! You're the only one strong enough to carry two people. All right, I got 'em! Pull me up! Peter, we can't do it! You're too heavy! Keep going! You're almost there! I found a rock I like. Griffins, I don't know how to thank you. We never would have made it without your help. Oh, you would've done the same for us. There are more important things than a petty rivalry. We're just happy that you're okay. Well, thank you both. You saved our lives. And Peter, I'll never forget what you did for us. You're a good man. All right, you rest up, get better, we ate your son. Bring it up!"

Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Oh, Stewie, how exciting! Your first visit to a real fire station! Yeah, you kids always loved your first trip to the fire station. You remember when we took Meg? Welcome to the Quahog Fire Department, folks. I'm Captain Beckman. Let me know if you have any questions that I can answer for you. What's up, nerds? You waiting for some guy to fall asleep with a cigarette? Lazy fire turds! Have another donut, pig! We got guns! You got hoses! See you on the softball field! Over here is our kitchen, where we make all our meals. And upstairs is where we sleep. What about your wives and families? Sometimes we don't see them for long periods of time. Well, that sounds awfully lonely. Like being an NBA player on the road. Baby, I miss my wife so much. Thanks for understanding that we can't do anything. I just want to cuddle. Oh, you're so sweet. I'm just doing what a man should do. Respecting the sacred institution of marriage. And now, straight to sleep. This message brought to you by the NBA. Let's all pretend this happens. Hey, Chris, you think it's safe to drink from a fire hose? Why not, Dad? It's just water. All right, well, turn it on. I'm very thirsty. Nice job, Chris. You got my shirt wet. Now, few people realize that until 1928 there were no hoses, and you actually had to fight fires with your bare hands. I will now give a demonstration. Whoa, scrappy little blaze, huh? Oh, my God, the fire's got a gun! What the  was that? Come on, Stewie. We're going. Just a moment, Brian. I'm pretending I'm a fireman. I love playing pretend. My name's Peter and I work in the brewery. Now I'm gonna put on my pants and go talk to my coworkers at These pants have stool in them. Well, I hope everyone had a fun afternoon at the firehouse. I sure did, Mom! I can't wait for the next family outing! Aw, thanks, Mike. I hate fire stations. No problem, man. Is that alcohol on your breath? Yeah, maybe. You're playing this too fast and loose, Mike! Ooh, ooh, is that the mail? Yeah. Is there anything in there for me? I want to see if there's a response to all those fan letters I've been writing. Dear Cary Elwes, I have been meaning to contact you for some time. I have never been able to figure out if you are famous. You were a big deal in one thing, but you were wearing a mask for most of it. Do you consider your career a disappointment? Or rather, did you exceed your own expectations? Yours truly, Peter Griffin. P.S. You were in Robin Hood: Men in Tights. Did you know that? Hey, there's something here from the Nielsen Company. ""Dear Griffin family, ""You have been specially selected from amongst millions ""of American households to be a Nielsen family, ""and as such, to have your TV viewing habits monitored in order to measure television ratings."" Oh, kids, this came all the way from Delaware. What does all that mean? Well, Meg, it sounds like they want us to be part of a select group of people that helps determine what's on TV. We're gonna be a Nielsen family? That's awesome! I think uh I think that's the wrong music. There you go. Now, this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans. Ah, yes. And what was that beginning, middle and end part again? Um this Nielsen box will keep track of everything you watch, which helps us generalize the viewing habits of millions of Americans. Is there any way you can describe that to me using colorful puppets of some sort? The Nielsen box will monitor your viewing habits! I don't like the left puppet. His chin is scary. Well, thanks for your cooperation. If you have any questions, please call me. And welcome to the Nielsen family. Thank you very much. Well, isn't this exciting. I know, I can't believe we're a Nielsen family! I never get picked for anything. All right, everyone. Time to do our Nielsen duty. So, what are we gonna watch? Boobs! Project Runway! The Good Wife! That black version of our show! You know, guys, this is a real opportunity to promote quality programming. I think we should watch PBS. Yeah, you're real passionate about PBS. You donated once five years ago and they sent you a mug. And now the mug's so old that the ""P"" has been worn off so it just says ""B.S."" It's libtards like you that are screwing up our country. Tom Tucker? What are you doing here? Well, I heard you're the new Nielsen family. Just hoping you plan to watch the Channel Five News. I don't know. I've missed so many. It's gonna take me forever to catch up. Well, we'd sure love to have you as a viewer. Is there anything we can do to make the news more appealing to you? Maybe. I guess you could lose the moustache. Lose my moustache? Well, gosh, I I don't know. My birthmark makes it kind of tough. Always caused me problems at my old job. And that'll do it for us here at Channel 12 News. Make sure you turn those clocks ahead. Good night, St. Louis. Yeah, I don't know, I was never that crazy about the moustache. Well, I suppose I could lose it and just use more makeup. Yeah, that'd be cool. And maybe a festive hat would make things more festive. All right, this is good. Any other suggestions? Yeah, can you end each show by trying to pull-start a very cold chain saw? Well, that shouldn't be a problem. All right, thank you for being so candid. Hey, thanks for listening. I know how hard it is to take criticism. Hey, nice boots, Griffin. They sell men's shoes where you got those? You made a commitment to these boots, Peter. These boots are the new you, and no one will shake that. Yee-haw, ride 'em, cowgirl! Okay, you can take the boots off at lunch. Go to the gym. Have a workout. Come back in your sneakers. If anyone asks, you forgot the boots in your locker. Just make it to lunch. Those boots are made for walkin'. Up to guys' butts. Hey, fellas. Hey. Good evening, Quahog. Tonight, Channel Five mourns the loss of a dear colleague. My moustache. And as per the wishes of my moustache, his ashes were sprinkled off the coast of Acapulco where he was born. Well, that'll do it for us here. Thanks for watching Channel Five, the most trusted name in news. Ah, crap. Oh, come on. Let's go, Tom. Work, damn it! What the hell? What's going on with the news? This is terrible! Yeah, has he lost his mind? Well, I'll be damned. If I knew he was gonna do all that stuff I told him, I would've told him more stuff. What? Peter, you told him to do this crap? Yeah, he came to my house when he found out I was a Nielsen family, asked what I wanted to see. Hey, hey, you know what would be cool? If he did the news with a family of prairie dogs, and whenever he said something sad, they'd pop their heads up, all concerned. Peter, you sure that's such a good idea? People rely on the local news to provide them with several stories a year on how saltwater taffy is made. Yeah, if you're a Nielsen family, it seems like you should maybe be a little more thoughtful with your choices. What are you talking about? I'm just having a little fun. For God's sakes, I've just been handed the coolest freaking toy on the planet. Well, you know, except for Hungry Hungry Alec Baldwins. Hey, I'm not I'm not even touching the lever. Chilling news from Long Island Sound, as a four-passenger prop plane on its way to East Hampton spun into the surf off Montauk Point. There were no survivors. Oh, that's so great, I just called him on the way home! Peter, I'm not sure this is entirely responsible. I don't see what the big deal is. I was just trying to make the show better. Hell, I wish I could do it with all the shows. Yeah, well, you only have one Nielsen box. You don't have the clout to affect national shows. Damn it. I guess that means I'll never get to see an episode of Superman where Clark Kent and Lois Lane finally get together. Lois, I love you, and I want there to be no more secrets between us. I am Superman. Oh, my God. The only thing that can kill me is kryptonite. Or latex. Or lambskin. What about polyurethane? All that. All that stuff. Hi, folks. Just thought I'd stop by and make sure your equipment is working properly and see if you have any questions. Yeah, is something wrong with our remote? No matter how low I turn the volume, Aziz Ansari is always shouting at me. What did I do? Thank you. I think we're good. Everything seems to be going well. Okay, great. Well, I'm just gonna change out the card on your unit real quick and I'll be on my way. Well, we're all set. Thanks for your time. No, thank you, pal. And hey, you've been working hard. Why don't you take the rest of the day off? Here's two tickets to Sandra Bernhard's one-woman show. Wow, thanks! Yeah, and they're great seats. They're right in the gap of her teeth. Social media? More like a social disease. Ha! That's funny! Peter, what the hell's going on here? Lois, we're no longer one Nielsen family. We're 100. More boxes, more power. And I got some ideas to make TV better. Hello, Mad Men production office. Yeah, Peter Griffin here. Could I speak with Jon Hamm, please? One moment. Hello? Hello, Jon Hamm? Peter Griffin, Nielsen family. Listen, did I catch you at a good time, or are you and the critics busy sucking each other's butts? Excuse me? Look, your show is really boring. But don't worry, I got some ideas on how you can jazz it up. Listen, I don't need your suggestions, pal. I've been a big celebrity for a year and a half now. Okay, if that's how you're gonna be. We'll see how this plays out. Lois, we're not watching Mad Men no more. Hello? Look, I may have been a little rash. Our ratings have dropped 50%. Whatever suggestions you have, I'll listen. And so, gentlemen, in baseball, three strikes and you're out. But three Lucky Strikes and you're in. Nice try, Don. But I'm afraid we're going to have to take our business elsewhere. Oh? don't think so. (playing Star Wars theme) What the hell was that? I'll tell you what it was, Lois. It was awesome. And wait'll you see Breaking Bad. I don't know what it was, but now it's on roller skates. Hi, NBC, this is Peter Griffin. Listen, you guys are doing a great job. If anybody knows what America wants in the '90s, it's NBC. But I just have one small request: I like Dateline, but I really hate waiting two hours to find out who the killer is. Tonight on Dateline, a woman murdered. Was it her ex-boyfriend? Yes, it was. I knew it. I knew it was the ex-boyfriend. ""Sleep tight, truck. ""Sleep tight, firefly. ""Sleep tight, chair. Sleep tight, bird."" You see that, Peter? You see the bird? Bird. Okay, we'll, uh, pick up the rest tomorrow. Uh, now, I'm just gonna vamp for a while with some random noises. Hee-hee! Heya, heya, heya. Uh-heh, uh-heh Okay, good night, Peter. Good night, Dave. And, uh, here's Paul to play you to sleep with a lullaby.  Hey, lullaby   Oh, lullaby   Hey, you, lullaby  Stop, no, stop. Stop. I forgot, he's terrible. We now return to Cops With Banana Guns. Freeze! Is that is that a banana? Don't worry about what it is. I'm still a cop. Whoa, hold on. All-All right, just just take it easy. This can go a couple of ways. What the hell did Peter do to Cops?! Bonnie! Come push me out in a huff! Peter, what is this show? It's called Creeping Up on the Kardashians. See that guy with the ponytail in the background? He sneaks up and scares the girls while they're starting businesses or getting their fat waxed. What the hell?! There they are! That's the Nielsen family! You ruined television! Now it's just a big, old, silly mess! Oh, God! An angry mob! I've got to swallow all my valuables and get out of here! Did you see the mob? Did I see the mob? Why else am I here? Oh, my God, Peter, they're really angry! Say something! W-Wait. What the hell's going on? What do you mean, I ruined television? You put a real cougar on Cougar Town, and now that cougar's dead because Courtney Cox ripped it apart with her teeth and claws! You turned Anderson Cooper 360 into Anderson Cooper 720! He's turning around too much! You converted The Biggest Loser to the metric system! Now it feels like they're not losing enough! Aw, the hell with you guys! You're just jealous 'cause I get to say what's on TV now! I am a Nielsen god! Sorry, y'all. That's the first time I ever throwed anything. Well, if it isn't Mr. Nielsen himself. Nurse, who's the worst doctor in this hospital? You are, Dr. Hartman. Good. Put Hartman on this bozo. Hey, what can I do for you? Please, Doc, you got to help me with this nasty gash. What seems to be the problem? No, it's my husband. Oh. Well, you've got a lot of nerve coming in here after what you did to television. Now, get out! Please, Doctor, you've got to help him. You took an oath when you went to medical school. I took a lot of things when I went to medical school. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to answer this. Hello? Ah, Hartman! Hey, guys. How you doing? Not so good, Peter. Yeah, me, either. Thanks to you, TV's a vast wasteland. You know how I know that phrase? I read it in a book, you monster! Aw, come on, let me make it up to you. Let me buy you a beer. No, that seat's taken. Move along, Peter. What are you talking about? You guys are my pals. We used to be, Peter. Now, scram. Well, fine, I'll sit at the bar. Not at my bar, you won't. Get out of here! Geez, I can't show my face anywhere. I might as well be back doing public radio. This is Peter Griffin, and you're listening to Book Talk on WRNI. Today we'll be discussing Bret Easton Ellis's popular work, Less Than Zero, a tale of privilege, detachment and youthful alienation. But first, a word from our sponsor, Westin's Golden Soda Biscuits. I'm enjoying one right now. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. That concludes today's session of Book Talk. Tune in tomorrow when we will look at John Kennedy Toole's unheralded early work, The Neon Bible. Hey, what's wrong, Peter? I miss my friends, Brian. I mean, I was having fun with those Nielsen boxes, but what's the point if I don't got Joe and Quagmire to enjoy it with me? I guess I shouldn't have messed with television. Well, it's not exactly your fault. The networks never should have listened to you in the first place. This is exactly what makes bad television: pandering to the lowest common denominator. So what do I do, Brian? Well, you still have these boxes. That means you still have the power to influence television. Maybe you can use that power to help restore TV to the way it was. You're right, Brian. Maybe if I watch smart, quality shows, that'll help get things back to the way they were. We can use these boxes for good and What the hell?! That's for adding another tree to One Tree Hill! Oh, my God, he destroyed every last box! Holy crap! We're sunk now, Peter. There goes your one chance to get TV back to the way it was. Wait a minute. Maybe not, Brian. I think I just got an idea. Aah! I got glass in my face! Oh, crap. Now I forgot what it was. I got it! Aah! Son of a bitch! You know who I hate? The troops. Yeah, me, too. Whoa, whoa, whoa, who are you? I'm Peter Griffin. I'm the guy who ruined television, and I'm the guy who's gonna fix it. Guys! I broke television, and now you have to help me fix it! Yah-ha! Looks like this is one we beat you to. Gentlemen, I have gathered you all here today because you are the creators of what television used to be before I ruined it. And we need to rebuild television from the ground up. So, I'm gonna need all your best ideas. J.J. Abrams, you take wonder and complexity and present it in a way that no one can possibly understand. Whaddaya got?! I've got an alien that goes back in time and encounters a koala bear in an Eastern European town. Totally confused. Do it! Okay, now, we're gonna need where people talk to the camera for some reason. You, you, you and you-- go. When Peter told me to make a workplace comedy where people talk to the camera, I thought Not now! I mean, go do a show! Don't-don't do that thing here. Huh. Wonder if I can pull off one of those ""can you believe what I have to put up with"" looks to the camera. Okay, Mark Burnett, you did Survivor and The Apprentice. Can you give me a reality show where people do horrible, unforgiveable things to each other for embarrassingly small sums of money? I got some ideas. Here's a nickel, pull down your pants. There's a show. Yah-ha! Go! All right, now, who's gonna make a show about horrible New Jersey freaks? You know what? I don't care. Just someone, do it! Okay, Dick Wolf, make the same Law and Order six times. Oh, and also, could you marry Matt Weiner 'cause I want your name to be Dick ""Weener."" Okay, but can I go by ""Dick Wolf-Weener""? Oh, my God, yes! Yes! Yes! Okay, Bravo people, go find women fighting. No, you know what, just find women. They'll end up fighting. All right, everyone who's left, make a talent show. We are done. Oh, Kelsey Grammer, what are you still doing here? I-I have nothing left for you. I'm I'm sorry. Ah. Then I shall take my ease on the lanai. I don't care what you do now. We now return to Mike and Molly. Have you decided what you'd like to order? Yes, the chopped salad? I'll have everything except that. That waiter's like, ""What?!"" Well, you did it, Peter. You got TV back to normal. Yeah, guys, I'm sorry for screwing up all your favorite shows. Ah, that's okay, Peter. So, what do you say? Are we pals again? Ah, course we are. You bet. Well, let's drink to having TV back in the hands of people who know what they're doing. I think Zack and Cody would be funnier if they did the show in their underpants."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Boy, what a great day for a baseball game. Yeah, and these are the best seats in the house for catching home run balls. Aw, that'd be sweet. The only souvenir I ever got was at that stock car race. All right, I got the guy! I got the guy. Man, I hate the Yankees. Yeah! You are all villains to me because I happen to live in this region of the country. Yeah! What's going on? Did I miss something? Nah, just some idiot streaking across the field. Ha ha. You're all looking at my penis. You didn't plan on it, but it's happening. Oh, cool. Two spots opened up. You, uh-- y-you go ahead. I can wait. I might-- I might wait for a stall. Oh, come on, Peter. We're missing the game. Hey. Hi. Hey. Damn it. He already started. If I don't start peeing soon, it's gonna be weird. He'll be all done, and I'll still be here. Come on, Peter. Pee. Your dad fought in World War II, and you can't even pee in a urinal? What the hell's wrong with you? All set? Yup. I know you didn't go. I'm'a go pee in a stairwell. Now batting for the Red Sox, number 34, David Ortiz. Come on, Big Papi! It's coming straight for us! I got it, I got it! Mine! I got it! It's my ball Damn it, Brian! That came to me! That's my ball! What? Holy crap! Wow, I guess all this time, Quagmire should've been saying ""wiggity."" Ha! No, but he'sour friend. And now it's time for the Channel Five Sports Report brought to you by Kia. Kia: Too bad it's a Kia. A big day at Fenway today, as the Red Sox bested the Yankees seven to six. But what really has everyone talking is the fan who lost his toupee at the game. The hilarious video already has over two million views on YouTube. Comments ranged from sympathy all the way to racial slurs directed at others who chose to comment. Great, I'm a laughingstock. What do I do? Come on, Quagmire. It's not so bad. You could kill yourself. Well, it's just a thought, but have you ever considered just embracing your baldness? Yeah, Brian's right. You know, there's lots of big Hollywood celebrities who have gone bald with dignity. John Travolta, David Spade, Nicolas Cage, Jeremy Piven And besides, don't you think you'll be happier just being who you really are? Maybe you're right. What the hell. I mean, wh-what other choice do I have at this point? Everybody knows now anyway. Great. Trust me. Nobody's gonna give you a hard time. And even if they do, just ignore them. That's what I do with that weekend bully. Hey, your weekend sucks! I've already gone on a hike and fixed a few things around my house! What are you doing?! Peter, who is that man? I don't want to talk about it. Dad, there's a weird bald guy out in front of our house. Ah, that's just Quagmire. He's acting all different now that he's bald. I'll go talk to him. Hey, slow down! Drive like hell, you'll get there! Quagmire, what the hell are you doing? I'm just letting all these hot-rodders know that this is a neighborhood, not a speedway track. Too fast, too fast! Our children should not have to live in fear! Okay, well, how come you're not doing this in front of your own house? Oh, my ham radio interferes with the radar gun. Talked to a fella in Papua New Guinea last night. You should come by sometime and join in the fun. Hello? H-Hello? Are you bald? Yeah. Can I help you? Well, I hope you can, Sharon. I'd just like to return this VHS copy of Pete's Dragon. Watched, enjoyed and rewound. Uh, there are a lot of people waiting. Is there anything else? Uh, yes. Do you have a garbage can back there? I have the backings to some Fruit Roll-Ups I need to discard. I'm sorry. That's for library trash only. I understand. That's okay. I'll just hold on to these for the rest of the day. It ain't easy bein' green, huh? That's from a song. Is that all? Yeah. Is there an age restriction for the sleight-of-hand magic show this afternoon? Twelve. Ooh. Maybe I'll just stand in the hallway and look in. Now, we all saw you put your card back in the deck. So, how did it end up in your shirt pocket? Oh, my God, how did he do that? Oh, no, there's Quagmire. He's been so weird lately. You notice now that he's bald, whenever he thinks about something, he scratches his wrist? Hey, Quagmire, we got a pitcher. You want a beer? Ehh, I don't think so. I was planning on looking at pictures of birds later, and I don't want to be all fuzzy-headed for that. Listen, Quagmire, we hate you now. Yeah, you used to be fun. Yeah, now you're always either preparing for a colonoscopy or just coming back from a colonoscopy. The  going on down there? Well, that's what we're trying to figure out. Come on, we want our buddy back. I'm not putting that toupee on again, Peter. So I-I'm not sure what you want me to do. You could get a hair transplant. Oh, yeah. Like one of those guys pretending to get out of the pool. That looks all right. Yeah, come on, Quagmire. Get the hair transplant. Come back to us. You're right. This isn't me. Baldness is for women's crotches, not men's heads. There you go, that's pretty gross. Yeah, that's the spirit, Quagmire. Oh, boy, listen, thanks for putting up with me the last couple weeks. Hey, no problem. You put up with me when I was barefoot guy. Boy, nothing like a beer with the fellas, eh? Peter, would you mind putting on some shoes? Oh, you mean foot prisons? Yes, I would. Glenn Quagmire? Why does that name sound familiar? Oh, yeah, I treated you for butt flu. Hey, you want to keep it down? Easy now. That's my privilege as a doctor to talk about that stuff. How's it going, Dr. Kamada? Bob! Mattaaayy. Oh, hiya, Rachael. Oh, hey, Dr. Geller. Sarah. Jim. Merianna. Geez, Joe. Yeah, I come here a lot. All right, I'm gonna hit the john. Good. Me and Joe can stay here and tell secrets. I'm wearing my dead grandmother's panties. I'm sorry to have to tell you this, Mr. Pewterschmidt, but the cancer is terminal. If you're lucky, you've got two weeks to live. I understand. Oh, my God! Carter's dying?! I now declare this hair transplant officially over! Hey, hey, hey! He's back! You look great, Quagmire. Oh, my God. One of my patients on Two has been shot. Hey, Stewie. Um, hey, what's up? Were you-- were you just looking at Rollerblades? What? No. Yeah, who cares? What do you want? Listen, I was at the hospital earlier, and I heard something I wish I hadn't. Oh, please do not tell me it was a sexist remark, because because that is not okay. You know, those nurses are busting their asses, weighing people and seeing how tall they are. Stewie, I heard a doctor tell Carter he has two weeks to live. What? Are you sure? I saw it with my own eyes. I gotta check this out. Oh, my God, you're right! He looks awful. Wait, how are we seeing this? Oh, I've got a nanny cam hidden inside his house. Watching him nail his cleaning woman is how I'm learning Spanish. Although I'm not sure what the Spanish word ""no"" means, because it doesn't seem to mean the same thing as it does here. And the worst part is, I don't think Lois even knows he's sick. Oh, this is going to destroy her! Oh, just thinking about it makes me all giddy. Like a group of women ordering dessert. And then we have a chocolate, chocolate cake that's infused with chocolate served with chocolate ice cream and a molten chocolate topping. We'll have one of those with four spoons. More like four of those with one spoon for me! Oh, hi, Brian. Hey, Lois. Listen, I have something I need to tell you, but it might be difficult for you to hear. What is it? Lois I think your father is dying. What?! Ha! Brian, what are you talking about? Well, yesterday at the hospital, I heard a doctor tell him he has cancer and that he has two weeks to live. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Daddy! Yeah, I feel really horrible for you, and I hate to do this, but I'm trying to catch a 4:50 movie, and it's, like, 4:40 now, and, so, if I'm going to make it, I have to leave, like, now. Yeah, this-this stinks, but I've already blown this guy off, like, twice, so I've been trying to call my parents all day, and I can't get ahold of them. I'll tell ya, this obituary came out great. ""Carter Pewterschmidt died today of the disease cancer. ""In lieu of flowers, please send carnival rides to Peter Griffin at 31 Spooner Street."" If we get just one ride out of this, it will have been a success. Lois? Wh-What are you doing here? Mom, I've been trying to get ahold of you. Is Daddy okay? Where is he? Oh, he's fine, dear. But now's not a good time. He's very busy. Look, I know something's going on. I want to see him. Daddy?! Well, look who's here! Daddy! You're okay! Of course I'm okay! Why wouldn't I be? Well, Brian said you were dying! And I finished a book! I promised myself I'd work that in. I-It's-- I might've jumped the gun. I didn't finish it. I'm so glad you're all right. Brian, how could you get us all worked up like that?! Yeah, shame on you! Oh, you're gonna get it, Brian. You are gonna get it when I drink. What the hell's going on? Last night, Carter was on his deathbed, and now he looks better than he ever did. Well, they say laughter is the best medicine. Maybe he went to a comedy club or something. In my neighborhood, we didn't have no Kool-Aid. We had food colorin' and water. Mama used to call it ""Fool-Aid."" No, I don't get that. And everybody had an Uncle Earl. You know, that uncle that sit around in the house all day in his underdrawers, saying he ""between"" jobs. To be between jobs, you had to have had a job in the first place! That's accurate! And Earl got that cell phone. He on the Sprint plan. When the bill come, he sprint. Yes! So many of them are delinquent in payment. Rupert, move your legs. I can see your balls. Stewie, this is going to sound crazy, but I have a theory about what's going on with Carter. Really? What is it? Well, think about it. If Carter Pewterschmidt, the dynamic chairman of Pewterschmidt Industries, were to fall ill or even die, the stock price would plummet. I don't want you to think I'm not listening, but when's Christmas? Not for a while. But what I'm saying is, I think Carter is sick or possibly even dead, and that the man we saw today was an imposter brought in to keep Pewterschmidt Industries' stock price up and to keep people from knowing the truth. Boy, you are just going to keep on talking with that poppy seed stuck in your teeth, aren't you? Anyway, what are you suggesting? We can follow him, see if he's really Carter. Okay, but I got to be home by 7:00. I'm supposed to talk to the police about that shooting I witnessed. Go Lord, are you all right? If I die, leave two dollars worth of flowers right here. Here's my fourth grade class photo. Lean it against a cheap candle. Well, should I call an ambulance? No. Call Channel Nine. And have a gap-toothed woman say, quote, ""He never bothered nobody."" Okay, if this guy is an imposter, he's going to have to do everything Carter normally does. We just have to wait and see if he slips up. All right, here he comes now. All right, Stu, now, if we can just No. What? You know what you did. Hey, wait a minute. If this is an imposter, then this guy we're following never had cancer. Yeah, so? Well, you're a dog. Can't you just sniff cancer? No, that's just a myth we started so we could stick our snouts in girls' boobs. It's nice to have a clean bill of health. Well, for now. The key is weekly follow-ups. You know, cervical cancer is also a problem. My boyfriend thinks he might have prostate cancer. Nope, doesn't. Okay, now we've got him. The real Carter would never go to a Starbucks. He thinks they're too liberal and pretentious. Coffee for Brent. Latte for Cecil. Beanie? None of those people are real. I'm stealing all your sugar packets and napkins. Woodstock's over,. Wow. You certainly look a lot better than that walking corpse I saw last week. Well, no one's ever going to see that again, I can promise you that. I can't stress how important it is our secret be kept from the public. I understand, sir. And I assure you that Specimen Z is secure on level 12. Did you hear that, Brian? That ""walking corpse"" was Carter dying of cancer. This guy is an imposter. Oh, my God. And I bet Specimen Z is the real Carter's body. You two didn't hear that, did you? Hey, buddy, we're we're just trying to read the paper here. I'll have you fired for talking to me like that. I don't work here. Then I'll have you killed. I want to die. I hated that guy back there. Okay, this is level 12. There's the lab. Let's get in there and find Carter's body. Oh, crap, there's a keypad. All right, we're just going to have to try and figure out the code. When's his birthday? I think it's in March. Stewie, are you crazy? That's so loud. The guards will hear. Don't worry about it, Bri Hey, what's going on down there? Nothing. All right. All right, now, where would they keep a dead body in a pharmaceutical lab? Brian, look. That's it. I bet he's in there. Oh, my God. Specimen Z isn't Carter's body. What is it? Specimen Z is a cure for cancer. Carter didn't die. He cured himself. Hold it right there. Damn it, Brian. You broke into my lab. And you didn't wear a suit. Hey, why didn't he have to wear a suit? See what you've started now? Carter, you've found a cure for cancer? Well, I didn't come up with it. A couple of eggheads I hired did. One of them's a Chinese. Boy, I don't like those people. But holy crap, wind 'em up and watch 'em go. How long have you had this? I don't know. When when was that ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" song? You've had this since 1999? You know when ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" came out? It's a song about dogs and letting them out. I could have you arrested for breaking in here. Carter, you've discovered the holy grail of modern medicine. Why the hell would you keep it buried like this? I'll tell you why. Because there's far more money to be made in treating a disease than in curing it. Why cure someone of cancer in a day if we can treat them for a lifetime and bill them every step along the way? What? That's insane. Brian, it's so cold in here, look how big my nips are. They're almost like a woman's. Oh, look, I'm tugging at 'em and they're getting even bigger. Carter, what you're doing here is criminal, and I'm going to tell the whole world about it. Is that right? Who's going to believe you? The Internet? You'll be just another nut-job, left-wing blogger. Security! Everything's fine. No, it isn't. Get in here. Ah! Damn it! You bastards. I don't know why you're surprised by this, Brian. Big corporations never tell the truth. ok at the Kleenex industry. Well, we had another good quarter. I guess a lot of people are sneezing out there. Jerry, I'm going to let you in on something, and it can't leave this room. Our research shows the primary use of our product is sperm. What? Yeah, and brace yourself for this. The second biggest use is women crying about nonsense. But I thought sneezing was Jerry, Jerry, it's sperm and nonsense. I can't believe Carter would sacrifice millions of lives just to protect corporate profits. Well, don't be too upset. Old Stewie here snagged a little souvenir on his way out. Oh, my God, Stewie. You got the cancer cure. How'd you manage to steal it? Oh, it was easy-- I just took it while you guys were yammering on. I swear, I felt like I was waiting for Lois to get off the phone. Well, that is amazing. All right, Bonnie. Well, it was good talking to you. No way. She did? When did she say that? You know what? That doesn't surprise me. That's how she is. Okay, then. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, I'll see you Tuesday. Oh, no. What happened? That's terrible. Oh, my God, just awful. Well, you give them my best. Okay, I got to go. Stewie and I are headed out to the beach. Oh, I didn't tell you? He's learning to swim. Oh, I got him the cutest swim trunks. At Kohl's. You've never been to Kohl's? Well, let me tell you about Kohl's. All right, well, you know the mall with the Chili's? It's across the street. Bonnie? Bonnie, are you there? - What happened? - Let's go! Oh, there you two are. Lois, there's something incredible I have to tell you. And there's something incredible I have to show you. I learned how to do a somersault. Did I do it? There he is. Crap. Daddy? What's going on here? Brian here has stolen something very important from me. Give it to me, Brian. Lois, your father has a cure for cancer, but he won't release it because it's not profitable. So I stole it. Daddy, is this true? Yeah. So what? So I found the cure for cancer and didn't announce it. Big deal. I also took a dump today and didn't issue a press release. Oh, that's interesting, because I did. Good for Peter. It's about time the media covered something positive. Daddy, you're the chairman of a billion dollar company. You've got more money than anyone could ever spend in one lifetime. Are you challenging me to a Brewster's Millions? Is money all that you care about? What if somebody close to you got cancer? What if what if the maid who raised you 'cause your parents were too wealthy and busy got cancer? You mean Mamie? Yeah. What if Mamie got cancer? Mamie's not getting cancer! Or how about one of us? What if I got cancer or, God forbid, one of your grandchildren? For once in your life, do the right thing. All right, pumpkin. I'll do it. I'll do it for you. You will? You promise? Yes. I'll make the announcement tomorrow. Oh, Daddy. Thank you so much. You're my hero. Oh, that's her father? Good afternoon. I'm Tom Tucker. Our top story: a big announcement out of Pewterschmidt Pharmaceuticals today. Company chairman Carter Pewterschmidt released a statement announcing the launch of a deodorant for the developmentally disabled called Slow Stick. It's also edible because, you know, those people don't, uh don't know And now sports. That's it? What the hell? Where's the cancer cure announcement? That son of a bitch went back on his word. Hello. Daddy, we're all sitting here in front of the TV awaiting the big announcement. Remember the one that's going to benefit all mankind? The one you promised to make for me, your daughter? I lied. Lois, you can't stay mad at him. He's rich and successful. It doesn't excuse what he did. It'll be fine. He'll just do a magazine cover with a wink to who he is, and all will be forgiven. Oh, Daddy. I know. If he's such a bad guy, why's he on a magazine?"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Hi, there. Hi. I'm Cindy. The only way I believe I'm pretty is if strangers have sex with me. Well, maybe I could help fill you up with self-confidence. Brian. Hello there, sexy. Hey, do you mind? We were having a conversation. My house has 8,000 square feet, zero bookshelves. Wow, that's impressive. I'm a writer, published twice. I own a cinder block yard. Have over 12,000 cinder blocks. If you ever need cinder block, I can get you good price. Thank you. I-I have a six-CD changer, so you can pretty much fill the tray and create a world. Come have sex with me. My mother will make you farkshekoosh when we are done. Okay. Wait! I have a time machine. You do? Yeah, you want to see it? Yes, I want to see it! Better luck next time, pal. Some people got moves, others don't. Been that way forever. You. Me. Sex. Him legend. Shh. Why do you keep a sleeping baby in your time machine room? I-I don't know, my decorator's terrible. Where are we? Ford's Theater, April 14, 1865. Ooh, Valentine's Day. How romantic. Uh, yeah, sure, you know me. Oh, my God, the president's been shot! If you ask me, the president's the lucky one. How's that? He doesn't have to sit through the rest of the show. Yes, I'd like to return this printer. The frame is crashing to the ground, not quite to the mooring mast! Oh, the humanity! And all the passengers screaming around here! And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, there's a dog having sex with a woman! Oh, I know I said, ""Oh, the humanity!"" before, but seriously, oh, the humanity even more right now! I mean, come on! So that's what restaurants were like before desegregation. It was quiet. It was quiet. Wow, Brian, you've had quite a string of female guests spend the night lately. Yeah, whatever you're doing, it's working. You should see the way I have to pick up chicks. Hi. Well, I guess you can call me the Man of La Muncha. Hey, why does your time machine have a sticker that says ""property of Stewie Griffin?"" Uh, well, I-I All right, to be completely honest, and because we've already had sex, it's not mine. I use it all the time, and the owner has no idea. In fact, he'd kill me if he knew. Really? Won't he see that thing on the control panel that says ""years traveled""? What thing? Here's where Brian goes berserk. Look, it's no big deal. Just reverse it and take off the miles. That's what I do when I take my dad's car out. Are you are you 16? I will be next September. Well, I think someone has a Barnes & Noble gift card coming for their silence. Brian, what the hell are you doing in here? What's happening to my time machine? I-I don't know, man. I-I saw Meg leaving a minute ago, going, ""Wah-ha-ha-ha-ha,"" but I-I don't know. Oh, my God, it's having a complete meltdown! What happened? I don't know. Dear God, my time machine! You, uh you want to tell me about this? See? I told you. It was Meg. I don't think so. The crotch doesn't look like a BMX track. You bastard! You've been using my time machine to nail your bar skanks! Oh, come on, they're not all bad. Oh, yes, I've seen the women you bring home. That stutterer? She was a real prize. How are you enjoying your meal? L-L-Lois, it's d-d-d-delicious. Oh, for crying out loud. Peter, why are you turning up the heat again? Lois, this woman is obviously freezing. Brian, I want you to tell me exactly what you did to my time machine. Well, I didn't want you to find out I'd been using it, so I tried turning the chronological gauge backward. It's not designed to go backward, Brian. The question is, how am I going to fix it? What the hell? Dear God, everything's moving backward. What? What are you talking about? I don't know what the hell you did with all your messing around, Brian, but somehow my machine seems to have reversed the direction of time. Reversed the direction of time? Stewie, what does that even mean? I don't get it. Oh, ok, now I get it. Stewie, you can't just change the direction of time. H-How is this even possible? Well, clearly, when you attempted to reverse the gauge on my time machine, you somehow released a quantum shock wave powerful enough to push the flow of time in the opposite direction. I can only surmise that you and I were isolated from its effects because we were inside the machine at the moment of temporal inversion. Are you are you sleeping? Huh? No, no, I No, I was listening. What kind of jerk alters time, and then falls asleep? Look, I'm sorry, Stewie, but do you think you can fix it? Well, it's gonna take a while to rebuild the machine, and even longer to recalibrate it for normal time, but I've taken on bigger challenges before. I had to explain to America why Heidi Klum broke up with Seal. Face. There, now you've got a fresh new diaper, Stewie. What are you talking about? What's going on? I think you're getting a diaper change. Aah! Get that poop-filled thing away from me! No! Oh, God, it's cold! Whew! Smells like somebody needs a diaper change. Damn right I do! Now, get this turd-filled sack off Oh, my God, it just went back in my body. Hey, look, what's wrong with Peter? Oh, you smell that? He's passed out drunk. Does no one in this house have any dignity? Hey, Lois, I'm home from the Clam, and I'm horny. Hmm. Seems like reverse time did that kid a favor. I'm not so sure about that. Stand up! You're gonna break that thermometer! My God, it's it's extraordinary. They all seem to be completely unaware that anything is amiss. ""Your trash barrels were a little close ""to our driveway. Joe. ""P.S. Please close the windows ""when you're giving piano lessons. My legs don't work, but my ears do."" Brian, what are you doing staring in Quagmire's window? Man, watching sex in reverse is just bizarre. God, where does Quagmire meet these women? This is why Boxbuster went out of business. Hey, what's going on over there? My God, look at all this devastation! What the hell happened? Okay, Seamus, today's the day you finally ask out that barista. What's the worst that could happen? You know, that chicken's kid is in my preschool class. I don't really want to be friends with him, but he knows a lot of chicks. And backwards rim shot. Oh, Brian, this is gonna be more difficult than I thought. Damn it, I hate these new stairs! What are you watching? Meet the Press; it's really weird. In reverse time, the Republicans make outrageous statements and then the host asks an unrelated question. Global warming is a myth. God created everything, and the world is getting colder! What is your tax plan? That's odd. What? Man, we got a large number of clovers on our lawn. No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh, hey, Cleveland. Australia, here I come. Look at that, Brian. Cleveland is back living across the street. Cleveland left Quahog quite some time ago, yet we only just recently entered reverse time. So what does that mean? Well, it suggests that time may not simply be flowing backwards; it may, in fact, be accelerating. Accelerating? Why would that be happening? I'm not sure. Have you ever heard of a phenomenon called time dilation, Brian? Sure. No, you haven't. Time dilation, in forward time, is a phenomenon caused by a variety of factors in which time moves more slowly. In reverse time, it stands to reason that the same phenomenon would cause time to accelerate. I'll have to consult my quantum calculations to try to isolate the factors responsible. What the hell was that? This is more intense than when I fought a rabbit in that karate tournament. That's weird. You're doing reverse cutaways now? What the hell is What? What's the matter? Dear God, I'm un-teething. Brian, it appears the flow of reverse time is beginning to affect us as well. What does that mean? It means I'm going to have to relive everything. Every painful, awkward moment. Like that time I forgot what came after ""G"" and had to fake it.  A, B, C, D, E, F, G  H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P  Ah-blah, blah-blah, blah-nah-wah   Q, R, S, T, U, V  Standing here with these kids   W, X, Y and Z  Waiting for the song to end   Now I know my A-B-Cs  Yankee Doodle went to town  Next time won't you sing with me?   Now I know my A-B-Cs. What the devil is that? It's Peter and Chris. Sounds like they're in trouble. My God, why is there vomit everywhere? Is that the Ipecac bottle? Oh, no. No, please, not this. Oh, God, it's not gonna be coming out of us; it's gonna be going Oh, dear God Aah! What the hell? I don't wanna! I don't wanna! Dad, I'm scared. Oh, God, this is so disgusting. I think I'm gonna puke. Stewie, I don't care what it takes. We have got to fix this. We just ate so much vomit. Brian, it gets worse. Look. Yeah, Bonnie's pregnant with Susie. So? That means Susie's been un-born. Oh, my God. Stewie, you're not that much older than Susie. Brian, if we don't find a way to push time forward again soon, I, too, shall be un-born.  You've got  The AIDS. That guy's gonna feel so much better after we do what we got planned. How much time do we have before you're un-born? With the time acceleration, I'm not quite sure. But trust me, I can feel myself getting younger. All right. The machine has been repaired. Now all I've got to do is isolate the cause of the acceleration curve and see if I can duplicate the shock wave. What's the matter? I've regressed to my pre-ambulatory stage. I can no longer walk! My God, Stew, you look terrible. Brian, I suddenly feel as if I've just been through some sort of major trauma. Uh-oh. I think I know what that major trauma was. My birth. Dear God, I've got to get out of here! Oh, he's so cute. Oh, my God, we're getting closer to the beginning. You're Lacey Chabert. Oh, boy, a baby. I saw my Spanish teacher leave one of you in a trash can. Brian, help! Stewie, what do I do? He's gorgeous, isn't he? I want to be the baby! Look at that head. Well, Lois, this kind of completes your little carnival here. Hey, little guy. You ever need white, corner-of-the-mouth stuff, you come to your grandpa. Stewie, this is your new home. Brian, help! It's up to you. You've got to restore the flow of time. My life depends on it! What? Stewie, I don't know how to fix that machine. Trust me, you can do it. You're so talented in so many ways. Like what? Like You Just write down however you think you're talented, and I'll sign it. Well, it's up to you, buddy. Save this marriage. Oh, my God, it's the greased-up deaf guy running backwards toward that grease truck explosion. Oh, the grease burns so bad! I can't hear! Boy, I am late for that meeting. Come on, math, you dick. Come on, Brian. All right, think, think. What do I do? What do I do? All right, could it be as simple as this? ""Invert time flow."" Ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah. Oh, he's perfect. Come on, Brian, hurry. It's a girl! With a penis and no vagina. No! I think I can hear the ocean. Smell it, too. All right, what do I do? Wait a minute, what did I do before? That's all I have to do, right, is duplicate the circumstances, but do it the opposite way. All right, I was standing right here, the machine was on, I broke the glass and I turned the gauge backward. Maybe if I turn it in the other direction. Ooh, a quarter. Who cares what that doctor found on my nuts? This is a good day. It worked. I don't believe it. It worked. Brian, there you are. Where have you been? Meg, where's Stewie? Stewie? Who's Stewie? Here it comes. Push, Mrs. Griffin. You know what? I take it back, those panties are gonna be in the way. Okay, here comes the baby. Bloody hell! It's a boy. Oh, thank God. Oh, he's so beautiful. Mrs. Griffin, your husband's standing right here. What should we name him? I kind of like Brian's name: Stewie. That's a wonderful name, Brian. Stewie. Hi, Stewie. You did it, Brian. I've got to say, I didn't think you were gonna be able to pull it off, but you did it. You saved my life. And for that, I shall be forever grateful. Hey, I couldn't imagine life without you, buddy. You know, I forgot what a man cave I had in Lois's uterus. While I was waiting for you, I was shooting pool. Had to hold the cue at weird angles, but still. Oh, Peter, isn't he amazing? Is he smart, or is he like me? He's perfect. You guys heard the baby talking in there, didn't you? Chris, that's ridiculous."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker. This just in: Wanted fugitive, Bobby ""The Shirt"" Briggs, notorious for always wearing shirts while committing his crimes, has finally been caught after 15 years on the lam. A police spokesperson was quoted as saying, ""Duh, I'm a dumb cop. I like to give Tom Tucker a ticket."" I was going, like, 41. Oh, my God, I don't believe it. They finally got that son of a bitch, Briggs. You know that guy? You're damn right, I do. Bobby Briggs is the one who put me in this wheelchair. They got him. They finally got him. Geez, Joe, you okay? Here, use my handkerchief. It's wet and cold. Well, yeah, it's my handkerchief. I've been blowing my nose in it all day. Wait a minute, Bobby Briggs is the one who crippled you? You always told us you fell off a roof during a fight with the Grinch. I lied. I lied because I was ashamed of the real story: that I let a vicious criminal get away. What happened? Well, it was 1996. Briggs was one of the biggest heroin dealers east of Providence, which is mostly just open water, but still, I'd been undercover, tracking his operation for six months and had finally gained his confidence. I had almost gathered enough evidence to put Briggsaway for good, but I knew a taped confession would make the case a slam dunk. This is gonna take us to the next level. We're gonna be banging so many hot chicks with jeans up to their navels. Bobby Briggs, you're really good at heroin. How much heroin is here, Bobby Briggs? Why are you talking like that? Are you wearing a wire? Oh, you're dead, Joe Swansonson. My undercover name was Swansonson. Easy, Briggs. You kill a cop, they'll put you away forever. Then get ready to spend the rest of your life as a lame gimp with an annoying-voiced wife. He'd met Bonnie. Briggs got away, and I've been in this wheelchair ever since. I like that you can tell me a story starting at the Clam and ending on a Ferris wheel. Yeah, people are starving in Africa, and I'm at a carnival with my best buddies on a beautiful night. Blessings. Blessings. So, Joe, it must feel great to finally have some closure with Bobby Briggs. Yeah. You know last night was the first time in 15 years I didn't strangle Bonnie in my sleep? Okay. Hey, Dad, you're gonna want to see this. Again recapping our breaking news, longtime fugitive Bobby Briggs has escaped from police custody. His whereabouts are currently unknown. News of Briggs's escape first broke on Telemundo, if you can believe that. Escapo! Escapo! Escapo! Briggs reportedly escaped during a prison open house, an event that will most likely be canceled in the future. No, no! I can't believe it. Oh, don't worry, Joe, they'll get him back. No, they won't! It took 15 years to catch him. Well, this seems like a good time to be heading out. I should be getting back anyway. I left Rupert with a sitter. Well, you know where everything is. Feel free to help yourself to anything in the fridge. And Mr. Con Man here can have pudding or ice cream, not both. Chief, can I have a word? Yeah, but first, you have to agree there's a huge difference between bisexual men and homosexual men. Sure, Chief. Thank you. Huge. What is it? Well, Chief, I'm here because I want you to put me on the Briggs case. Absolutely not. Come on, Chief! I know everything about Briggs. I'm the only one who can catch him. No, Swanson, you're too close to the case. I'm putting Officers Grant and Casey on it because they're so far from the case, they don't care about it at all. Hi, Chief. Hi. This isn't fair! Swanson, you know your assignment. You get me the guy who's been rubbing his butt all over Dunkin' Donuts. Can I help you? Not illegal. Not illegal. Show me the law. Not illegal. Hey, Joe, look, I know you're down about this Briggs thing, and that kind of bums me out, so I got you this Cookie Puss. Isn't that funny? Look at that weird nose. I think your nose is weird. Guys, I'm telling you, I I just don't think I could live with Briggs on the lam for another 15 years. Well, why don't you do something about it? I can't do anything about it. The chief won't let me. Joe, if they don't find this guy, it's gonna eat you alive for the rest of your life. You got to take matters into your own hands. You got to go after this guy. But that's a breach of police protocol. This isn't about you as a cop. This is about you as a man. Come on, what do you say? Quagmire and I will help you bring this guy to justice. Peter, what did I say about you volunteering me for? All right, let's do it! Well, if you're gonna do it, you're gonna need someone who's very good at disguise. Who said that? I'd love to go with you, but I can't. I'm supposed to be the gift table at a Bar Mitzvah tomorrow. All right, if we're gonna go after Briggs, this might be a good place to start. I've spent the last 15 years gathering information on him, and it's all here. Every crime he's committed, every associate he's Oh, look, Briggs was All-County JV swimming. Well, I don't just focus on the negative. Joe, your 25-year-old son and your baby daughter share a room just so you can keep a weirdo Beautiful Mind room? Isn't that a little bizarre? And then we dug the bullets out of that Iraqi family's skulls so they couldn't be traced back to us. Today, I saw a balloon. Briggs' FBI profile says the only relationship he's maintained over the years is with a stripper named Tanya. Tax records show she currently works at a club in Atlantic City. So that's our first stop. Is there touching at the club? I-I-I don't know, Peter. Maybe. Okay, this is good, this is good. I'll be sure to pack my blamming jeans. Hey, listen, thanks for agreeing to take care of Principessa while we're gone, Lois. It's our pleasure. She looks like a nice kitty. Uh, kitty? Lois, she is a purebred Persian. I can trace her lineage to the cats kept by Cleopatra. Just tell me what I need to do, Glenn. Well, first, she has a very active bowel. You can't be too generous with the baby wipes. Stroke front to back like you would on yourself. Otherwise, you're smashing feces into her genitals. Also, she's very skittish, so you have to touch her like this. I'm going to touch you now. Is that okay? See how I'm going? Slowly, slowly. Oh, the mysteries you keep inside of you. Quagmire, come on, let's go. All right, I guess we're off. Hey, you guys, check out the look on Lois's face when I do this. Peter! Clean that up, you idiot! Love you. Boy, it'll be satisfying to finally slap the cuffs on Briggs once and for all. Hey, you ever just drive through a town and wonder, ""Who the hell lives here?"" All the time. Look at this place. I mean, what-what's going on? There's an adult with a lemonade stand. That Chinese restaurant still has the sign from when it was a mechanic. I don't want to eat lo mein where they were just changing mufflers. There's an apartment above that Arby's. With toys in the window. Someone has built a life up there. What a mess. I'm telling you, the Founding Fathers would be very disappointed in where their country ended up. Eh, it wasn't so perfect back then, either. And so I say unto you, sons of liberty, no longer will free men live under the yoke of giant predatory birds. Shrieking, swooping down, stealing our livestock. What's going on in here? N-Nothing, uh, just bellyaching about the British. Get back to warming those eggs.  All right, this is the place. We got to see if we can find Briggs's girl. Hey, we're looking for a stripper named Tanya. She here tonight? Yeah, she's working the Champagne Room. Follow me. Hey, Quagmire, you, uh you ever been to Atlantic City before? Once, about 20 years ago. Why? All right! All right! All right! All right! Hey, are you Tanya? Yeah. Who are you? A guy who's looking for Bobby Briggs. Where is he? I don't know any Bobby Briggs. And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. You're lying! Joe, let me handle this. I know how to communicate with strippers. All I need is one dance, and I'll know everything she knows. You free for a dance? Sure. I need information. I was molested by my dad. I know that. I need other information. I want you to tell me where I can find Bobby Briggs. Come on, you know I can't give out a client's personal information. All right, I'm gonna have to do the Vulcan V-Meld.  He lives at 2820 Ocean Boulevard, across from the park, apartment two. Atta girl. Okay, now spit in your own mouth. This is a cool place. Boy, it sure is nice having Mr. Quagmire's cat around. I got to say, cats are so much better than dogs. Well, that's kind of a broad statement. It's true. Okay, show me one way in which cats are better than dogs. Well, okay, uh, for one thing, they always land on their feet. Watch. So? Big deal. Dogs do that, too. Here, go ahead, do what you just did, but with me. Ow! Oh, my God! Oh, my neck! Ow! Oh, my God, Brian! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Call somebody! Oh! We need one of those boards they use for football players! Ow! Hey, what's going on? Nothing. I just figured out why cats are better than babies. Well, that's kind of a broad statement. Okay, 2820 Ocean, this is it. All right, apartment number two. We'll just pick the lock. What? What is that? Let's use our eyes to see. Aw, this guy has sugar cereals. His mom must be so cool. And he's got a trash compactor. It compacted it all. That is so boss. Aha! We meet again, Briggs. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who are you? Joe Swanson. Who? Wait, you you don't remember me? I infiltrated your heroin operation. We saw Reality Bites together. You guys, I found him! He went that way! Damn it. That's Lois. If I don't get this, she's going to kill me. Hi, sweetie. Yeah, everything's great. Of course, I miss you. Well, how does the supermarket run out of parsley? I'm as angry as you are. Peter, I'm going to fall! It looks like you're out of roof. Damn it. There's no way across. Spidey, can you swing us across with your web? No, I can't swing you across. And it's Spider-Man, not Spidey. I'm pretty sure I've heard people call you Spidey. Yeah, close friends. What's your name? Peter. Hey, Petey, do stuff for me. Oh, I don't like that. Yeah, you don't like it. And you're a fat nobody, and I'm  Spider-Man, so how do you think I feel? He's getting away. Guys, drop me over the side! Are you crazy, Joe?! That fall will kill you. Not if I land on my legs. Heads up. I got you now, Briggs. Move that bus! Enjoy your new home. He's gone, you guys! I had him! That was our one chance! It's all right, Joe. You got nothing to be ashamed of. You're a great cop with a very distinguished career. You caught that guy who was killing all those Filipino girls. Yeah, but this was important! This was the guy who ruined my life. The one perp who meant everything to me. If I caught this guy, I'd finally be able to sleep at night. Damn it! Oh, thank God. Cops. Oh, good. You guys can still catch Briggs. He's headed that way. We're not here for him. We're here for you guys. You're under arrest for interfering with a police investigation. What? Yeah, what the hell? You should be out there arresting the real criminals. Like switchblade-wielding white guys from movies and TV who don't talk like people talk. Easy, mama. Hand over that purse, and everything will be real cool, you dig? Guys, you got to let us out of here. The real criminal's getting away. Yeah, the bastard's making a break for it, just like South America. Hmm. Lot of black guys over there. Hey, man, where you going? I'll be back. I'm coming back. I'll be right back. Why would the cops arrest us instead of going after Briggs? Flannigan? Wait a minute. That's one of the corrupt cops who helped harbor Briggs while he was on the lam for 15 years. These guys are bad news. Oh, my God. What are they going to do to us? We're not going to stick around to find out. Joe, hold your handcuffs over my lap. What the hell is that? Swiss Army penis. Wow, Quagmire. That's incredible. Peter? Yours are made of a stronger metal. We're going to have to go with the acetylene torch penis. Don't don't look right at it. My STDs help it burn brighter. The keys are in the ignition. Let's go! I told you to search that guy's penis. You say that about everybody. Yeah, we did it! But we lost Briggs. How are we going to find him now? We got nothing. Well, I don't know if it helps, but I found this number next to the phone in his kitchen. I was saving it 'cause I was going to make a scrapbook of the trip for you guys. Let me see that. This is the area code for Juarez, Mexico. He's trying to get over the border! You think so? Definitely. There's only one road into Juarez, and it goes through El Paso. We got to get to El Paso. Joe, how do you know the area code for Juarez, Mexico? There was a stem cell doctor I went down there to see. He just rubbed, like, salsa on my legs. Hey, you're not in uniform. Are you guys cops? Are you guys cops? They know we're not cops! All right, guys, the next flight to El Paso leaves in 40 minutes. But Briggs is ahead of us. Won't he already be there? No, he'd never risk going through an airport. Too many cops, too many cameras, too much security. I don't know, Joe. Sometimes the security's pretty lax. I mean, the last plane I was on got gay-jacked. This plane's going to Miami! Hey, Lois? Shh. Quiet, Brian. Mom's taking a nap on the couch. Yeah. And look, she fell asleep with the cat right on her chest. Isn't that cute? Meow. Purr. Purr. I think you're dreaming. No, I'm not. Stupid cat! God, it's so damn hot. Hey, I got an idea. Let's make scalding asphalt angels. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Second-degree burns; first-degree fun. Geez, how long we got to stand out here like this? Till Briggs comes through. You know, I was thinking about that, Joe. If Briggs is driving here, that's like 2,000 miles. It's going to be at least a couple of days. Huh. I guess you're right. Well, what are we going to do for two days in El Paso? There's a Chicano heritage festival. No way. KC and the Sunshine Band is playing. Why? Or we could visit the Pershing House where John Pershing took control of the Eighth Army Brigade in 1914. So, that's his bed? Yes. So, that's his desk? Yes. So, that's his lamp? Yes. So, that's his dresser? Yes. So, that's his window? Yes. So, that's his floor? Yes. Wow. What do you got there, Quagmire? Is that Briggs? No, this guy's clean. Well, send him through. What's the holdup? Sombreros! Maracas! Ceramic Winnie the Pooh dolls! Get 'em now, folks! You're not going to find this stuff in Mexico! Come on. What's going on up there? Briggs. Damn it! He's getting away! You're not going to get away this time, you son of a bitch. Please, don't kill me. I'm not married. My life is awesome. I've waited 15 years for this moment, Briggs. Do you have any idea what it's like to have to lift yourself into a wheelchair every morning? To have your wife look at you like you're half a man? To get preferential parking? To board a plane early with the first-class people and gold card members? All right, it's not all bad. But I'm not going to kill you. I'm not an animal like you. So, what are you going to do, arrest me? No. I don't arrest cripples. By the way, you're under arrest. I only said that last thing 'cause it seemed cool. Oh, my God, that was so awesome. I saw everything. You were all like And Briggs was all like And then you were all like And then Briggs's legs were like Oh, crap, he's dead. I think he bled out. I must have hit the femoral artery. Ah, just kick him into Mexico. Guys, I can't thank you enough for what you did. You risked your lives for me, and I couldn't have done it without you. Hey, that's what pals are for. Yeah, and thanks for letting me fire a few rounds into Briggs's corpse. That was the most powerful I've felt in a couple years. Well, you guys helped me finally have some closure in my life. I feel like a new man-- like I'm reborn. Joe, you have blood just pouring out of your pant leg. Yeah, I had a ball blow in the river."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Family Guy 11x06 All right, I'm going to the store. Anybody need anything? Yeah, can you get me a chess set and a backwards hat? I got some inner-city school kids I gotta inspire tomorrow. Okay, Darius, point to the king. That's right. It's you. Hey, Lois. Doesn't, uh, somebody have a birthday coming up this week? Oh, it's nice of you to remember, Brian, but, frankly, I'd rather let this one slip by. I don't need to be reminded how old I'm gettin'. You know, it's funny. You keep so busy with your kids, time just seems to slip away, and then you turn around one day and Okay, bye. Stop making noise. You know, Peter, I know Lois is downplaying it, but I think she might actually appreciate it if we threw her a party. Maybe even a surprise party. That's a great idea, Brian! Yeah, I love parties. I mean, I had a great time at my baby shower. Well, after opening all these gifts, I could use a little wine right now myself. Glug, glug, glug, glug. Can you imagine?! I'm sorry. My hormones are just crazy right now! Stewie, you want a Mommy rocket ride? What? What do you mean? Here we go! Get ready for blastoff! Ow! Son of a bitch! Oh, my God, Stewie, are you all right? Nice throw, Casey Anthony. Oh, my God, I hope the guys at Sears portrait studio will be able to retouch this. What am I saying? Of course they will. They're Sears. What the deuce? Well, hello there. I say, you're a cute little fellow. Tell me something: What do you think about Rose McGowan? Yeah, she makes my turtlehead go in, too. How about Michelle Rodriguez? Yeah, me too, kinda, right? You know, she's got like a cute tomboy thing where you feel like you could play softball with her, and then later on, give her the old sau-seege. I like you. I can tell we're going to be good friends. We've got that unspoken bond that all bald guys have. I thought he'd never leave. Me neither. Yeah. Aw, did you guys just do the thing? Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye. All right, you guys, that was Lois. She's gonna be here in ten minutes. Dad, how did you get Mom out of the house so we could decorate? Well, Chris, I constructed a very elaborate fake grocery store. Oh, my God! Are these pickles really only 39 cents?! That's right, ma'am. Wow! This is incredible! What the hell's going on here? And over here are my toys. This is my fire truck, my Slinky, my Silly Putty. You know, Silly Putty's awesome, but you know what's really cool? Serious Putty. Oh, this looks like fun! It says I have cancer. We thought it would be better if you heard it from chemicals in an egg. Hey, Stewie, you better come down. The party's about to start. What is that? Is that a turtle? Yes, Brian. I found him at the park. I named him Sheldon. Oh, and get this: I brought him home today, and coincidentally this is the day Rupert started working out again. So transparent. Rupert? What happened to your eye? Brian, did you pull one of Rupert's eyes off? No. Why would I do that? Maybe your turtle did it. Nonsense. Sheldon is a gentle soul. He wouldn't hurt anybody. Well, come on. Let's get downstairs. Lois will be here any minute. Surprise! Yay! Birthday! Oh, my God! Happy birthday, Lois! You guys shouldn't have done this! Hey, anytime you can celebrate the end of someone's periods. Everyone, everyone, I have something to say. To my dearest Lois on her birthday. What a journey we've had together. You know, life has a way of changing things. What were once two firm, impressive mountain peaks have become a barren, strip-mined, muddy landslide that droops ever downward. What were once pink and succulent rose petals now take the form of the shredded, raggedy, blown-out endpiece of a practical joker's exploding cigar. Peter, that- that's enough. Lois, you may not be the young filly you were when I met you, but you're still my reliable old plow horse who's there each day to pull the plow, to help around the barn, and let the husband horse-slap a batch at her now and then. Well, I guess that's it. I love you, sweetheart. And I have a lovely gift of the batchslapping variety waiting for you when I'm just the right amount of drunk. To Lois! To Lois! Lois! Mom! Geez, what the hell's her problem? Peter, she was already feeling insecure about her age, and then you went and gave her that horrible speech! I don't blame her. Nobody likes to be humiliated in public. I'm King Stewie! I rule with an iron fist! La, la-la, la-la la-la! Look at me! Ooh! In my office. Now. Hey, any of you guys seen your mother? She never came to bed last night, and I can't find her anywhere. What the hell?  Hey, sluts! OMG, stop staring at me, please-'kay-thanks. Mom, are you okay? Lois, what's goin' on? I'm what's goin' on, Peter. I got highlights, I went shopping, and I had my So it's tighter now. Peter, I think Lois might be having a midlife crisis. Come on, dudes! Who wants to hop in my wheels and head to the beach for some ultimate Frisbee? Yeah, Sheldon, I'm with you. I can't I can't do that. Hey, tweeps! JK, I don't follow you, you're lame. But look who just got herself a sick new tat. Oh, my God, Mom! I know, I can't believe it either. I guess one of my flaws is I'm just kinda brave. No, that's great actually, because now anyone walking behind you will know that you had $60. Wow! That is awesome, Lois! Your bum looks like an NBA guy's arm. 'Cept it's not payin' someone to install a PlayStation in a car. Lois, you do know that's permanent? Good. Then that means my ass is gonna look young forever. Guys, I, uh, I gotta go shoot one into the sink. What's going on? Mom's acting and dressing like a 20-year-old. I know, and I'm worried about her. You can't just pretend to be something you're not. Yes, just ask Edward Scissorhands. Okay, now, I'm an excellent night nurse, so you two get some much-deserved sleep and don't worry about a thing. I will take such loving care of this wonderful little gift. And when you wake up, well-rested, your precious little baby will be smiling as bright as the sun. It's dead. And while I remind you I can't read yet, I can only imagine Madeline would say, ""Take me out of this disgusting French hospital and find me some real parents."" Ah! Paper cut! A razor blade?! Who the hell uses a razor blade as a bookmark?! All right, very funny, Stewie. What? What do you mean, what? You replaced my Jack Daniels with flat Diet Coke. No, I didn't. And you're noticing this at 8:20 in the morning? What has happened to your life? Do you need to talk? Just stay away from my booze! It wasn't me, Brian. Well, if it wasn't you, who was it? I mean, there's a lot of weird stuff going on around here lately. Just yesterday, somebody gave Peter a ""hotbutt.""  La, la, la, la, la, regular life   La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, l  And then somebody replaced Meg's sleeping pills with Alka-Seltzer. People are gonna miss me when I'm Well, I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for those things. Sometimes you just Whoa, that was close. Yeah, how'd that thing fall over? Okay, who replaced my glasses with forks? I mean, they're real good for seeing forks but not much else. Peter, can you come down to the laundry room? Ugh, son of a bitch. If she washed my belt again, I am gonna hit her with my dry, withered belt. What is it, Lois? I was watching Whoa, Lois, what the hell are you doing? Do me, Peter, do me right here in the basement. Y-You mean this room we're in or your bum? No, this room, Peter, right here on the carpet. Oh, so you mean the front. Just get over here and kiss me. Let's have sex on all the clean, folded laundry. Wow, Lois, I got to say, I like this new you. I like it a lot. Oh, Peter! Oh, Peter, yes! Yeah. Oh, I'm on fire. Yeah. Take me, you filthy bastard. Yeah, oh. Destroy me and this laundry. Oh, yeah. Yeah, here, put Meg's bra in your mouth. Oh, my God, that's so disturbing. I know, gross. Yeah, and my hearing's a lot better, so I hear, like, suction and stuff.  ""All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die""   Says the man next to me out of nowhere   The good people of the world  Are washing their cars on their lunch break   Hosing and scrubbing as best they can   In skirts and suits  They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks   Back to the phone company, the record store, too   Well, they're nothing like Billy and me   'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun   I got a feeling I'm not the only one   All I wanna do is have some fun   I got a feeling I'm not the only one   All I want to do is have some fun   Until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard.  Sheldon. What are you doing? Get back in your bowl where you belong. Well, long as I'm up, I might as well go spit in Lois's mouth. Sheldon? Come on, Stewie. He's just a little turtle. He can't hurt you. Get out! Isn't this epic, Peter? That DJ has got some mad skills. You think they sell Anacin at the bar? Come on. Get up and dance with me, Peter. This place is sick. Hells yeah! It is the only rooftop pool in Providence. No offense, but this place is awesome. I-I-- Where was I supposed to be offended within that remark? Can we, can we leave, Lois? Actually, we are leaving. We're hitting another insane party across town. What, you mean now? Peter, you sound like an old fart. I thought you liked having a hot, young wife. Well, I did at first, but the novelty's worn off. Same thing happened with that blog I started on 9/11. Look, Peter, you do what you want to do, but I'm going to that party. My life isn't over. It's just beginning. So if you don't want to run with the wild horses, then go back to the barn and go to bed. But, Lois Stupid place still doesn't have my dry cleaning. That's not a dry cleaners. It's a dance club. It is? Well, that explains a lot. Oh, this is my jam! Jeez, Peter, you look terrible. I know. Lois has been wearing me out. I just can't keep up with her. I don't know what she's trying to prove, Brian, but I can't take it anymore. Peter, can't you see? She's doing this because of you. For God's sake, you called her a plow horse. It's no wonder she's trying to prove she's young and vibrant. Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker. The city of Quahog has been stricken with a case of Bieber Fever tonight, as teen idol and fake black guy Justin Bieber is in town for a sold-out show at the Quahog Civic Center. We now go live to Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa with more. Tom, I'm standing here at the Quahog Civic Center, awash in a pool of prepubescent sexual moisture. Woo-hoo! We love you, Justin! Look! That's Mom! Oh, my God! What the hell? She's at a Justin Bieber concert? Ugh, Justin Bieber's so yesterday. I'm all about Quentin Vashay now. Who's Quentin Vashay? Exactly. What's going on? Do we have to get a new mom now? No, Chris. I'm gonna go get our old mom back. If I'm the one who made her feel this way, then I'm the one who's got to fix it. Brian, keys! Chris, beer! Meg, ugly! Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes, I see. Rupert, the man from the newspaper would like a quote from you about my dancing abilities. Rupert? Where'd you go? Magnolia Cupcakes? Rupert! Oh, my God! Oh, my God, no! If he did this to you, I swear I'll kill him! And what's that box from Bloomingdale's doing here? I, uh, I-I don't know who this is. Oh, my God, he is so adorable. I could just bite him and eat him up. I know, he's perfect. He's like a boy and a girl. I know! Sorry, you're not allowed in here. Oh, yeah? I'm not into that. Oh. Well, what are you into? Pinkberry. I love my job. Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. Hey, there, cutie. Oh, hey. How's it going? Um, are you a friend of my mom's? Yeah. I'm your mom's friend, Mrs. Robinson. I don't I don't get that. Is that a reference to something? Uh, okay. Uh, I'm, uh-- oh, I'm Stifler's mom. Still no idea. Okay, just get your pants off, hon. Stop right there! Get away from her! Peter?! Who are you? How'd you get in here? Step away from my wife, you acorn-penised beauty! Look, I swear. Nothing happened. Just relax, old man. Old man?! What, you think you're not gonna get old, you little bastard?! And, Lois, I've had enough of you, too! Now, you come home and start acting your age! No, Peter. I don't want to act my age, and you don't want that either. Otherwise, you wouldn't have called me an old plow horse. Look, I didn't mean to say that. I-I was a jerk. But isn't this what you want? Don't you want me to stay young and exciting? Well, I thought I did. I mean, every guy who's been married a while thinks he wants a hot, young chick, but after you spend an hour with one of them, you want to blow your brains out. But, Peter, I was just doing this to make you happy. You do make me happy, Lois. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. That's sweet. But you got to admit, I'm not what I used to be. Well, neither am I. I used to be a lion tamer. Look, Lois, I'll always treasure the wild, little hottie I met when I was young. But I don't want to be with a kid anymore. I want a smart, sexy, beautiful, middle-aged companion. I want the real Lois. My Lois. Oh, Peter. Mr. Bieber, they're calling for an encore! Oh, my God, those kids are expecting a show. I'll handle this. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Bieber.  People see us everywhere  They think you really care  But myself I can't deceive  I know it's only make-believe  Well, well, look who has surfaced. You're getting colder. Hey, get out here and fight me! Damn it! Now batting: Stewie Griffin! Oh, crap. Ugh, you look like a nude Larry David. No, no, no! Oh, my God, Super Mario? What are you doing here? I jump on a turtle, Stewie. It's not an exciting life, but it's my life. It sure is good to have you back, Mom. Yeah, we missed you. Well, thanks for putting up with me, you guys. Sorry I got so flipped out about my age. Aw, don't worry about it, Lois. But from now on, remember: I love you just the way you are. And besides, there's nothing wrong with being 35. Peter, I'm 43. Get out of this house."

Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  There he is. The reason my bedpost is so shiny. Oh my God. Are you still obsessed with Kent? Just ask him out already. The worse that can happen is he says no. Are you kidding? Of course he'll say no. There's no way he'd ever go out with me. He's just so dreamy. Oh Kent, what are we gonna do? With the Earth destroyed, we're the only two humans left. Well then, it looks like we need to start repopulating.  Meg and Kent are having space sex   We can't show it  But that's what's happening. I think she's choking. Should we wake her up? No, she's got to learn to breathe out of her nose. She's getting it. Peter, you want another waffle? I can't Lois. I promised Janice I'd take her shift. Can I get two eggs, scrambled, on toast? Sure thing, honey. Adam and Eve on a raft, wreck them! I'd like a hotdog with ketchup and some Jell-O, please. Paint a bow-wow red and a side of nervous pudding! Can I have a well-done burger with lettuce and tomato? Burn one, drag it through the garden, pin a rose on it! Can I use your bathroom? Got a telephone pole heading to the swimming hole. Spray it with sunshine! Psst. Hey, dog. What? You want in? Yeah. Ah, look at this. She's taped photographs of Virginia Woolf and Katy Perry on the inside cover, as if she's some sort of hip hybrid of those two things. Ugh. Yeah, like she could ever write Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Brian, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was not written by Virginia Woolf. Yeah, obviously. But, you know, it's-it's pretty much about her. It really isn't, Brian. Let's, uh, let's just get into this, huh? ""Dear Diary, got down to 152 today. Think that's a nice weight for me."" Oh, here's another one. ""Dear Diary, just discovered the music of John Denver. Wow-wee, where's this been?"" Hey, look at this. ""Kent is so incredibly sexy. ""He said 'hi' to me today, and I almost died. ""Also, I learned a funny lesson today in my pursuit of Kent: anal bleaching is better left to professionals. LOL."" Oh, oh! No, no, no, come on, now, come on. Jeez, it's just pages and pages of stuff about this Kent guy. She's really obsessed with him. Well, obsession's not such a bad thing. It got us the first printing press. You're a whore, Sheila, and I'm gonna make sure everybody knows it! Here! I can't read. No one can read. Bye, Patty. Bye, Esther. Bye, overzealous Asian kids lining up to be the first ones in school tomorrow. Go away. No time to say ""bye."" I pass you 'cause you lose focus! Damn! Lost focus! Life over! Oh, Kent, this is all I ever wanted. I feel the same way, Meg. From today onward, this is our life. We should get off the horse soon. I want to save one for you. Oh, my God! Are you all right? I'm fine. Lucky for you, this tree was my destination. And the job exchange begins. Sir, do you want to move ahead on the agreement with the sanitation union? Sir, we need leadership. Oh, my God, Meg! Are you okay? Yeah, I-I'm fine. I guess I got distracted again thinking about Kent. Oh, I can't do this anymore. I've just got to ask him out. Sorry! Honey, give me any laundry you have. I'm doing a diapers and Meg load. Hey, Mom, can I ask you about something? Of course, Meg. What's on your mind? Well, there's this guy I like at school, and I was thinking about, I-I don't know, maybe calling him and Meg, are you asking, in this day and age, when the CEO of Xerox is a woman, when the president of Brazil is a woman, even Rosie O'Donnell is a woman, whether it's appropriate for a girl to ask a boy out on a date? Of course it's appropriate. It's also sad and desperate and I would never do it, but you're not me, are you, sweetie? No, I'm not. No, you're not. Hello? Hey, Kent? It's Meg, from English class. Uh And math class? And bio? And the Facebook campaign to get me to kill myself? Oh, Meg! Hey, what's up? Hey! Um, nothing much. I was just wondering if you maybe wanted to hang out some time? Sure. Oh, wow, cool! Okay, um, I'll-I'll text you? Yes! I can't believe it! Oh, my God, I'm going out on a date with Kent Lastname. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Oh, my gosh! I'm gonna go ahead and shut this for you. Oh, hello. Hi, you must be Mrs. Griffin. I'm Kent. I'm here to pick up Meg. Oh, Kent, it's so nice to meet you. She's just getting ready. Meg, Kent's here! Just putting on my lipstick. Damn it. And this is Meg's brother, Chris. Oh, yeah, I've seen you around school. You eat with the deaf kids, right? One of them isn't all the way deaf. What grade are you in again? That's still being worked out by a team of counselors. Cool. Hope to see you around school. He seems nice. Sorry, I missed all that. I was tweeting. Coming this fall, the prequel to Philadelphia. Are you sure we don't need a condom? No, it's okay, I'm a lawyer. How you girls doing on popcorn? I'll take some. Here you go. Oh, sorry, am I taking up the whole armrest? Boy, it's kind of chilly in here. Really? You got big sweat marks under your boobs. That must mean they must like you then. Hey, I'll be right back. I got to go to the bathroom. Oh, thank God. And now, our feature presentation: Adrien Brody Doing Sit-Ups in 3-D. One. Two. That was fun. We should hang out again some time. Yeah, definitely. Well, good night. Night. Oh, no, I'm sorry. Oh, my God, I thought you I didn't think this was a date. Oh, my God. I'm so embarrassed! Hey, it's 10:30! I suggest you take your dope and go elsewhere! I'm sorry, Meg. I think you're great, and I love hanging out with you, but there's something you should know. I'm gay. You are? Look, I really like you as a friend, but to be honest I like Chris. What? Oh, for God's sake. I have a shoe appointment in the morning, and I want to be fresh! Yeah, the person I'm attracted to is your brother. Brother? Rupert, did you hear that? Meg's boyfriend is in love with me. Not that I care. I mean, it won't matter once I explain to him what's going on with us. But what would I tell him is going on with us? Thanks, Brian! Brian? Hey princess. I'll get out of your hair. I can see you want to be left alone. Why does everything bad always happen to me? Huh, you and me both. I got this cold. And it's-it's just in that ""I don't want to give it to a friend"" stage, you know? Oh, God, you hear that? I sound like a Jewish See 'n Say. The uncle says The grandpa says What?! The aunt says Oh-h. Kent told me he's gay, and even worse, he likes Chris! Oh, wow, I'm really sorry to hear that, Meg. I don't get it. I've been going to high school with him for three years, and I always assumed he was straight. Well, high school's a tough time, Meg. Maybe he thought he was straight, but then realized he's gay. He's probably still figuring things out. Hang in there. Well, I'll help him figure things out. I'll help him figure out that he's straight. That was really close. Hey, Chris, you mind if I sit here? No, of course not. We were just having a political discussion. Bill's, uh kind of conservative. Hey, you know, it was really cool meeting you the other night. I was thinking maybe we should hang out sometime. Sure. I sleep for, like, six hours every day after school, but other than that, I'm pretty open. Well, great, then we should definitely Oh, hey, Meg. Listen, I hope you're okay after the other night. Yeah, no, that's-that's what I wanted to talk to you about, Kent. Look, I-I know you're going through a confusing time. The thing is, though, I feel like you're not actually gay. What? No, I-I told you, I am. You don't talk or act gay. I mean, you play football. Those jeans cost And you only use ""hello"" as a greeting, not as a way to outdo some imaginary antagonist in conversation. Meg, please stop. I know your heart's in the right place, but Actually, it's not. It's a serious medical condition. Yeah, that's that's not supposed to be there, so she should probably always wear a hat. Hey. Hey. So I guess you heard about Meg's boyfriend, huh? I did. I did hear, yes. Weird, right? Guy has a crush on her own brother. I know, so weird. But, you know, the heart wants what the heart wants. I just hope it doesn't cause awkwardness, you know, in the house. Oh, no, it doesn't have to be awkward, not if we don't make it awkward. I just don't see the attraction. I mean, is it all about that big package? Big? You really think so? Are you kidding? Biggest in the family. That thing should be hanging from the ceiling of a deli. Thanks, Brian. God, I have so much energy now. Am I the only one who feels like grabbing a drink? Hey, do you think this picture is hot? Kind of, yeah. Well guess what: that's my back. Hook up with me! Come on! We can make this work. Just stick your head in here and pretend it's a butt. No, Meg, stop it. God, this is getting too weird. I can't be your boyfriend. In fact, I don't even think I can be your friend. Kent, wait! We can totally be friends. We can go shopping together. And I like musicals. I've even seen the latest Tony Award-winning piece of crap.  If more people join in  The song will get better  If more people join in  The song will get better  If more people join in  The song will get better  If more people join in  The song will get better  Now you're having fun  'Cause we're in the aisles  Even the bad guy is singing along.  They're singing right near me, so it's a great musical. Hey, Meg, what's wrong? What's wrong is that Kent doesn't like me. He likes my brother, Chris. Oh, my God. No way! Well, I mean, you've done everything you can do. I guess you just have to move on. Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of sweet guy-trim at this school. You-you don't understand. He's all I think about. I-I can't eat, I can't sleep. Just thinking about him now gives me heart palpitations. I feel like if I could just know what it's like to be with him, just-just once, I could at least have some sort of closure. Well, if Kent hooks up with your brother, you could just have Chris describe every last detail to you. Oh, my God, that's it. What do you mean? I mean, if I can't have Kent, then that's the next best thing. I've just got to get Chris to sleep with him. Oh, no. Here comes Mr. Davis with one of his technically-not- illegal invitations. Girls, I'm gonna be at the park later. Oh, I wouldn't worry about it, Bonnie. I've put Stewie in the oven a bunch of times. As long as you come to your senses within 15 minutes, everything's fine. Lois, can I go Slip 'N Slide in the yard? Has it been half an hour since you've eaten? Yes. Almost. Okay, I just want to be sure you don't get a cramp. Yay! Poor people water fun! Hey, Chris. Uh, can I ask you a question? Sure, what's up? Um, remember that ""free hug"" coupon you gave me for my ninth birthday that I never used? Yeah. Well, I'd like to use it. Oh, okay. Sure. But I'd like to sort of upgrade it. I'd like it to be a butt-hug with Kent. What? Are you out of your mind?! Chris, please, just sleep with Kent and then tell me all about it. Forget it, Meg. I can't just do stuff with another guy. I'm not Derek Jeter. I like girls. Ugh, come on, Chris. Girls are terrible. They're always backstabbing and giving each other phony compliments. Oh, wow, you are definitely not afraid of dessert. You know, I wish I were secure enough to throw on any old thing and call it an outfit. Come on, you have so much body confidence. I mean, who wouldn't with those strong legs? So muscular. I'm jealous of how thick with strength they are. Hey, I like your tie. Thanks.  Come on, Chris, he'll do all the work. I said no, Meg. I'll pay you a hundred bucks. Oh, fine, I'll keep it in my bum. There'll be plenty of room. That's my sarcastic way of saying it's not gonna happen. Good day, Meg. Oh, it's gonna happen. Oh, hi, Meg. Hi, Mr. Quagmire. What can I do for you? I-I was wondering if I could borrow some roofies? Oh, sure, sure, just a sec. Roofies, huh? Pretty big pill for such a little girl. Yeah, I know, but I asked someone to do me a favor, and they're not too keen on doing it. Oh, I know what they're for, honey. So, how's school? Oh, good, thanks. Studies going well? Yeah, yeah, mostly A's and B's so far this semester. Oh, that's so great. Seeing anyone special these days? Hey, obviously, right? Of course, yeah. Okay, well, listen, good luck with everything. And, uh, call me if you get arrested. I will. Thanks. That's what it's all about, Glenn. Don't rape it back, rape it forward. All right, I talked to Chris, and he totally wants to hook up with you, too. No way! Really? I didn't even know he was gay. It's just that he's not as comfortable with his sexuality as you are yet, so he's gonna need to pretend to be asleep while it's happening. Oh, he's a snooze-juicer. Okay. Wow, I didn't know Chris had this dark side to him. Oh, yeah, Chris has a major dark side. My dad is actually really scared of him. Wha Who's there? Go back to sleep, Dad. Okay. You're very precious to me. Chris, I made some Kool-Aid! You want some? Sure! Chris, what are you doing in my room? Nothing. Yes, you were. You were putting something in my drawer. What's this? Look, Meg, I know you've been having a hard time lately, so I wanted to give you something that means a lot to me. Oh, I remember this. This was the trip our family took to the Cape. Ugh, it was miserable. It was raining, and Mom and Dad fought the whole time. You taught me how to hunt squirrels with poisoned cheese, and then you took me to the hospital when the squirrels tricked me into eating the cheese. Chris, you kept this photo all these years? Yeah, it's gotten me through a lot of tough times. Like when Felicity cut her hair. What?! Aw, thanks, Chris. That was really thoughtful of you. Hey, so can I have some of that Kool-Aid now? No. No, actually you can't. Oh, Chris, hi. I didn't realize you'd be awake. What? Well, Meg said you'd be asleep, but it's fine. I can work with this. Oh, hell no! Meg! Oh, my God. Kent, I just texted you that the plan was off. Meg, what the hell were you planning on doing?! Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry. I was so obsessed with Kent that I-I guess I wasn't thinking straight. I'm just glad I stopped before I did a really terrible thing. Terrible thing? What terrible thing? Well, like I said, I-I changed my mind. I-I didn't do it. But, um I was kind of gonna roofie you. What?! What is wrong with you?! And, Kent, I owe you an apology, too. I lied when I told you that Chris wanted to sleep with you. Save it, Meg! I don't need your apologies! I can see now that you're a complete psycho! Boy, clothes sure are a prison, aren't they? Lot of drumroll for nothing. What's this? Ooh, candy! Hey, Meg. I heard what happened. Yeah, Kent hates me now. You made a mistake. I know you feel terrible, but you're not a bad person, Meg. You just need to get back out there, and someday, maybe you'll find the right guy. You really think so, Brian? I know so. All it takes is one guy making one mistake, one drunken night. Sperm finding a fertile egg. You refusing to do what a sane woman would do. You got him, Meg. You got him for life. Thanks, Brian. No problem. Hey, do either of you know what poison ivy looks like?"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  We now return to 11 Angry Men and One Developmentally Disabled Man. Okay, the vote is and one for ""kitty."" All right, let's keep talking it out Has the jury reached its verdict? We have, Your Honor. We find the defendant kitty. Boy, am I beat. Peter, what's with the tie? Oh, I bought a tie so I can loosen it when I'm beat. Oh, my God, Dad! Peter, your breath! It's horrible. Is Whoopi Goldberg working out down there? Peter, I think what everyone's saying is that you've got ""dad breath."" What the hell's ""dad breath""? You know, ""dad breath."" Guys get older, they stop paying attention to hygiene, their bodies are changing It's just a fact that, at a certain age, men start to rot from the inside out. I don't smell it. Huh. Maybe that explains what happened with that new guy at work today. All right, so this is Pawtucket Patriot's national distribution. As you can see, we are predominantly an East Coast beer. Hey, there's gonna be a quiz on all this later. I'm just kidding. Someone said that to me once, now I say it. Hey, Lois, what do you say we do what Anderson Cooper tried once before he decided he hated it? Oh, Peter Hi, there. Ugh. Oh. Let's do some role-playing. You're you and I'm Peter, only with much worse knees. Ow, my knees! Actually, Peter, I think I finally want to make love to a 1950's spaceman. Really? You mean it?! All right, let's go! Good. Ugh, Dad, it smells like rotting flesh in here. Take the window lock off! Can't do that, Meg. I don't trust myself not to jump out the window.  But Minnie had a heart Ah, now this is music.  As big as a whale  Hidee hidee hidee hi  Hidee hidee hidee hi   Hodee hodee hodee ho  Hodee hodee hodee ho   Heedee heedee heedee hee  Heedee heedee heedee hee  Oh, my God! Meg, are you okay? Do you need mouth-to-nose resuscitation? Ah politics. Ah coach is a bum. Oh, bloody hell! Heh! Beetle Bailey. Heh! Ha-ha! Ha! Ha-ha-ha! Oh, that's it! All right, fat man, two can play at that game. Aah! Friendly fire! All right, that's it, Peter, we've got to do something about that awful breath. I'm making an appointment, and you are going to the dentist. Geez, you are not gonna let this go, are you? You're as stubborn as a four-hour erection. Well, she's long gone, so, uh, you can go, too. Oh, no, you got me for another three and half hours, pal. Go ahead, seek medical attention. I'm not going anywhere. You can't stay! I'm chaperoning my daughter's Girl Scout dinner in 45 minutes! Well, tuck me into your waistband and try not to pee up your shirt. Oh, boy. All right, I think I found the culprit. This shrimp was lodged under one of your gums. Wow, that must've been in there a while. It's been weeks since I ordered from Hurry Up, Shrimp. Where the hell is this guy? I ordered that shrimp two hours ago. Uh-oh! Looks like you should've ordered from Hurry Up, Shrimp. Hurry Up, Shrimp? Well, that just sounds fast. On average, Americans spend upwards of 50,000 hours waiting for shrimp over the course of their lives. When I heard that, I thought to myself, ""Why on earth don't these guys just hurry up?"" So that's just what we did. Come on! Come on! No way this is the shrimp. Wow, it is!  Hurry Up, Shrimp, Hurry up, Shrimp   Hurry Up, Hurry Up, Hurry Up, Shrimp.  Well, I'm very proud of you, Peter. And since you were so well behaved at the dentist, you can order anything you want. Oh, Dad, when do I get to go to the dentist? When you're older, Chris. Good evening, countrymen. - And women. - Oh! Welcome to The Founding Father. Hey, little guy. You know, that's a real treasure map you've got there. Okay, well, I guess treasure hunting isn't for everyone. Treasure, you say? Ah, yes. You see, legend has it that Quahog founder Miles ""Chatterbox"" Musket hid his fortune in fear of it being taken by British soldiers during the Revolutionary War. He died before he could retrieve it, and left behind only this map. Many believe his treasure is still buried right here in Rhode Island. Okay, I'm gonna go do diarrhea, and then I'll be right back to take your order. Lois, I know where this is! Peter, please, that's just a place mat to distract your children while you're eating. There's no treasure. Well, what if there is? Ah, see? Surprised you with that one. You see, you see that rock next to the ""X""? I know that rock, Lois-- it's right near Route 2. I'm finding that treasure. Peter, the map is a joke. You're being played for a fool. Like George McFly. Hey, Lorraine, whatever happened to that guy Marty from high school? Don't know. Never saw him after the prom. Really? Sure you didn't run into him, oh, say, about 16 years ago? George, what are you talking about? I'm talking about the fact that our son, who you insisted we name after that guy Marty, looks exactly like him! You think I'm an idiot? That I wouldn't notice that our son is a dead ringer for the guy who fixed us up? Mom, Dad, I accidentally set fire to the living room rug! I am not going easy on him! Hey, guys, who wants to dig for buried treasure with me? What? What are you talking about? Well, this child's place mat is telling me to dig for buried treasure by the side of the highway. Who's in? Aw, forget it, Peter. That's crazy talk. Yeah, we're not going along with another one of your stupid ideas. I don't have stupid ideas. Haven't you seen my documentary film? Each year, the environment covers more than 40% of the Earth. Every animal on Earth lays eggs. This is a birch tree. Today it will begin its 10,000-mile journey. The Earth neither hates nor loves, but sits, waiting patiently, for people to do famous stuff. Peter, it's time to come home. You been out here digging all day. I-I told you this whole thing was ridiculous. What the hell was I thinking, anyway? I must be some kind of idiot. What was that? Holy crap! Lois, it's the treasure! Oh, my God! Peter, you were right! Oh, no, it's the one kid who also followed the treasure map. I don't believe it! There really was something buried out there! Well, it's not the treasure, but it looks like it's a clue to where the treasure is. ""Face the circle in the square, you'll see me, I'll show you where."" Interesting. Interesting, interesting. Okay, well, if there is a treasure out there, we don't want anybody else to know about it. None of this leaves this room, okay? Obviously. We're not idiots, Brian. Hey, look! Dad's on TV! Hello, I'm Tom Tucker, here with local fortune seeker Peter Griffin, who appears to have found a clue to a hidden treasure. That's right, Tom, and I sincerely hope that the caption beneath me doesn't say ""Local Fatty."" Let's do something about that caption. All right, well, you can check out the clue at our Web site: We were a little late getting a Web site. Quick, Neil! Sign into the neighbors' Wi-Fi so we can get that clue. Nurse, write down that clue, and then go out in the waiting room and maybe start lowering expectations. Treasure?! Yeah, baby? Bring me a grape wine. Peter, what the hell! Now everyone has the clue! Why would you do that? Because I'm tired of people saying I don't know nothin'. Everyone doubted me, so I wanted to rub it in their faces that I was right. All right, where is it? Give me that! Is this all there was? Yeah, is there anything else we should know before we start looking? Whoa, whoa, whoa. This is our thing. We're not sharing this with anyone. Peter, come on, are you serious? If Joe or I found this, we'd want you right alongside us. Well, yeah, we're like peas in a pod. Wait-wait. Don't go in there. He's doing his podcast. Oh, that's cute. Now, that I like. What do you think about this, you old bag? Oh, no. Look, you guys doubted me, mocked me, constantly handled my Eggo despite my clear instructions, and now you want a piece of my treasure? I don't think so. Well, fine! We don't need you anyway! Peter, I don't like this. It seems like this treasure is already turning people against each other. Hang on, you guys. I think I might have figured something out. ""The circle in the square."" That could be the clock in the town square. Wow, that You're right! Brian, that could be it! Well, let's get down there before anyone else does. Son of a bitch! Everyone's already here! Let's see, ""Face the circle in the square."" ""Face the circle."" ""Face."" Okay, the gesturing needs to stop. No one else is doing that. Look! When you face this way, you're looking at the statue of Miles Musket. Crap, you guys, there's already other people here. They must have figured it out, too. You're right. Okay, gather round, kids. Family suicide. Look-- there's a plaque! ""This square shall forever honor ""the memory of my son, Timmy Musket. ""Always a chip off the old Block. ""May he rest in peace. Miles 'Chatterbox' Musket."" Wait-- when I played Jane Musket in the school play the last three weekends-- thanks for coming I couldn't. I had a thing. I had a lot of dog stuff that day. Yeah, weekends I like to spend with my kids. I learned that Timmy Musket is buried in a cemetery on Block Island. I remember it because my big speech was, ""Timmy"" Meg, please. That must be what ""chip off the old Block"" means! That's it! Meg, take the car home! Your mother and I are taking the ferry to Block Island! Chris, we need to find that treasure for ourselves. What do you mean? Even if Dad finds the treasure, he's not gonna share. He'll just blow through it all. Maybe you're right. I mean, last time we came into some money, he just wasted it on all those diamond pinkie rings for everybody. What?! Uh, well, uh, yeah, we should probably go. What the hell? Where are they going? Oh, forget them. They're dead weight. If this treasure's going to be found, it's up to you and me, Brian. What do you mean? Come on! You think the fat man's gonna figure out those clues? He's an idiot. Yeah, I guess you're right. Yes, I mean, he's the guy who put all those little bald men in incubators because he thought they were babies. Look at you. You came early, but you're gonna make it. I'm a senior vice president at an investment firm! Oh, someone's a fussy britches.  Sailing  Takes me away  To where I've always  Heard it could be Want half a Mounds bar? What? Who eats a Mounds bar? I do. My whole life, I don't think I've ever seen a single person eat a Mounds bar. Well, you're about to see one now. So, you walk into a store, you see the hundreds of options for candy, and you choose a Mounds bar? Yep. So what is it you like? The coconut? The chocolate? Yeah. Both those things. How long you been eating 'em? Uh, I've probably been having a Mounds bar two or three times a day for the last 25 years. Geez, no wonder you can't walk! You have total renal shutdown! Your kidneys are drowning in a stew of chocolate and coconut! Give me that! What are you doing? Why are your nipples poking into me? Sorry. That happens when I'm cold. But why are there three of them? There aren't. Two of them are moles. Those numbers still don't add up! Why the hell are we taking a hot air balloon? I don't think we're anywhere near Block Island. Oh, I know. We passed that miles ago. What? Well, then what about the treasure? Two friends sailing in the sky in a wicker basket with a strange man holding a cheese plate? This is the treasure, Bri. You want a Vicodin? Isn't it dangerous to do drugs Yeah. Exactly. What the hell?! Never gonna die! Your friend is, like, the coolest guy I've ever had up here. Oh, damn it, Lois, they're already here! This is all your fault! What?! How is this my fault? Because you just had to stop for ice cream! Then you get in there, and you order like you never heard of food before! Oh, ""Coffee Fudge Swirl with Reese's Peanut Butter Cups."" Oh, I wonder what's in that! You just listed off all the ingredients! Everything you just said is what's in that! Well, I hate to say it, but I guess we're supposed to dig this kid up. Any volunteers? I dig kids. All of you, hold it right there! If anyone's digging into this little kid's grave, it's me! You're too late. We got here first. No, it's my treasure hunt! I found the first clue! You guys are just horning in! You guys, calm down! See, this is what I was talking about. You can't desecrate a child's grave! Don't worry, Lois. We're gonna do it with reverence. Hey, how about a little digging song?  Little Peter Griffin  Diggin' up a casket  Shovelful of dirt and bop ya on the head.  I didn't care for the end of that song. Oh, my God! The treasure's in the casket! Come on, Meg, let's get it! My treasure! Oh, my God! You hit your own son! That's it, Peter. I am not gonna stand here and be a part of this madness. You're on your own, because I quit! Chris, Meg, we're going home. Well, good! You were just slowing me down anyway! You, Asian lady, you're the new Lois. I will have one scoop of mint chocolate chip in a waffle cone. You are a practical, straightforward people. What do you guys think is in here? Sounds like books. Oh, my God! Feels so weird to be looking at a dead kid and not have angry parents nearby. Hey, look! There's something written inside the lid. ""You've crossed the miles, you've pawed through clues. Find where he hits, misses, cheers and boos."" By the way, for those who came on my boat, I have those sandwiches. ""Hits, misses, cheers, and boos."" Could be baseball? And ""pawed through clues."" Could it be Paw tucket? The Pawtucket Red Sox play at McCoy Stadium. Quagmire, let's get to that stadium! Eh! Lois took the bike. Hey, wait a minute. This is a great time for me to do my Suzuki Samurai promo! Are you a Hawaii scumbag? Do you chug energy drinks in Arizona? Suzuki Samurai-- ninja name, garbage car. You sons of bitches, this is my Oh, my God, look at 'em. Lois was right. This treasure hunt has turned them all into animals. There's more where that came from, mister! He was right. There was more! Oh, look who's back-- the grave robber. Hey, Lois. So, what happened? You find your treasure? No. I realized something after you left. It's not the treasure that matters. All that really matters is the money you get in exchange for the treasure. I guess I had to learn that the hard way. Per, you were a real jerk out there! I know. You were right. I took this thing way too far. And I'm really sorry about how I treated you and the kids. But you know me. If I read anything on a place mat, I I just kind of go nuts. Can you forgive me? Chris forgave me. I can't wait for you to fall asleep tonight. Of course I forgive you, Peter. So I guess everyone else came to their senses, too, huh? No, they all ran off to McCoy Stadium. What? Why? What's at McCoy Stadium? Ah, there was a clue at the graveyard. Here, I took a picture with my phone. Oh, it's the next picture. Just swipe it to the next one. She saw me. ""You've crossed the miles, you've pawed through clues. Find where he hits, misses, cheers and boos."" Peter, this can't be leading them to a baseball stadium. Baseball wasn't invented until the 1800s. Wow, you're really smart, Lois. You know, Peter, in the first eight minutes of Meg's play, before I walked out, they said Miles Musket was a horrible drunk and a wife beater. So, when it says, ""hits, misses,"" it might be talking about hitting Mrs. Musket. And he probably misspelled ""missus"" because he was drunk when he wrote it. Or maybe he misspelled it because cursive is hard, and everyone should get off his back. And ""cheers"" and ""boos"" might be referring to a bar where he would ""cheers,"" and drink his ""booze."" ""Hits missus, cheers and booze."" Wait a minute-- it's got to be an old bar, right? The Clam's the oldest bar in town. That must be where the treasure is! All right, let's you put some makeup on and get right down to The Clam! Oh, no, they're closed. Hang on. I got an idea. But you have to believe. What? You have to believe. Say you believe. Okay. I believe. This is worse than the time we were in The Clam right now. Yes! Peter, look! That's Miles Musket! It is? Yes! How have you never seen this painting before? Lois, I'm completely hammered every time I'm in here. We did it! We found the treasure! You know what, Peter? Why don't you open it? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, okay, I'll-I'll open it. Here, hold this. ""Congratulations. ""You have won The Founding Father Restaurant ""Treasure Hunt Challenge. ""Please enjoy one free meal ""at select Founding Father locations. Expires May 16, 2006."" Wait a second. What year is it? It's 2013, Peter. So that's It's before. The coupon's no good. Oh, man! Um, this sucks worse than when I went to that strip club without Lois. Yay! Well, Peter, I hope you're not disappointed we didn't find any treasure. No, it's fine. You know, the important thing is we figured out those clues together. I mean, so what we won't be able to pay to fix them veins in your legs. You're my treasure, Lois, and I want you on my team for everything. Except for sports. Me too, Peter. I love you. I love you, too, Lois. No way that's the shrimp."

Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Peter, come on, get dressed. We're late for church. I don't want to go to church. I always feel like that priest has it in for me. Body of Christ. Body of Christ. Butt of Christ. Aah! Lois, trade me. No. You're not wearing that to church, are you? What? Yeah. Why not? This is what I always wear. She's right, man. It's Sunday. Get noticed. I'll be in the car. I'm getting tired of you wearing the same thing every day. Look, that shirt's got a hole in it. I'd like to point out that Jesus wore the same thing every day. And you didn't hear Alice giving him a hard time about it. Who? Wasn't that her name? Let's just get to church. And afterward, you're going to the mall to go clothes shopping. Well, you're coming with me. Last time I tried shopping without you, it was a disaster. Hey, I'm home. I got groceries. You what? Yeah, I was driving past there, and we were out of some stuff, so I You listen to me, you son of a bitch! I've got one thing in this lifetime! One thing. (groaning) You always say I never do anything around here. Yeah, I like saying that more than I like you doing things. Dad, I got the rest from the car. Where? Chris, run! You were right! She didn't appreciate it! Oh, crap! CHRIS: Ow! That's right. I do groceries. All right, even though we just walked in, and this whole place is one hallway, let's consult the map. Okay. Uh-oh. (gunshot) I'll bet we can find you some new clothes in here. PETER: Hey, Lois, are you sure this place is for men? Yes, Peter, it's for everyone. Really? 'Cause this-this kind of looks like a dress. Peter, it's fine. Come on out. Ha! You gaybo! Hang on, Peter. I'm gonna go look for a couple things for me in here. I'll be right back. Okay, Lois, I'll be right here, standing uncomfortably close to the unnecessary piano player in the middle of the mall.  So, what's it like now that you've made it? Did you ever have a bank account full of pedestrians' disinterested smiles? You're amazing. I'm gonna sit Indian-style on top of your piano. There aren't enough verses in any song I could write that would express how much hatred I have in my heart. You talk like a book. Hey, Lois, how about we try Sears? They got good stuff. Peter, nobody's been in Sears for decades. Oh, come on. When I was a boy, we always used to go clothes shopping at Sears. Trust me. They'll have everything I need. What the hell happened here? Look out! (muffled speaking) He wants to know who you are. We seek clothes for the cold times. (muffled speaking) He says he'll take you to the clothes for herbs and meat. Well, we can probably come up with some herbs and meat, right, Peter? Peter? I'm with them now. No girls allowed. (tires squealing) See, Lois, now, this is more like it. What the hell? Why won't this button? It's the same size I always get. Maybe you put on a few pounds, sweetie. Lois, I weigh the same that I weighed in grade school. Perhaps it's this lump on the side of your neck, sir. Oh, my God, Peter! How long have you had that thing? I-I don't know. We got to go see Dr. Hartman right away. Oh, my God, what if it's something serious? It's all right, it's all right. We'll be in good hands with Dr. Hartman. He handled my reassignment surgery. I think, emotionally, I've always been a lizard, you know? And now, I feel comfortable finally in my leathery, scaly skin. Kids, if you need me, I'll be on the wall making rapid, darting glances. Is this just to get out of my parents' visit? No. (doorbell rings) BABS: Hello! No, you're stupid! Oh, hello, Griffins. What can I help you with today? Dr. Hartman, Peter has a huge lump growing on his neck. Mrs. Griffin, that's called a ""head."" I've been fooled by that one before. Well, will you take a look at it? I think it might be a tumor. Okay, let's have a look. Oh, yes, it appears that there is a Great rack, by the way. Thank you. Well, thank Grandma Griffin, really. It appears you have a subcutaneous vestigial twin growing on your neck. What is that? Well, it's an incomplete twin that never developed into a fully-formed person but still exists as a growth feeding off your body. Now, hold still. I'm just gonna give you a little topical anesthetic, and we'll have a closer look. (high-pitched voice): Hi, everybody! Aah! What the hell is that?! Oh, my God! It's a little me! Well, it looks as if he's more fully formed than we thought. Wow, your wife is gorgeous! Is that a foot? Almost! This is awesome! Finally, I'll have an interesting silhouette for the beginning of my spoken-word jazz. (stand-up bass plays slow jazz) I left my poem at home. MALE ANNOUNCER (over TV): We now return to Quantum Creep.  Al, what year is it? Cool. I'm gonna go show my penis to some kids. Hey, Dad. How'd it go at the hospital? Kids, remember how when you were little, you always wanted a neck uncle? No. Well, now you got one! (screaming) What is that thing?! This is my vestigial twin. I named him Chip. You know, like ""chip off the old neck."" I like to poke him 'cause it makes him happy, and I feel it a little bit in my nads. (both giggle) Well, keep that freakish thing under wraps. I don't want it cramping my style while I'm macking on toddlers. See you around, bitch. You know, Lois, a lot of times you go into someone's house, and it's just a house, but you can tell this is a home by all the love here. Aw! Aw! Aw! Aw! Peter, this seems unnatural, and, quite frankly, dangerous. Hey, you must be the owner of that Prius outside. Thanks for saving the world. He gets it. He gets what we Prius owners are trying to do. Wow, the world is such a cool place. There's so much I want to do and see! Oh, he's such a great energy to have around. Ah, Chip, I am gonna show you all kinds of cool stuff. My Hot Wheels, my lawn darts, even my new musket. (rapid, rhythmic whirring) Peter, what the hell are you doing? Lois, I thought I heard a noise downstairs. Go stall 'em for 20 minutes and pray that it's not too damp in here. (strums chord) Man, how do you know so many songs? Oh, when you're trapped under a layer of fat, a muffled folk song is like manna from Heaven. Give me a C. (strums chord)  Michael, row the boat ashore   Hallelujah BOTH:  Michael, row the boat ashore  Hallelujah Sister, help to trim the sail.  Sister, help to trim the sail   Hallelujah  Sister, help to trim (roaring) Aah! Run! No, Peter, gently stroke his snout counterclockwise. Wow, it's working. There's a universal language for all creatures, and it's called love. Now, how about that River Jordan?  River Jordan is deep and wide   Hallelujah Join us, bear! ALL:  Milk and honey on the other side   Hallelujah. (strums ending chord) Good morning, boys. What's in store for today? Well, I thought we'd start with a vigorous power walk around the neighborhood. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I was thinking we would just watch Dr. Oz and eat cold cuts off our stomach. Those people ain't taking good care of themselves. What?! But there's so much to do and experience! Did you know that the Quahog Museum has an interactive display on the history of the garment district? Oh, look, Chip, Chip, slow down, all right? You know, just because everything's new to you doesn't mean you have to do it all at once. Peter, where's your sense of fun and adventure? You're starting to sound like a stick-in-the-mud. Well, that stuff sounds exhausting. I'm just being honest, like George Washington. George, did you chop down our cherry tree? I cannot tell a lie. Yes. And what is this pamphlet I found under your bed called ""The Boston He Party?"" Not mine. Wow! Is there any better time in the world than 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday? You already have two days of hard work under your belt, and there's so much more work to come. Look, I'm trying to get this stuff done here. Griffin, did you finish those purchasing reports? Oh, that voice! It's like God sneezing! What the hell is this? They found a guy on my neck. Hello there. I've never met a supervisor, slash supermodel before. Do you like crab? There's a knockout crab place right around the corner. What the hell are you doing? I'm using my knowledge of the local food scene to get this woman to go to bed with me. Well, now we know. I can taste what he eats. What are we watching? Oh, it's just a tennis match. So this is tennis! (racket hits ball) Wow! (to tennis balls hitting): Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! MAN (on TV): That was just one point?! Federer and Hastings are known for their long rallies. Federer to serve. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! And this is just the first game of the first round of a three-week tournament? Yay! (sighs) This is more painful than sitting through those parent-teacher-cheetah meetings. So, in short, your kids are all doing great. Keep reading to them every night, and I think we're gonna have a great year. So unless there are any questions, thank you all for coming. Uh, yeah, I noticed the hot lunch menu doesn't feature any gazelle. (others groan loudly) I'll bring that up to the board. Yeah. See, I-I heard that last year, (chuckling): and here we are again.  Listen, Doc, is there any way you can have this thing on my neck removed? Well, Mr. Griffin, your organs and his are intertwined. That would be a highly dangerous procedure. You could die. On the other hand, if you live, I'll let you pick any prize off that shelf. Even the tiny pinball machine? Oh, that-that shouldn't have been up there. Look, Doc, you got to do the procedure, all right? I-I don't care if I die. I mean, maybe in my next life, I'll come back as an air bag or something. (rhythmic ticking) It's okay. It's okay. Peter's got you. Don't you worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Is my wife okay? No, the ski boots that was in the back flew up and chopped her head off. You can turn your blinker off now; it's very annoying.  Nurse, have somebody fix that clock. It's very distracting. All right, let's get this started.  (machine beeping) All right, halfway done. Time for a break.  I hate myself  For loving you  Can't break free  From the things that you do  Oh, God, I'm so nervous. Thank God Stewie's too little to understand. Look at him over there, playing that board game. Ah, three. Okay, one, two Sorry! ANNOUNCER: Sorry! The board game that teaches you to be a dick. Dr. Hartman, is everything all right with my dad? Griffins, I'm afraid we lost him. What?! Oh, my God! Hey, guys. Oh, there he is. It worked! I'm free at last! But what about Chip? Where's Chip? Hey, everybody, look who's walking! OTHERS: Chip! Oh, Chip, I'm so glad you're okay. Yeah, and I'm okay, too. So, uh, you know, Chip, now that you're a free man, this is a chance for you to go out and make a real life for yourself someplace. I'll tell you what, anywhere you want to go, I'll FedEx you. What are you talking about, Peter? Chip is part of our family. He's staying with us. What?! Yay! Yay! Awesome! Hey, hey, Dad? Yeah, I'm done. Can you pick me up? Oh, that's okay; I have a book. Oh, hey, Peter. Lois, where's the couch? Chip redecorated the room to improve the feng shui. He said our old furniture was blocking the flow of energy. I had my life's fart savings in that couch! And where are the drapes? Chip took them to make play clothes for the children. What?! (Chip and others laughing) (laughter continues) Oh, hey, Peter. You're home. Hi, Dad! Hi, Daddy. We dug a lake for this! ALL: Whoa! Come out of that water at once! Gosh, isn't Chip wonderful? No, he's not wonderful, Lois; he's annoying. I don't get why everyone's so in love with that guy. What's so great about him? Well, to be honest, the same thing that used to be so great about you. What? What are you talking about? Just that when you were younger, you were as passionate and full of life as him. (high-pitched): Hey, boys, catch me if you can! Oh, crap! I didn't realize they had bikes! (groans) What are they gonna do when they catch me? Oh, boy, I got a back-of-the-head punch coming, I just know it!  LOIS:  It seems today that all you see  What the hell?  Is violence in movies  And sex on TV  But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely? What the? What the hell is going on here? You're singing our song without me? Oh, sorry, Peter, we couldn't find you. Do you want to sing your part, Peter? Go ahead.  But where are the fashioned   Good fashion I don't want to! (sobbing)  I tell you, Chip is making my life a living hell, you guys. Remind me again, Chip is that African kid you adopted? No, that was Chocolate Chip. We gave him back to Kenya. But I can't take it anymore. I got to get rid of him. Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know yet, but I'll come up with something. After all, I'm the guy who invented ""Choose Your Own Adventure or Have Pie in Bed."" I picked the pie again.  Hey, welcome back to the Mikey Tony Magnanimous Hour, where real people get magnanimous about real things. This week's real thing-- hey, Native Americans, if I saw you on the street begging, I'd throw a buck in your moccasin. Next week's magnanimous thing-- I'm wearing this yellow bracelet. You're welcome. (growling) Peter, what the hell is that thing? It's a dingo. I named him Bingo. If you can't have fun with that, you're crazy. (growling) Hey, Peter. Wh-What's that? Oh, he's gonna turn you into a pile on Joe's lawn. What?! Here, let's play steak catch. Oh, boy, I got it! Hey, back to you, Peter! Ah, cool! Steak catch! I'm gonna use my one steak-in-the-pants time-out. (growling) Aah! No! Not me! Not me! Attack him! Aah! Hey, um, it's 3:00 p.m. Should I give up on breakfast? Aah! Brian! Browser history-- clear it! Peter, that dingo was meant to eat me, wasn't it? Why would you do that? Because my life was fine before you showed up. My family liked me, and-and I didn't feel bad about not ever doing new stuff. Well, I never asked to grow out of your neck. My life was better before I met you, too! You're a terrible brother, husband and father. I'm out of here, and you could go to hell! Wow, what a nice day out! Look! A rainbow! I did it. He's gone. Just as easy as the creation of techno music. Wait a minute, what key are we in? No, no, no, no, no, none of that.  Oh, hey, Peter. Where's Chip? I haven't seen him all day. He likes to yell out ""Good luck!"" after they read each lottery number. He's gone. I threw him out. You what? No! Peter, how could you? Whoa, whoa, what are you all coming down on me for? Meg throws away people who come out of her body all the time, nobody says nothing. Peter, Chip was a part of our family. And he's so little. He can get hurt out there on his own. We got to go find him. We should look for him in the ball pit at McDonald's. You can just leave me there; I'll conduct the search. Meg's right! Come on, kids, let's go find Chip and bring him back! You guys do whatever you want. I got stuff to do, anyway. I got to get ready for my Bar Mitzvah.  Baruch atah Adonai  I want fancy things like my friend Ephraim   I want the newest ten-speed bicycle   That I will ride once, but then I will call my parents   And have them come get me  I want to swim in the pool but only with my shirt on   I want to lose my virginity at 24   But tell everyone I was 16   Ah, crap, I'm out of beer. Great. I have to walk down these stairs the one day I wore heels. (yelling) (screaming) (grunting in pain) Son of a bitch! I think I broke my leg! (grunting) There's no way I'm gonna make it back up those stairs. (phone ringing) Nope. Peter? It's me, Chip. Listen, I I'm sorry for the mean things I said. Help! Peter? Holy smokes! Peter, are you okay? These books was already down here! I'm not a nerd! Oh, my God! We got to get this leg set and get you to the hospital! Oh, cool. That's the place with all the Ghostbusters cars! (grunts) (grunting) (loud grunting) (high-pitched flatulence) (giggles) If you had only done that while you were here, we wouldn't be in this mess. Mr. Griffin, you're a lucky man. If it weren't for Chip here, you might have lost your leg. The bad news is, we did an X-ray, and your body is full of a spooky skeleton man. Gosh, Chip, I don't know how to thank you. No problem, Peter. You would have done the same thing for me. You know, Chip, Lois was right about you. You are special. You've got all the sense of wonder that I somehow lost. I got so used to watching TV and looking for tiny jean fibers in my nuts, I forgot there's a whole world out there to experience. Thank you for showing me that. As far as I'm concerned, you're a permanent part of our family now. Well, that sure is nice of you, Peter, but there's a big old world out there. I want to go out and experience it for myself. ALL: Aw! Why? Well, I'm sorry to see you go, but I understand. Oh, we're gonna miss you, Chip. I'm too tough to cry, but I'm gonna miss you, too. Safe travels, buddy, and keep in touch. I will! Whee! Good-bye, Chip! Bye! Come back soon, okay? PATRICK STEWART: But Chip never did come back. He became the new, young, funny kid on ABC's The Middle. Wow! This is just a whole bunch of loud garbage!"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Hey, thanks for helping me pick out a new computer, you guys. Oh, no problem, Quagmire. God, this place is always so crowded. We gotta find someone who works here. Can I help you, sir? Sorry, all I got is a quarter, pal. Oh, excuse me, sir. My buddy here is looking for a computer. I would like to elect you president. What are you doing? You gonna get a new phone while we're here? Maybe. But I gotta see which one I wanna take in and out of my pocket every 30 seconds for the next six years. What do you think, Peter? Peter? I touched a iPhone headphone. You know what? I think I'm gonna go with this one. Guy said it's the newest version. Just came out this week. Ah, good call, Quagmire. You're gonna be like the first guy in the neighborhood to own a Model T. See ya, suckers! I'll be there an hour after you with throw-up all over my legs! Are you getting excited for Halloween, Stewie? You know, we'll have to start thinking about your costume soon. All right, but let's make sure we don't cover up this, all right? It's what puts candy in the bag. Oh, look, Chris, here's your costume from the year you went as a condom. What the hell are you supposed to be? Oh, Stewie, look! It's your very first teddy bear! Oscar? Wow, I remember that bear. That's the one Grandma and Grandpa brought Stewie when he was still in the hospital. Oh, and here's the card they sent me. ""Three kids on $40,000? Have fun with your crap life."" I guess he got tucked away up here. You want him back, sweetie? What, this old thing? No, no, thank you. I've grown. I've changed. You sure you don't want him? I said no, okay? Don't you have a wedding dress to try halfway on and then cry about? Hello? Oh, hey, Quagmire. What's up? Hey, Peter, I need some help with my computer. I can't find my photos. Did you look under ""Photos""? What is that? It's a folder called ""Photos."" Yeah, I-I don't have that. I just have 40 folders all called ""New Folder."" Okay. You know what? Click on your hard drive. Okay, now-now the arrow on the screen, that's me, right? Yeah, yeah, that's you. Okay, now-now just Whoa-whoa-whoa! There's a calculator on this thing?! Listen, Quagmire, what are you trying to do? I just wanna put pictures of my cat on everyone's Internet computer. Like, how do I do that? Okay, wait. There's an agreement that just popped up. Hang on. L-Let me read the whole thing. Just hit ""Accept."" Well, that seems a little foolhardy, doesn't it, Peter? Look, do we have to do this now? I'm watching something. I know. I'm sorry. I-I'm just nervous that somebody else is gonna get pictures of their cat on the Internet first, and then I'll always be known as the second guy to get pictures of his cat on the Internet. Quagmire, I don't know how to tell you this, but there's already cats on the Internet. Wait, it's-it's giving me that pinwheel thing. It-It's frozen. Oh, my God, oh, my God, it crashed! The whole thing just crashed! Geez, Quagmire, calm down. We'll figure it out. No, Peter, the whole thing's fried! I can't even! Ah! damn it! What the hell?! Hey, you clicked ""Accept."" Hey, what's going on? You doing some reading there? Yes, well, you know I turn to poetry when matters of the heart weigh heavily on me. ""If you're happy and you know it, ""then your face will surely show it. ""If you're happy and you know it, ""clap your hands. Anonymous."" Wait-- matters of the heart? What are you talking about? Well, Lois found my old teddy bear, Oscar, in the attic. And I'm just not sure how to handle it, what with Rupert and all. Who cares? Just play with them both. I can't do that! Oh, it would be so awkward! Um okay. Oscar was my well, he was my first, you know. And that's always exciting. But-but I've been with Rupert for so long now. Uh-huh. Most of our finances are intertwined. We've built a life together. On the other hand, Oscar Oscar's the only one who can really make me laugh. I hate to say it, but I'm mostly with Rupert because of his insurance. Stewie, I think you're overthinking this. No, you're right. You're right, Brian. I'm with Rupert now. I just need to forget Oscar. No matter how intense our relationship was. That's amazing. It's like you took all the colors that exist and said, "", here's a new one."" Hi, can I help you? Well, that depends. Do you know how to fix pieces of junk?! Haven't been stumped yet. Okay, I see what your problem is. I-I-I tried to buy a sweater online, and I-I think I got a virus. No, the porn's not the problem. Your browser history shows that you've been going to kinkylatinas.net. But that site has a bunch of malware. Oh. Personally, I'd recommend College Latinas. I mean, I wanna see Latinas, but I also want them to Speak English. speak English. Yes, exactly. Wow. So you're into that kind of stuff, too? Uh-huh. Would you, uh, would you have dinner with me? Absolutely. Excuse me. I bought this laptop here yesterday, but when I got home I noticed the apple already had a bite taken out of it! So, yeah, I was the first woman to ride her bike cross-country with no seat. Gosh, that's neat, Sonja. And-and where'd you go to college? I think Syracuse, but I don't know. My face was buried in a pillow all four years. Wow, sounds like you took a full class load. Oh, Glenn, I'm so glad you asked me out. Whenever I talk about stuff like this, most people look at me like I'm some kind of disgusting perv. Me, too, but who cares? You should never be afraid to be different. Hoo. Hoo. Whom. Morning. Morning. We kind of had a crazy night. Yeah, we Did we? I don't really remember, but I do feel like I might be down a couple of quarts. Well, even though you seemed like a sure thing, I really wanted to make sure. Oh, my God! You roofied me?! Are you mad? No. I'm in love! Sonja, honey, stay right here. I just have to go to the bathroom. Wait, Glenn. Take this wine glass. We can use it later. My God, I I've never been so happy! I'm telling you guys, Sonja is the perfect woman. She's every bit as kinky and as insatiable as I am. Really? I thought you said she was just some computer geek. She is. Her mouth has enough storage space for a giggity-byte. Oh! Geez, you changed your relationship status already? When you know, you know. All right, but just be careful, ya know? You don't wanna rush an important decision. I'll take the cheeseburger meal. Would you like to make it an extra large meal? Uh N-No. Yes. No. You sure? It's only Yes. No. What the hell? Stewie, what are you doing up here? Brian! It's not what you think! All right, I came up here for a photo shoot and it just got way, way out of hand! You're having tea. How is that out of hand? Is your shirt on backwards? Please! You can't tell Rupert I was up here, all right? He wouldn't understand. He'll kill himself, Brian! He's been through so much already! He can't take much more! Brian, he watched his brother drown! Stewie, relax. You're getting all worked up over nothing. Says the guy who freaks out every time a fire engine goes by. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Peter, Peter, you hear that?! I'm matching the sound! Is what I'm doing helping? Glenn, why did you bring me here? Well, I've always had this fantasy of having sex on the basketball court in front of my high school principal. Only problem is he's now completely senile. Yeah, you like this, Principal Goodrich, huh? Remember you once suspended me for showing my wiener in school? I did? This isn't as much fun as I thought it would be. I'm sorry, Sonja, I don't think I can finish. You never could finish, Quagmire! Donahue, get in there! Okay, Glenn, now that we've covered ourselves in black ink, let's do it until we've created every character in the Chinese alphabet. When all said and done, Quagmire body tell story of sadness. Wow, I can't even imagine what twisted deviant act you've thought of this time. I want you to have sex with your father. What?! Yep, and I'm gonna watch. Hi, Glenn. Are you crazy?! No! No way! Glenn, remember, the thing we love most about each other is that we push each other way beyond our normal boundaries. Did you enjoy your stay at the Marriott? No, I did not. Oh, well, excuse me for not being six months old anymore! Oh, and here come the tears! The show is starting, everyone! Come on down! What's all that noise? What the hell's going on up there? We're in a fight is what's going on! Brian, I need you to settle an argument for us: am I Hitler? Because I don't think that I am, but maybe-maybe I'm off base on this. Stewie, take it easy. No, you know what? You may as well call your family now because I'm not going to Sarasota. I don't care if we can't get a refund, we're through! Here, Brian, you take him. Maybe you can make him happy. What? You heard me. Take him. Do whatever you want with him, I don't care. Rupert and I are over! Are you sure? Yes, we're done. I just hope we can handle it better than blue and yellow did when they split up. You were supposed to have the kids here by 5:00. We have plans. It's 5:15. Stop busting my hump, Alicia. Okay, you know what, let's not let's not do this in front of the kids. God, you're right. What ever happened to us? Hey, baby, you ready for dinner? What's up, Scott? We gonna get some barbecue. Hey, guys. No, indoors, not okay. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't do it. Nighttime, not allowed. What? There's nothing wrong with this. No, no way, give me those. Oh, my God. Quagmire, what the hell happened? Is this another one of those sex-related injuries you keep getting? Yeah, it seems like lately that girlfriend of yours is taking things a little too far. No, she's not; everything's great with us. Are you guys still talking about Sonja? All right, I should probably get going. Sonja and I are supposed to go to a ""Brown Eyes Wide Shut"" party. Geez, I don't know what's going on with him. But I guess love does funny things to people. Look at Forrest Gump. Hi, Forrest. I know you just got back from Vietnam and you love me, but I'm gonna go run a train with this group of Black Panthers I just met. Okay, Jenny. Hi, Forrest. I know you came all this way to New York to visit me, but I'm gonna go do blow and have sex with a bunch of stockbrokers. Okay, Jenny. Hi, Forrest. Now that I have the most contagious and incurable disease known to mankind, I'll finally have pity sex with you. Okay, Jenny. And I'll mow the grass and raise the AIDS baby. Hey, sexy. Sonja, what are you doing here? Well, I got tired of waiting for you to get home, so I thought I'd come to you. Come on, Sonja. How about how about we take a night off, huh? The sex has just been nonstop. I mean, I understand that ""no"" doesn't mean ""no,"" but certainly some word has got to mean ""no."" This is one of your fantasies, right? Public humiliation? Mm, it's sexy, isn't it? Sonja, stop, please! Come on, you love it. Ow! Ow! Ow! You're hurting me, and I really need to clean out my trunk! Oh, I'm gonna clean out your trunk. Giggity. That's my word. That's my word! Okay, Joe, Joe, you're drunk, okay? You're drunk; give me your keys. And-and I'm drunk, so I'll give you my keys. Okay, now we're both good to drive home. You been drinking tonight, sir? Uh, no, Officer, I just had a glass of dinner with my wine. Okay, I'm gonna need you to step out of the car and walk a straight line, please. All right, you be safe, sir. There's a lot of crazies out there tonight. Oh, hey, Mr. and Mrs. Quagmire. Hi, Peter. I'm a little worried about Glenn. I haven't heard from him in days. Have you seen him? I haven't seen anybody. I've been grounded for pinching a girl. Hey, are you guys talking about Quagmire? He never showed this morning, and today's the day we usually go apple picking. Get that one. Get that one! Hey, get that one. Get that one over there. No, not-not that one. I already got it! I can't put it back! Well, it's not going in the pie. Well, if you're so smart, why don't you come up here and pick them yourself? And now there's no pie at all. I've already checked Glenn's house, and there's no sign he's even been there. I'm afraid something terrible has happened. Now let's not jump to any conclusions. I'm sure if we just check his usual hangouts, someone will have seen him. Wait a second. He hangs out at the Clam with some fat loudmouth. You find Loudy McFatass, you find Quagmire. Come on, let's go. But Dad, it's the night of my big show. Oh, Chris, I was never gonna go to that. We should get some food in you, mister. You hardly ate any of that cereal I smashed on your mouth yesterday. Brian? Oh, hey. What the hell are you doing? Oh, I've been kind of using Rupert as a chew toy. Chewing him with your crotch? Hey, dogs like humping stuffed animals. What can I say? Besides, you said I could have Rupert. I thought you liked Oscar better anyway. Well, I just changed my mind. And you know Rupert's a dude, right, you gaylord? Okay, you guys, where should we start looking for Glenn? Well, sometimes Quagmire likes to hang out under all the clutter in my garage. So, why don't we just start sorting stuff and throwing stuff away but obviously checking with me first before you throw stuff away. No problem, Peter. Quagmire, if you're in there, hang tight, buddy. We're coming. Right, and if we can't find him in here, he sometimes likes to hang out in between the blades of grass in my lawn. And also, in the firewood that needs to be split. Might he be under the leaves in your gutter? Great question, and yes, he might. So, while you guys are taking care of that, I'll be around back flicking pinecones at a tree with this hockey stick. Aloha. Welcome to Ryan's Hawaiians. Hey, how you doing? Amazing. Have you seen this man? Glenn Quagmire? Nah, the last time I saw him was three months ago. Sold him 70 red shirts. Yeah, he does look good in that shirt. Uh, everyone looks good in my shirts. How about you, Big Island? Uh, I don't know. Do you want to be an oldies' DJ or a 1980's wrestling manager? Yes, both. This is beautiful. Heart disease looks better when it's wrapped in a tropical, floral pattern. Oh, my God, this is hopeless. We've been searching for hours. Glenn could be dead by now. I know, and if you guys are really hungry, I suppose I could eat. Come on, we can't give up. Someone's got to have seen Quagmire. Or if not him, at least Sonja. Excuse me, did you just say ""Sonja""? Yes! I did! That was my dog's name. Excuse me, did he just say ""Sonja""? Yeah, it was his dog's name. Oh, I thought he might have been talking about this super kinky woman who's always down here, trying to lure men to her sex slave shed. No, I think he was talking about his dog. No, Peter, that's the Sonja we're looking for. Sonja must have taken Glenn there. Where exactly is this sex slave shed? I'm not sure, but I've heard she has a unit at Quahog Storage. Apparently that chick's a complete psycho. We got to get over there! Come on, you guys, let's go! Oh, man, I hope we don't catch them doing something freaky. I'm still weirded out from when I walked in on that masturbating Eskimo. Dinner time, Tikaloo. Oh, my God! Doesn't anybody knock? Hey, Stewie, look, I want to apologize about earlier. What the hell is this? Brian, I think it's time that Rupert made his choice. What are you talking about? Talking about love, Bri. Talking about adult decisions. Rupert's been with me, and now he's been with you. It's time for him to pick. Stewie, this is stupid; I'm not doing this. Brian, either you cooperate or I blow my Adam Levine dog whistle. Hey, my voice isn't that high. It is. It is though. All right, Rupert. Who will it be? And before you answer, think of all the good times we've had. The time we met The Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show, that winter we lived on the sun, and here's my favorite. A blank one we can fill up with a future together. Yes! Oh, my God, Rupert, I'm so sorry for everything! I missed you, too! Whatever. Hey, you done with that weird octopus doll? It's you and me forever, Rupert. I just hope Oscar didn't take it too hard. This is it, number 92. This is Sonja's storage unit. Quagmire, are you in there? Oh, he's eating. We'll come back when you're done eating. Glenn! Hurry, she'll be back soon. I can't believe the guy with the ponytail and the facial tattoo at the front desk would let this happen. Well, what's this? We got company? Hold it right there. Please. Do you think I'm afraid of you? Boy, if you were ever gonna stand, this would be the time, Joe. Everybody, just shut up! You idiots should've minded your own business. This is our business. You kidnapped our friend. You're going to jail. Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you. Oh, I don't think you're gonna shoot me. You don't got the boobs. What? I-I don't know. Now, just hand me the gun, Sonja. Oh, I swear to God, you get one inch closer to me, and I'm gonna shoot you. What the hell? Like I said, you're going to jail. Oh, my God, Joe, that was so close. How'd you know the gun would jam? It didn't jam, Peter. The gun was never loaded. Sort of had a mental breakdown in April. No more bullets for this guy. Oh, Glenn, I was so worried about you. Are you all right? No, no, I'm pretty  far from all right. Well, I guess this is as good a time as any. Happy birthday, Joe. You dick! Thanks for your help, guys. I might not be alive if it weren't for you. Hey, no problem, buddy. Yeah, you'd have done the same for us, Quagmire. You know, I guess what I realized from all this is that when it comes to relationships, I need to be the kinky one. Ah, we're just glad to have you back, Quagmire. Yep, and it's good to put all those troubles behind us. My dad told me he's pregnant."

Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  We now return to Captain Central America. It worked! Gracias. What are my powers? Oh, yeah. It's weird. You're, like, really good at painting my living room. Up, up, and get it done by Saturday. We're having a party. Hey, Brian. Can you come in here a sec? Sure, Peter, what's up? You're a well-read guy, right? Well, I don't know. I guess when I read my Henry David, I tend to be pretty Thoreau. Shut up! Yeah, 'cause, you see, I been reading this novel about three guys, happen to be pigs, uh, that decide to build their own houses. So, now, one of 'em builds his house out of straws. Right? Now, how the hell do you build a house out of straws? And-and three pigs living together? Gay. You know? And so's the wolf. He's chasing pigs and blowing everything in sight. Peter, what are you doing? I'm just getting ready for bed. What's wrong? You're-you're naked. I'm-I'm right here. Who cares? You're my dog. Everybody gets naked in front of their dog.

What about Peter? Why-why doesn't he have to wear this crap? Peter's in his crate. I'm actually relieved. The ferry would be overstimulating. Mama! What are you doing out of your box? Hey, Megan. Oh, hey, guys. Wait, did you just call me Megan? That's your name, isn't it? Actually, ""Meg"" is short for something else. Peter, would you give this to the nurse? Uh-huh.  Robots in disguise. Hey, did you guys hear about that new kid? The emo Muslim? Death to America. No, this other guy, Mike Pulaski. He's a complete psycho. I heard he knifed a kid on the playground, then beat up the knife. I heard he can watch Friday Night Lights without crying. I heard the volleyball team's playing a tournament in San Diego. There's a lot of exciting stuff going on. Man, he looks mean. You're very judgmental lately. I don't like this Brandon. The best way to disarm a bully is to befriend him. Watch and learn. Hey, what's up, my main man? Listen, if you ever need the scoop on the local babe scene, just ask. Yeah, I'll do that. Awesome.  Doo doo doo doo doo, taking a shower   Taking a little break to bite at the water  Ah! Oh, hey, Brian. Don't worry, there's no blade in the razor 'cause I'm learning. Peter, what the hell?! What? What's the matter? What do you mean what's the matter? You're completely naked! I told you I'm not comfortable with that! Brian, I can get nude whenever I want, all right? This is my home, and a man's home is his castle. Halt, wench! State your business. Peter, will you please put down the drawbridge? I got a car full of groceries. Hmm. Anything else? I also went to the video store and got Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties. Hey, you guys want to sleep over this weekend? My moms are going out of town to a scrapbooking-clambake retreat. What are they gonna do there? They'll just be scissoring stuff and eating clams all weekend. Sure, sounds grea Oh fudge. Only I didn't say ""fudge."" I said. Oh, my God! I'm so sorry! What's your name, dude? Meg Griffin! I will destroy you. Chris, you have my back, right? I don't know. Let me check. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna need it for the fight. We now return to the Kentucky Derby, where 90% of the audience roots for the horse with the cutest name. And they're off! It's Battle Axe, followed by Redbeard, followed by Bishop, followed by Smiling Pink Bear! Oh, my God, that's my horse! And on the outside, here comes Tiny Kitten Kisses! No, no, that one! And here comes It's Bedtime! Oh, I do not like him. Meg, what's wrong? Some psycho just transferred to my school, and he's going to kill me! Boy, she must really be PBS-ing, right? What? I mean, it's like, pop a couple of tampons, you know? Stewie, do you even know what a menstrual cycle is? Uh, yeah, Brian. It a good way to get around town, that's what it is. Oh, good, you're alone. Hey, Lois. Why are you wearing a robe? Well, I heard about how Peter's making you see him naked lately, so I thought the only way to get even is for you to see me naked. Wh Really? Yeah. It only seems fair. You know what, that makes sense to me. I mean All right, here we go. You thought you were gonna see my wife's penis, but, no, it's mine! You idiot! Good morning, students. This is Principal Shepherd with the morning announcements. Remember that all wagers on Friday's Meg Griffin slaughter must be on my desk by Thursday. Also, Zack Morris, if you could stop freezing time to talk to the camera, the day would go a lot faster. Oh, my God, you guys, what am I gonna do? That psycho is going to kill me. Meg, you've got to find a way out of this fight. Yeah, Meg. You can do it. You're a smart woman, and women can do anything nowadays. I guess you're right. It's not like it's the 1950s. So I see you graduated number one in your class from Princeton. That's right. And I'm certified as an accountant and also have a law degree. That's all very impressive. We'll keep you in mind. Let's see, Pointy Boobs, Medium-Pointy Boobs, Not-So-Pointy Boobs. That's a shame. Hey, Mom, I need to transfer to a different school. Meg, we've been over this. Just because a Facebook page has over 2,000 likes doesn't mean you have to kill yourself. I-It's not that. Mom, please? There's other schools. Carlisle Academy leads the state in teen pregnancies. So I might meet somebody. Meg, Carlisle Academy's a private school. We can't afford it. Don't you remember how much money your father wasted so he could make grand staircase entrances? Hey, is Peter here? Hang on. Peter! Why, Glenn Quagmire. It's been 10 years if it's been a day. I figured out how to get out of this fight. All I have to do is get expelled. That sex tape I released should be everywhere by now, and then they'll have to kick me out of the school. Come on! Really? Ooh. You know what? Good for her. Hey, guys, you four are pretty much the toughest guys in school, right? What would it take to get you to beat up Mike Pulaski? Mental Mike? Are you kidding? Come on, guys, I'll do anything. I-I'll give you a Swallow Friday. You mean a Follow Friday? Oh I've been doing Twitter all wrong. Okay, okay. I-I'll just pay you. Oh, yeah? Well, you're looking at 1,000 bucks for something like that. $1,000? All right. But it's gonna be hard to get that kind of money. I mean, I'm not Judge Judy. Hi, I'm Judge Judy. I get paid $45 million a year to yell at people who have nothing. Now here's an ad about a fat-people disease you have. We now return to B.E.T. E.T. Don't you need to phone home? Nah, I do it later. Brian Griffin? Uh, yeah, that's me. Here you go. Aah! Oh, God! What's in the box, Brian? I got you good! I don't feel right. I want it back. What's going on? Did that kid from the future come back? Oh, no! Meg, are you okay? You guys, I've tried everything, but it's hopeless! He's going to kill me. I can already picture my funeral. Thanks. Didn't want to pay for the hole. This is such a nightmare! At least I have you guys. I don't know what I would do without you. Yeah, uh, about that. Listen, Meg, we decided that maybe it's best if you don't talk to us anymore. Yeah, we could be targeted by association. I don't want to get beaten up by a guy unless it's in a limo after prom. So you're all gonna ditch me when I need you most? Yeah, Meg, it's natural selection. This is how it works in the wild. Hey. Hey, how you doing? Hey there. Hey. Nice spot, huh? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's great. Especially 'cause of that thing over there. You know what's in there? Corn. Really? Wow. I could go for some corn. You're dark, Rog. I don't care. Good luck, Meg. Now we must retreat into the shadows. What am I gonna do? Sounds like you have a pretty big problem, Meg. Huh? Mr. Quagmire? What are you doing in here? This is my base of operations. Mr. Quagmire, the girls' gym class will be in the showers in 20 minutes. Thank you, Shirley. She's been with me 12 years. It's her birthday today. Didn't get her anything. So, I guess you heard about the fight, huh? Oh, yeah, they're talking about it in all the girls' bathrooms. I'm so dead. No, you're not, because I'm gonna help you defeat Mike Pulaski. You are? That's right. Be at my house first thing tomorrow morning, and we'll get started. Wow, thanks, Mr. Quagmire. Well, I better get home. What a good way to get around town. Okay, Meg, you've got a bully problem, and I'm gonna help you. But Mr. Quagmire, why would you want to help me? Because I was once in your shoes, Meg. I wasn't always the confident guy you see before you. You see, I, too, was terrorized by a bully. It was 1986, and the cola wars were at a frenzy. I was sitting in the RC section of the cafeteria when Tracy Bellings approached. Why aren't you drinking Coke, you dork? Pepsi would also be acceptable! It doesn't have to be a two-cola system! RC is what keeps the big guys on their toes! You know what ""RC"" stands for, don't you? ""Chicks Rule!"" She was dyslexic. Anyway, that was the beginning of a long, abusive relationship. It's one thing if you put your penis inside-out in the safety of your own bedroom, but to have it done in the cafeteria To this day, I can't have sex with a woman against her will without thinking about rape. And that's why I'm gonna help you, Meg. I never faced my bully. I don't want you to make the same mistake. But how? Over the years, I've tested the limits of the human body. How much it can stuff in, swallow or choke on. How a scrotum can be stretched into a makeshift sail if stranded at sea. All this knowledge is gonna help you win your fight. Oh, thanks, Mr. Quagmire. I'll take any help I can get. I haven't been this scared since my dad stopped showering for six months. Great meatloaf, Mom. Thanks, honey. Hungry! Hungry! Pour food on my pile! Okay, Peter, here you go. Mmm. I will assimilate this new smell into the larger Borg of my smells. Oh, by the way, Rupert, good news. I pooped out your bow tie. Gaah! Geez, what the hell, Brian?! I can't take it anymore! Message for Brian Griffin! I lost my ass gambling. Have you seen it? Leave me alone, you jerk! Stewie, you got to help me. Peter just won't let up with the nudity. Well, you know how the fat man operates. He won't stop unless he's stopped. The only way you're going to end this is if you find a way to even the score. You've got to be nude. Stewie, I am nude. I'm just covered with fur. Well, shave it off. Give him a taste of his own medicine. Maybe you're right. I mean, I got to do something. This is just one of those things he won't let up with. Like when he was guest hosting Inside the Actor's Studio. Jeff Daniels, what is your favorite Care Bear? I, uh, uh I don't know any of the Care Bears. Right, but if you had to pick one, who would be your favorite? Well, like I said, I'm not really familiar.. You can just say the color. I know all the Care Bears. I I don't know. The blue one. There's, like, Are you here to dick around, or you want to do Inside the Actor's Studio? All right, Meg, the best way for you to focus your rage is if I wear the mask of the person who's bullied you every day of your life. Now, when I give the word, I want you to come at me with everything you got. Oh, hey, Meg. Hey, Peter. You know, Peter, I'm glad I ran into you. We really need to talk about Quagmire. You got time for a beer? I don't know. He's just so needy. And I feel like he's jealous of our friendship. You all right, Peter? You seem a little quiet today. I'm fine! Oh, okay, good. Hey, Peter. Hey, Joe. I'm glad you guys are here. I've got terrible, gross medical news for Quagmire. Maybe you can help me break it to him. Mr. Quagmire, how am I supposed to beat a guy like Mike Pulaski? He's massive! He may be stronger than you, but you're grosser. And you're gonna use that. Your weird body can be a dangerous weapon if used properly. Okay. Now, did you ever play old-school Nintendo? No. Well, then what we're about to do may seem strange, but just go with it. Now, Meg, in order to get you into fighting shape, I want you to drink this glass of raw eggs. I don't see any yolks. Just drink it. Hello? Cynthia! Oh, my God! So good to hear from you! Sure, I can talk. I'm just sitting out here in the open. My car? It's a Prius. I wouldn't say I'm specifically a hero for driving one. The heroes are the ones who come back from Iraq and drive a Prius. Gotcha! Wha what the hell?! Hey! You looking for me? Oh, God, what the hell is that?! What's wrong? You look uncomfortable. Here, let me give you a hug. Aah! Get away from me, you gremlin! Aah! No! Why don't you rub my belly, pal?! Your skin is so loose and wrinkly! It's like I'm just pushing around a plastic bag full of chicken bones! Ugh! Why do you have so many nipples? You gonna put your clothes on?! Yes! Yes! I swear! You gonna keep 'em on?! Yes, I promise! I'll never bother you again with my body! Please, just make this stop! Good. Dad, can you give me a ride to the ? What is that thing?! Aah! Make it go away! What's going on in here? (Peter whimpers, Chris cries Oh, my God, is that a  rat?! Peter, hold it down, I'm getting the gun! Hey, who you taking to Meg's funeral? I'm taking Jill. Ooh! Wise guy, we're going as friends. All right, Meg, remember what I taught you. Relax my throat and make eye contact? No, no, the fighting stuff. Um, listen, before we start, could you not hit me here because these are pretty sensitive? He punched her pretty! Oh, he punched her ugly again. Ah! Aw! Ah! Aw! Ah! Just stop there! Aw! Punch Rocky Dennis! It's okay, guys. I'm at peace with what I'm all about. Meg, remember what I taught you. Use the gross. You ready for more? Are you?! Ugh! Your kiss is definitely not on my list! He's older. You missed! Oh, what's the matter, Mike? Can't punch a girl in the face? You'd be surprised what my face can do to you! Ugh! What's your problem, dude?! You've got major issues! Oh, my God, she's crazy! Did you hear the volleyball team lost in San Diego? All right, you little bitch, it's time to end this thing! Yeah, it is! Oh, my gosh! Meg won! Huh, not bad for a loser. Thanks for your help, Mr. Quagmire. I guess I get to die another day. Meg, I got a feeling you're gonna be around for a real long time. Come on, let's get out of here. But I wasn't around for a long time. A year later, my body reacted to a frozen hot dog, and I died of septic shock. I became the public face of internal hot dog defrosting. Cold. Well, it worked. Thanks for your help, Stewie. If I knew you were actually gonna do it, I wouldn't have suggested it. You look like my foot that time Lois made my bath too hot. Come on! It's not that bad. My fur will grow back in about three months. Well, I can't look at this for three months, so I've come up with a solution. Put these on. Stewie, I Hold still. There you go. You look good. You look really good. Hi, Stewie, and Stewie?! This is next week's story. Get there."
Family Guy s12e05 Episode Script            ,"


                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Good afternoon, Quahog. Our top story: price wars are heating up between all of the major airlines and even a couple of the little crashy ones. We now go live to Tricia Takanawa with more on the story. Tom, I'm standing here at Boston's Logan Airport, where some of the same security people who let the terrorists on the plane are still gainfully employed. With such low fares, even those who never fly are lining up to buy tickets. Early reports suggest that this could be the most profitable day for airlines in the last two decades. I'm Tricia Takanawa. Back to you, Tom. Hi, Mom. (in Joe's voice): Hi, Joe. Wow, Peter, did you hear that? Low airfares. Why don't we take a trip? We never go anywhere anymore. We're gettin' stagnant. What are you talking about? We go places. We took that helicopter tour of Tucson. Wow. I've never seen so many boats not near bodies of water. That park is all concrete. Look, there's a dog tied to a other dog. I think that guy with long hair is a lawyer. Look at all those students running for their lives. Oh, there's the concrete park again. Peter, I'm talking about real travel. We can finally afford to go somewhere good. Joe and Bonnie went to Europe and had the time of their lives. Hey, I know a place you can go, Lois: Hell. There, I said it. Now shut your mouth. Lois, I hate travelling. Besides, my passport picture is awful. Ugh, you look like a human cigarette. But it's not just about you, Peter. Think about the family. It would be an amazing experience for the kids. It would give them some culture. Lois, the kids can get all the culture they need right here in Quahog. Really? More culture than Europe? That's right, and I'm gonna prove it to you. I got more culture in my pinkie toe than all of Europe put together. (singing opera) (wild applause) Oh, my God! I got ringworm, too, but it's not classy like this. Okay, kids, now this is the Quahog Museum of Science. A magical place of cultural exploration.  That sucked. Now, one thing that makes us more cultured than our European counterparts is high school football. Then why are we standing here in the parking lot? Because sometimes your team loses, and you have to beat up the ref. What part of Eatonville you from, huh? What part of Eatonville you from? Ow! West Eatonville. Oh, really? West Eatonville? Do you know Bob Hanley? I'm Bob Hanley. No kidding! Bob, it's me, Peter Griffin. Oh, my God, how the hell are you? I'm doing great. I'm doing great. Well, hey, oh, listen. I was really sorry to hear about your dad. Oh, that means a lot. Yeah, I'm sorry I couldn't make it to the wake. I was out of town. It's okay. Thanks for the flowers. Oh, it's the least I could do. Hey, Chris, get over here. You got to meet my buddy Bob Hanley. Hi, Mr. Hanley. I'm Chris. I heard a lot about you, sir. We now return to Downton Syndrome. Well, if I must accept your proposal in order to break the entail and save my family's estate, then yes, I will marry you. Yay! Everyone, I've got a surprise. Whoa! I did not see that coming. No, Chris, I haven't said it yet. Today was the last day of the low airfares, and I couldn't let the opportunity pass, so I got us tickets to Italy! That's amazing, Mom! Lois, is Peter okay with this? Well, Brian, I haven't quite told him yet. But what if he says no? He can't say no. I already bought the tickets. Tickets for what? Uh, uh tickets for the, um, the grand opening of the biggest water park in all of Rhode Island. Hmm, well, pardon my skepticism, Lois, but I didn't read about this in the latest issue of Water Park Enthusiast Weekly. Well, they-they had to, um, keep it secret. For fear that, um th-that this new park would put all other water parks out of business. Typical Big Water. Always keeping the public in the dark. So this one's bigger than Raging Waters? Yeah, Dad. It's way bigger. How does the boy know? Uh, because I-I told him. I-I know someone who-who helped, uh, build it. Wow, so we really got an inside track on this thing. But it can't be bigger than Six Flags Atlantis. Oh, it is, Peter, it is. Because it's Seven Flags Atlantis. (gasps) That's a whole flag more of water! Get in the car! Okay, everyone, put the sunblock on now, so when we get off the plane, we go right to the park. Wait, why are we on a plane? Uh, you-you want to beat the lines, don't you, Peter? All-all right, Brian, enough. I-I can't do this anymore. Peter, we're not going to a water park. We're going to Italy. What?! But what about Seven Flags Atlantis? Peter, don't be silly. Th-There's no such place. (over P.A.): This is your captain speaking. If you look out the left side of the airplane, you'll see the very popular Seven Flags Atlantis. Aw! (children laughing) I'm gonna go ahead and turn off the seatbelt sign, so you idiots can all stretch and let the fart festival begin. Why are you such a dick, Jim? I'm just mad about pilot stuff. I can't believe you tricked me into going to Italy. Peter, our family could use a trip like this. Plus, it might be good for you and me, too. It's the most romantic country in the whole world. And God knows we could use a little romance in our marriage. What are you talking about? Just the other night we did that role-playing. Did you like that game of mysterious intruder, Lois? I told you-- I don't know who you are. And my name isn't Lois. Mine is. Let's do it again. Is it true there's no drinking age here? And they serve wine at every meal? Oh, Meg, nobody likes a drunky-chunky. In college, a lot of guys are gonna make you a dare. Hey, you know what, guys? We're six hours ahead here. I'm gonna call Joe and tell him the future. (buttons beeping) Hey, Joe, guess what's about to happen? Who is this? It's Peter. That's impossible. Peter died six hours ago. (gasps) We can't go back. Look, kids, this is the Forum, where the ancient Romans used to have their famous political debates. And this is the Penthouse Forum, where dirtbags write letters about boning in the back of grocery stores. Well, who wants to see where the ancients established the foundation of our American democracy? And who wants to hear a story about a girl who moved to New York without any underpants? I don't know why we even go places. We always just end up reading pornography. We now return to Italian Star Trek. I know I supposed to be-a so logical, but I get-a so steaming a-mad! Peter, the kids are going to the Italian circus, so I thought it might be romantic if we watched the sunset from St. Peter's Basilica. You go ahead, I'm gonna stay here and get frustrated with this nonresponsive hotel TV remote. Come on! Guide! I'm pressing ""Guide""! Stupid remote's not doing anything! Stop what you're doing! Peter, you can't just sit in front of the TV the entire vacation. You know, I'm really getting tired of you being such a complete stick-in-the-mud. Is that some kind of gay slur? I can't believe it's too much for you to watch a sunset with your wife in one of the most romantic cities in the world! But, you know what? It's probably for the best. Because you'd just complain about it! Well, what do you expect, Lois? I didn't want to come here he first place. I'd rather be back home. You know, I could be riding seesaw with Joe. Yay! Well, I guess we're stuck. Hang on. Let me empty this bag. Yay, gross. Fine, you just sit here on the couch. I'll go enjoy Italy without you! God, what the hell's her problem? You know, sometimes I think you forget how lucky you are to have Lois. Otherwise, you wouldn't be acting like such a jerk. Oh, I'm getting it from you now? Don't worry about Lois. She's an American woman in Italy. She'll go out, kill her roommate during a sex game, and then she'll be fine. She might come back even hotter. Well, you might want to look out there. What the hell's she doing with that Italian guy? (door opens, closes) CHRIS: Hey, guys? Do I got to tip the gondolier in here? I, uh, got a little blockage.  I break-a the poops up  In-a little chunks I wish I had someone special to share this with. Let me give you a tour on-a the Vespa. I show you all-a the things I do all day that make-a me smell like this. Hey, Lois, what the hell's going on here? Something you know nothing about. Oh, man, she really is upset. MAN: Having lady problems, are you, pal? Dean Martin?! What are you doing here? I thought you were dead. Well, paisan, as long as love is alive in Italy, so am I. Now, look, buddy, there's a million ways to lose a gal, but there's only one sure way to get her back. Turn on the old Italian charm. But I'm not Italian. Well, you're in Italy, ain't you? I think so, I-I haven't been paying attention. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna ride this rigatoni into the sky.  Volare   Oh, oh, oh, oh  Cantare   Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho  Let's fly way up to the clouds  (low whimpering) Dean, wait! BRIAN: Hey! Get away from him! Peter, you okay? Brian? What happened? I was watching you from the window. When Lois pulled away on that motorcycle, you laid down on the ground and went to sleep. Well, I'm awake now, Brian. And I know what I've got to do. Well, before you do anything, for God's sake, put some clothes on. Brian, calm down. In some countries, this is a compliment. Mmm. Mmmm! Oh, my goodness! Mmm-mm! Oh, please, come on. Is just something I threw together. What the hell? Mi amore! I am here to put you on a pedestal with Italian romance. Look, Peter, showing up here in that stupid costume isn't going to win me over. That's because you lack the passion of true Italian. Mi amore! Peter, stop it. Speak with your heart, not your mouth. Ugh, damn it, Peter! You mean ""Pietro."" Well, by the laws of Italy, I must now kiss myself passionately. Peter, are you all right? Are you kidding? I'm great!  Bouncing around Italia  'Cause I'm a little ball  I can fit wherever, 'cause I am really small  And now, the next scene. (crowd cheering) Peter, put me down! Lois, to prove my love, I have convinced to hold up a romantic message just for you. Peter! Oh, they missed a letter. Okay, I'll admit it-- this is pretty romantic. Listen, Lois. I'm sorry for being such a jerk, all right? I love you. I want to have your baby. Peter, not on a boat. Peter Oh, Peter Come on, Lois, I got a ninety-percenter going. It could go either way. Let's start making choices. Oh, Peter I love you. I love you, too. Wow, Peter, last night was the best sex I've ever had. Me, too. We haven't done it like that since we were engaged but allowed to sleep with other people. The point is, Italy is the best thing that ever happened to us. I know, it's been wonderful. I wish we never had to leave. Well, then, let's not. Let's live here. What? Peter, but but we've built a life back in Quahog. Yeah, but you were right, Lois, we were stagnating back home. Let's start a new life, right here in Italy. Peter, those were our passports! We don't need them anymore. Kids, I got an announcement. He's wearing a rubber. We're staying in Italy. We're Italian now. What?! Are you kidding?! Well, if we're going to be Italian, I guess we should start murdering our brothers. What are you? (gagging) You break-a my heart, Chris. You break-a my heart. (""Funiculi Funicula"" plays) (bicycle bell dings) Hey, Peter, what's-a you rush? I got-a the most beautiful woman in the world at home, and I no wanna keep her waiting. Hey, Vincenzo, play me a tune, huh? (playing ""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") Oh, Vincenzo! Insalata Caprese! (""Funiculi Funicula"" resumes) Ah, Italy. It 9:00 a.m. and I've already kissed eight guys twice. Why-a you looking at other babies, huh? Why you make-a me do that, Ruperto? I no wanna do that! Peter, I know you love it here, but riding your bike around town isn't paying the bills, and the kids aren't learning anything at that Italian school. Look at these big ones, huh? Rut-ta-ta ta-ta, rut-ta-ta ta-ta, rut-ta-ta ta-ta! Is this calculus? I don't know. Rut-ta-ta ta-ta! I think maybe it's time to go back to our real home in Quahog. But I thought you loved Italy. And Italian Peter. And Southern Italian Peter. Olive oil! I do, but I love American Peter even more. Lois is right. We're barely surviving here. I mean, you have to give most of what you earn to the mafia that terrorizes this village. (tires screeching) Peter, I think it's time we all go back home. (sighs): Of course we have to leave as soon as I get an Italian boyfriend. You know, I still don't understand what he does for a living. He gathers coins from the air by jumping on mushrooms. What's so hard to understand?! (""Super Mario Bros."" music plays) Hey, Meg, let's go-a two-player! I got-a Luigi here, huh? Hey, Meg-a! Mario said-a you were into-a weird-a stuff. So, you see, Mr. Consulate, all we want to do is get back to our home in America. So, can we have our new passports now? Mr. Griffin, it's not as simple as that. Your family must take a citizenship test and go through the immigration process like any other foreigner. Foreigner? We're not foreigners. Sorry, Mrs. Griffin. Not only did you destroy your passports, you renounced our citizenship. When did we do that? Oh, I did that on the Italian social networking site, ""Shut-up-a-you-facebook."" All right, Meg, part of being an American citizen is having an opinion on certain hot-button political issues. Now, what is your abortion stance? It's pretty much this. Now, if you will, please sing the national anthem of the United States.  O say can you see  By the dawn's early light  What so proudly we hailed  At the twilight's last gleaming   And I  Eee-I (inhales deeply)  Will always love you-ooh  Oh-I-ee-I Okay, I've reviewed your application. Now, where you listed employment, some of you wrote ""Family Guy,"" and others wrote ""The Family Guy."" Which one is it? (sighs): It's ""Family Guy."" All right, now that you've completed your initial application, it will need to be filed by an immigration lawyer at a cost of approximately $5,000 per person. And assuming that all goes through, you should have your citizenship back in 16 months. Sixteen months? If I didn't know any better, I'd think you were making it hard to become a citizen on purpose. Like you don't want any immigrants coming to the U.S. I wish that were true, Mrs. Griffin, and it probably might be. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go sit on my fat wife. WOMAN: I'm ready for you, String Bean! What a weird guy. Oh, this is terrible. Peter, what are we going to do? I'll tell you what we're going to do. We're going to sneak in. Well, we better get there soon. I want to be there for opening night of Karate Kid 5. Mr. Miyagi, this is kind of embarrassing, but I'm having a problem with erectile dysfunction. Aye, Daniel-san. Miyagi fix. (horn honks) (crane whirring) (clearing throat) Well, I'm so glad to finally be back home in Quahog. Although, I will miss Italy. You made the trip very special for me, Peter. Well, thanks for showing me and the kids what the rest of the world is like, Lois. I think we all learned a lot. And we met a lot of great people. Hey, what about that couple we met in Amalfi? Did you get their number? I did. You ready? Yup. Okay, it's Well, I can't wait to see the rest of the world with you guys. (pounding at door) Mario! You came for me! Come with me, Meg, my princess. We gonna take this relationship to the next level. (game music playing) MEG: Luigi's here again? I thought that was a one-time thing. MARIO: He like-a my sloppy seconds. LUIGI: We-a plumber brothers. We-a not-a high class people."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a family guy  Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us  Laugh and cry  He's a Fam ily Guy!  Hurry, Brian, they're gaining on us! Damn it, we're surrounded! Crap, they got away. Better call the boss. Damn, I'm not getting a smoke signal here. Damn it, Stewie, what the hell did you do?! I know, I know, I messed up. ""I messed up."" You went back to 17th-century Jamestown and you gave guns to the Indians. And now they're running everything! I said I messed up, all right?! I guess I just have this pathological need to be liked. Well, it's not a good trait. Aw, come on. Don't say that. Let me buy you lunch. Thanks to you, the Indians killed all the white people and took over America. I mean, you're the one who's always saying, ""Never alter the past."" Oh, come on, Brian, let's be honest. I frequently alter the past. All right, so, I guess we'll split the bill 13 ways? Hey, Judas, he ordered, like, five margaritas. All you had was a salad. You know, it actually looks like the Native Americans have done all right for themselves. They do seem to have a lot of shops. And it looks like they have medical care as well. Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I've done this several times today, and your husband just isn't responding. Well, have you tried this? Ma'am, this is a place of medicine. And their popular music is interesting. And here it is, the number one song for the 10,000th week in a row, ""Huya-Huya-Huya""!  Huya-Huya-Huya-Huya  Huya-Huya-Huya-Huya Well, no matter.. We better restore things to the way they were. Let's go back to Jamestown and undo Oh, dear. What? What is it? The return pad. Looks like it took some bullets during our escape. Doesn't seem to be working. Hmm. What? Wha-What is that? What is that, ""Hmm""? Wha-What are you looking for? What are you looking for specifically? Yeah, that's right. But I'm afraid our only hope is that perhaps the alternate Stewie in this universe has created his own time machine that we can use. Well, let's hope so, because otherwise they're gonna kill us. Yeah, or stick us on some kind of white people reservation. Don't give them any money. They're just gonna spend it all on deviled eggs. Well, there's my brave warrior. How was work today? Oh, it was so annoying. Everyone was coming around with their daughters, selling Girl Scout corn. Made me feel so guilty, I had to buy, like, 20 ears. Hey, shot in the dark, but, uh, is anyone else in the mood to run really fast in one direction? Look, there it is! And it looks like he has a return pad, too. All right, come on. Let's get back to Jamestown and set things right. Look, there you are giving them the guns! What the hell are you doing there? You told me you were checking on the horses. Well, she's a sizeable woman. That's what I meant. All right, come on. We've got to get those guns back. Hey, hi, how are you today? Good to see you. Listen, uh, we've just been informed that these guns are defective. Uh, we're from the gun company. Um, anyway, you know how we like to take things back from you people? Well, we're gonna go ahead and take these back. That's right. We're from GunCo.. Shut up, you're blowing it. Where you taking guns? Brian, grab the return pad! Get 'um paleface! They're gone. We can talk normal now. Well, everything looks like it should. Only one way to be certain. Okay, let's do a quick search here. ""Native American role models."" ""Zero results found."" Looks like we did it, Brian. Ah, thank God! Hey, what are you gonna do with all those guns? I don't know, sell 'em to some messed up kid? What the hell is that? Stewie? Oh, my God! What are you doing?! This time machine has almost killed us a hundred times, Brian. And yesterday was just too close a call. So I've decided to get rid of it before something irreparable happens. But, Stewie, your-your time machine, it's, like, your crowning achievement. I-I can't believe you'd just destroy it. Trust me, Brian, it's for the best. And, hey, at least I've had some fun with it. Do you know what I did last week? I time-traveled ahead to Christmas so I wouldn't have to wait all year for the new toys to come out. Wow, good timing, little fella. This just came out today. Yeah, I kind of knew that already. Would you like to donate an extra dollar to the Quahog Food Bank? Oh, sure. And would you like to come home and clean my toilet, while we're both doing stuff for each other? Well, I guess that's it. This is, like, the end of an era. Oh, sack up, you twink. It's just a machine. God, look at all the perfectly good stuff that people just throw out for no reason. I don't know. It's mostly twin mattresses. If you have a twin mattress, aren't you pretty much a failure as a human being? No, I mean it. Like, here, look at this street hockey net. It's in great shape. You know, we should take this home and set it up. Get some fresh air, get some exercise. Well, I suppose I could use a new hobby now that the time machine is gone. You sure you're not gonna miss that thing? Nah, I was getting bored of it anyway. You know, not every historical event is all it's cracked up to be. Women, we've spent decades fighting for our right to vote. So, when you go to those booths and cast your ballot, remember, Warren G. Harding is way the cutest!  Oh, girls just want to have fun  Okay, Brian, I'm just putting this out there, but I'm a baby, and only dicks don't let babies win. God, look at this day, huh? You know, usually, I'd be sitting inside writing, you'd be working on one of your machines. But here we are enjoying it. Yes, it is a nice change of pace. Oh, wait, I got to go grab my knee pads. I was using them for for-for this other thing. Anyway, I'll be right back. Brian, look out! Ah, Brian! Oh, my God! Brian! Brian, can you hear me?! Holy crap! What the hell happened?! That guy sucked. Mom, is Brian gonna be okay? I don't know, Meg. But this is the best veterinarian in Quahog. Brian's getting the finest care there is. He had to share the ambulance with a chicken. Um, aren't you supposed to be running around? Don't talk to me. You have a bad reputation in the chicken community. Doctor, how is Brian? Is he gonna be okay? I'm so sorry, Mrs. Griffin, but Brian's injuries are just too severe for us to save him. I don't know how much longer he has, but I suggest that you all go in and say your good-byes. Oh, my God! Brian, no! I can't believe it. Y-You're really Damn it, Brian, you can't die! We were gonna do so many things together. We were gonna become windsurfers. I was gonna be a little better than you, but we were both gonna be good! You guys, I think, I think Brian's trying to say something! You you've given me a wonderful life. I love you all. I'm sorry, he's gone. Oh, my God, he's Yes, Chris, I'm afraid I'm afraid that our Brian is dead! Guys, I'm gonna need a few minutes alone upstairs. I got to do, like, a-a sad yank. Stupid street hockey. I wish we never went to that dump. Oh, this is all my fault. I'm the one who had to throw away the damn time machine. Wait a minute. That's it! I've just got to rebuild the time machine, and then I can go back and save Brian! Oh, happy birthday, Neil! Stewie! How are you? Oh, not well, Yusuf. I need your help. I have to track down a titanium capacitor for a high-wattage mainframe I'm going to construct. Titanium capacitors? Sorry, there's no way to get those anymore. What do you mean? You've gotten them for me before. I know, but the one guy who made those drew a doodle of Mohammed, so he's not around anymore. He wasn't even doing it on purpose, just absentmindedly while talking on the phone. But it was Mohammed, so you know. Oh, that's awful. Okay, Yusuf, thanks, anyway. Oh, dear, Rupert, without those capacitors, it'll be completely impossible to build a functioning time machine. I guess that means Brian is really gone for good. Thank you so much for coming, guys. Brian would be very thankful that you're here. No problem, Lois. You know, I usually don't come to funerals. Since I'm a cop, I always wind up getting hit by a black woman with a purse. You find the man who did this. Uh, ma'am, what's your relationship to Brian? You bring him to justice! You make sure this angel child didn't die for nothing! Are you sure you're at the right funeral? Ma'am, Brian's a dog. You show the world why you became a cop! Okay. Thank you, everyone, for coming today. None of you people came to my funeral! I know Peter wanted to say a few words. Oh, boy, this is, um this is probably the worst pain I've ever had to go through, and I've sprained my ankle twice. Um the truth is, Brian wasn't just my dog. He was my best friend in the whole world. He was smart, he was loyal, and I guess what I'm trying to say is he was like a brother to me. And I-I'm gonna spend the rest of my life missing him. We're all gonna miss him, Peter. We're all gonna miss him very much. Damn it, Ortiz. Stop swinging at junk. My God, I almost served Brian again. I can't believe he's been gone a whole month. Can we at least get rid of the doggie door so Chris doesn't keep getting stuck in it? Every day I get a little further in. You know, I hate to say it, but I-I'm starting to think the only way to stop missing Brian is to get a new dog. Or do we all get Ghostbuster jumpsuits with our names on them?  Who you gonna call?  The Griffins. I'm serious, Peter. I know it might take time to find the right dog, but I really feel like it might be the best way for us to move on. Yeah, Dad. That would be nice. All right, well, I guess it couldn't hurt to look. Really? Another dog? Look, I miss Brian more than any of you, but at least now no one's forcing us to watch those awful PBS documentaries. And now PBS presents Albino Children Are Normal. So, with the exception of not being able to go out in the sun, you're completely normal? Yes. The moon is my sun. I like to kill beetles. Beetles are teachers. I sleep with a fork. All right, guys, time to find a new family dog. Hey, Chris, you're kind of a creep. You should get a ferret. You're right, I am. And I will! I don't know how to choose between all these dogs. Hey, you, green pants. I hear you're looking for a dog or something. Oh, finally, someone who sounds like they went to college. Hi, I'm Peter. Vinny. Oh, Vinny, like the Pooh. Hey, that's kind of cool. So, what's your story? Well, you know, I'm just a regular guy. You throw a stick, maybe I bring it back. Maybe I bring back an iPhone that fell off a truck. So, what do you say? You want me as your dog? Yeah, I think I do! Hey, just out of curiosity, what breed are you? Actually, I'm a pussy hound. Really? All right! That just means I'm one-sixteenth cat. Oh, I wish you hadn't told me that. Well, Vinny, welcome to our home. All right, this is good. This is good. Hey, you guys got a good banging-broads couch, you know that? Vinny, you must be starving. What can I make you for dinner? Are you kidding? You're a hardworking lady. So, tonight, I'm gonna make you dinner. Wow. Well, thank you, Vinny. Whoa, whoa, hang on, Lois. You promised me we were all eating my Play-Doh pasta tonight. Oh, Stewie, did you make something? Mmm, oh, it's so yummy. Num, num, num, num, num. You better mean those ""nums."" Hey, you, what's your name? Chris. How about I call you Hat Boy? Hell yeah! Lower your voice, Chris. It's Hat Boy, bitch! Wow, look at you, Vinny. It's like you're already part of the family. I don't know, fat man, I think you're jumping the gun. I mean, crucifixion seemed great at first, too. Why are you doing that? 'Cause I'm mad at this guy. I'm mad at this jar of pickles I can't open. Nail it up. Hey, guys, I want you to meet our new dog, Vinny. Vinny, this is Joe and Quagmire. Hey, Vinny. How you doing? Real good. Hey, so I hear you're a cop. That's right. Hey, that's great. Maybe sometime you could take me on a ride-along with you, show me the neighborhood. Yeah, I don't take people out on ride-alongs anymore. I had a bad experience with Grimace. I got to be honest, I can't get a bead on you, man. Oh, boy, Vinny, hanging out with you has been the best. You want another beer? No. I'd love one! What? What? The first thing you said was Oh, my God! You're on you're, like, on another level, Vinny! Congratulations. You've won over a complete imbecile. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you just speak ill of the man who busts his tail providing for you? He spent my college fund on puppet clothes. Hey, don't get fresh with me, Estudio. That's not my name. That's not even an Italian version of my name. Oh, whatever. Hey, Vinny, you want to see a puppet show? They all got leather jackets! God, what a jerk. If this guy thinks he's sticking around, he's sorely mistaken. I'm going to ruin him. Just like I ruined that magician's act. People, people, people. This man drives a Saturn. All right, Rupert, I've been left with no choice. I'm going to tell Vinny so much bad news about Italian-Americans that he goes into cardiac arrest. Vinny, there you are. I have some terrible news. Sal Annuncio's kid was killed by a falling piano! Oh! How could this happen?! That kid was an honors student! He'd just applied to SUNY Albany. He just got in to SUNY Albany. Oh! This is too much, Stewie. I can't take it. Oh, my God, it's working. Hey, Vinny, Bobby Lammaduro's kid just got out of the hospital. He beat the cancer! Oh, thank heavens. Big man in the sky knows what he's doing. Chris, what are you doing? Call me a creep, you piece of crap! Hey, Doonesbury, how about a joke that ain't for fancy millionaires? Stewie, what's with the waterworks? Oh, um, um I-I just I realized I paid too much for my muffler. Come on, kid, quit crying. You're gonna get your pants wrinkled. What's the matter? Fine. Do you want to know what's the matter? You're the matter. Everyone in this family is so damn thrilled with you, they've forgotten all about Brian. Well, I'm not thrilled. I'll never forget Brian. He was my best friend. You're not supposed to lose your best friend at my age. You're not supposed to lose him ever! Look, Stewie, I know it doesn't seem like it now, but you're gonna be okay. Yeah, right. How do you know? Because, I once had a thing happen to me with some stuff. Really? That's what's happening to me. Stuff. You know, before you guys found me at the shop, I lived with an old man named Leo. It was just him and me in a tiny apartment, and we got pretty tight. He kind of became my whole world. By the time he passed away, it was real tough. So, how did he die? He tried to go to a yoga class, and on the first pose, his ball sack split in half. Really? Yeah, it was on Dateline. It was a whole thing. Anyway, I guess Leo was kind of like my Brian. Well, so, how'd you get over him? Well, I met your family in the pet store. When I saw you guys looking for a dog, I kind of sensed you were all going through the same feelings of loss that I was. And it made me think, hey, maybe I was meant to find these guys. Maybe we were meant to be together. You know what, Vinny? I'm starting to think that may be true. Bring it in, Stewie. Hey, Stewie, now that we're pals, maybe you can answer me something. Why does your living room smell so much like puke? Somebody throw up a lot in there once? Vinny, my friend, you got a lot of stories to catch up on. I got most of them on DVD. Oh, cool. Like, by season and stuff? No, not by season. Boy, I can't remember the last time Stewie fell asleep this early. Well, I think the little guy had a long day. All right, come on, time for bed, Vinny. I'll tell Peter to turn off the nightlight this time. No! I need it for in case there's witches! You know, actually, Lois, I think I'm gonna sleep in here with Stewie tonight. Oh, well, isn't that nice. Sleep tight, you two. Good night, Vinny. Good night, Stewie. Hey, you guys know which room is Peter's? Across the hall. Ah, it's too bright in there. Never mind."

Piggy, I don't think Kermie Jr. is doing so well. Kill me! I'm in constant pain! hey, Quagmire. Hey, Peter, do you mind if I hang out here a while? I accidentally made eye contact with a transvestite at a bar, and he followed me home. You knew what you were staring at! Get out of here, you mess! You were far away! I didn't know what you were! You know you want me! Shut up! Now go home! Nobody saw me come here! I said, shut up! Sneak around back. Oh, sure. Come on in, Quagmire. Oh, you don't have to take your shoes off. Our house sucks. So, Quagmire, if you're some kind of big ladies' man, how come I never see you wearing a necklace? I, uh that's not really my thing. I'll get you one. Please don't. Hey, come on! The guy wants to get you a necklace, let him get you a necklace! Ah! Ah! There's a bee in here! Can you take it up here? Wow, we sound amazing together! I know! That was incredible! You know, we should do something with this. Yeah, maybe we could open up a mattress store. Or we could try singing. Yeah, singing, that's good! Wow, finally, something in my life that makes me feel special. I mean, except for when I had those cow udders. So, as you can see, the fiscal projections for the fourth quarter make this thing a slam dunk. Any questions? Not about my cow udders. All right, then, looks like we got ourselves a deal. This is cause for celebration. I don't care, I'm not driving. Okay, what do you got for a lyric? ""I put a booger on a painting at the museum."" Is that is that anything? Maybe, maybe. All right, I got one.  Alyssa Milano  I knew you were gonna be hot  When you were nine. How about this?  Every food tastes good with melted cheese   I like twins, unless they're Siamese.  There you go! Now we're jazzin'.  Don't store your condoms in your billfold   Those things don't work if they get dry and old   Broken rubber  Broken rubber! Guys, I'm trying to do something up here that works better if I don't hear men singing! Oh, damn, we're out of paper. Oh, we'll get some more down at Mort's. But, Quagmire, we are on fire here! We're gonna be the best thing since sliced bread! I'd like a sandwich, but I don't feel like eating two whole loaves of bread. Tough! Hey, do you mind paying for this? I don't have any cash. Sure, I'll just put it on my credit card. I'm never gonna pay it back anyway.  'Cause I have $30,000 in credit card debt   When they call, I tell them   I can't pay it back yet  Credit card debt  Tomorrow I may buy myself  A dining room set Or this Boba Fett!  Credit card debt, credit card debt   Credit card debt. What is that sound? It's like two Mandy Patinkins walked into my store! Was that you guys singing? Yeah. That was beautiful. And it must be original, because I know every song about money, and I've never heard that one before. Well, it was based on actual events. Although, I-I don't have as cavalier an attitude toward my debt as the song suggests. I'm-I'm actually up most nights with severe panic attacks. I-I've taken to throwing up in the yard so my wife won't hear me. Well, you guys have got something special with those harmonies. They could give me five years salary, tax free, and it wouldn't put a dent in my problem. You really think we're good? Oh, yeah. And I should know. Back in the 1970s, I used to have my own record label, Mort Town. I managed all the hottest disco acts. I even managed Earth, Wind, Fire & Pollen for a little while, but I had to give it up.  Do you remember  The 21st night of September?  Oh! September is the worst month for pollen! I had it all. But it soon all came to a very ugly end. How come? I got addicted to olives. They were everywhere. It was so easy to get your hands on them. It was awful. I lost weight, my hair straightened, even my voice changed. I didn't recognize the man I saw in the mirror. What has happened to you, Mort Goldman? You've hit rock bottom. I'm lucky to be alive today. Anyway, you guys got the talent, but what you need is a manager. Someone with no talent who can take a lion's share of your earnings. You'd do that for us? Sure I would. So, what do you say? Can I be your manager? You betcha! All right! Put her there! No, I've seen your prescriptions. Let's just say we're doing it. Well, Mort, I hope I can trust you. I've been lied to before. Well, I'm off to work. Bye, guys! Love you! Love you, too! Bye! Love you! Love you, Pop! He bought it! What an idiot! I hate him so much I'm shaking! All right, fellas, open mic at the library. Your first gig. Go get 'em! Hey, do I have time to get a drink at the water fountain where the water does not crest above the dispenser? Sure. I can taste the previous person's cough. Fellow cardholders, please put your hands together for Griffin and Quagmire!  I can't poop in strange places   Strange places  I can only poop in my home   It's as though I'm watched by strange faces   Strange faces  It's why I never roam Excuse me, I just want to grab one of those newspapers. Just grab one and go! I'm looking for a job, okay?!  I've left Stewie alone with strangers   Strangers  To satisfy my fecal needs   I've put my whole family in danger   To poop before my anus bleeds   Home bowl, home bowl  You know just what I need  Home bowl, home bowl  Poop before my anus bleeds. Aw, everybody left. Well, this was a waste of time. I could have gone hiking with the girls. We don't hike. We just wear tight pants and get coffee. Well, I guess no one cares about our music. I thought we were pretty good. Yeah, I've seen worse performances. I was walking home around It was very dark, and then I-I heard the footsteps Boo! Get to the sex! Guys, I got great news! Oh, what is it, Mort? I put your performance on JewTube. The promoters of the New England Music Festival saw it, and they want to book you! What?! Are you kidding me?! Oh, my God, you hear that, Quagmire? We're on our way! We got to celebrate like girls in their 20s! Oh, my God, we are so random! You got booked at the New England Music Festival? Oh, my God, Peter, that's amazing! I had no idea you and Quagmire could even sing! Now let this be a lesson to you kids. If you randomly stumble upon an amazing talent, and then someone important sees it by wild coincidence, great things can happen without any hard work. I'm gonna go jump off the roof and see if I can fly! That's it, Chris, pursue your dream! A singer, huh? You as good as the guys who sing ""Happy Birthday"" at Macaroni Grill? Oh, don't compare me Look, they been doing it for years. Imagine, my Peter, the big singing star! Don't forget about us squares back at home. Don't you worry, Lois. No one has stronger marriages and more well-adjusted kids an rock stars. It's working! What you doing with that doll? Oh, hello, Vinny. Rupert and I are just having a spritzer and some cheese in advance of the performance. I wouldn't do that. Why not? You know, there was a guy on my old block, Johnny Chickstuff. We called him that because he used to like to, uh Do chick stuff? Do chick stuff! Exactly. Anyway, a bunch of us got together and beat him with a grill lid and windshield wipers, and let's just say, uh, he don't do chick stuff no more. 'Cause of the beatin's? Yeah. He wasn't exactly like us, so we had to almost kill him. That sounds terrible. What happened to him? I don't know. Soon thereafter, a girl in the neighborhood married a black guy, so we all kind of turned our attention to that. Look at us, Quagmire. We're making music, living the dream. And to think, just last week, my only creative outlet was picking hockey fights at work. Griffin, I need these shipping reports filled out by 5:00 today. Hey, Peter, I just wanted to wish you good luck. Oh, that's great. Thank you so much. What's your name, honey? It's me, Lois. All right, backstage whore, here's the key to my hotel room. You can flush the dump I left in there. What?! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Griffin and Quagmire! Peter, we're on!  Have you ever put butter on a Pop-Tart?   It's so frickin' good  Have you ever put butter on a Pop-Tart?   If you haven't, then I think you should   I was sittin' in the kitchen one day   And I was itchin' to fill up my belly   With the pipin' hot jelly  Of the best damn treat in the world  He's talking Pop-Tarts!  And I saw a stick of butter and it almost made me shudder   And scream like a baby girl  I don't want a giant penis or a rocket trip to Venus   I don't want to win the lottery   I just want to squat and gobble   Till I'm dizzy and I wobble  In a butter, fruit and dough tart dream   So I put butter on a Pop-Tart   It was so frickin' good  Have you ever put butter on a Pop-Tart?   If you haven't, then I think you should  Everybody come along with us!  Have you ever put butter on a  Pop-Tart!  It's so frickin' good Yeah!  Have you ever put butter on a  Pop-Tart!  If you haven't  Then I think you should. Pop-Tart! With butter?! Hey, you guys were great. Aw, thanks. My name's Ricky. I'm with Sony Records. Our company's gonna be around for at least three more weeks, and we want to sign you. I'll need to discuss this with my associate. I don't know, it-it seems wrong to just dump Mort. He's our friend. Doesn't that matter? Quagmire, you remember I told you about that dream I drew? Yeah? We're halfway there. I think if we do this, we'll get the giraffe. Okay, okay, I'm in. You got a deal. Great! I'm gonna get you on tour. This is the beginning of something big. Great news, guys! I may have gotten you booked at a horse's birthday party. Mort, you're fired. What? Sorry, Mort, but this is a cutthroat business. And we need someone tough in our corner. Like Indonesian kickboxer Agoos Bahnwati. Come on. Come on. Come on, come on. Disappear, disappear. Come on. Come on. Peter, I heard you fired Mort. He's your friend. He's the one that got you to where you are today. Lois, my transcendent talent got me to where I am. Peter, I don't like what success is doing to you. Yeah, well, I don't like what time is doing to you. Droop, droop Hey, Chris, you ready with my luggage? Luggage? For what? We're going on tour, Lois. Here you go, Dad. I emptied this out so it'd be easier to carry. Oh, you're right, it is easier. Good thinking, son. All right, see you guys in two months. Peter, you can't go away for two months now. You'll miss Thanksgiving. I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to choose between music and family. If I choose family, does it have to be this family? Yes, Peter, this family. So make your choice. Very well, this scavenger hunt will provide you with my answer. Here it is-- a penny from 1858! We're getting closer to our answer. Wake up, Mom! He chose the music! You know, Quagmire, I feel kind of bad leaving the family like this with Thanksgiving coming up. I mean, if I'm not there, who's gonna carve the turkey? I don't understand!  On a tour of one-night stands   My suitcase and guitar in hand   And every stop  Is neatly planned for a poet   And a one-man band.  Everyone from Florida is stupid   Everyone from Florida is dumb   I might not be the brightest guy   But next to them, my IQ's high   If they had guitars, here's how they'd strum   Why the hell do you brush your teeth at work?   Why the hell do you brush your teeth at work?   The bathroom's full of poop and pee   And now you've rubbed that on your teeth   Like you're gonna kiss someone at 3:00.   Get out of the left lane  You stupid Asian bitch  I don't even know why you are there.   I  Have become  Comfortably numb. Okay, Mr. Griffin. Now you've got your flu shot. Will you stop giving him flu shots, man? We got a show to do! Ah, Quagmire, it's cool, it's cool. This is the doctor that killed Michael Jackson. Yesterday, I learned the difference between a train and a boat. I wrote this song before that.  Train on the water  Boat on a track  Train on the water  Boat on a track  My lady took a train across the Atlantic   I hope it don't sink like the Titanic   I went to the station, caught a boat downtown   I hope it don't fall off the track and I drown  Ladies and gentlemen, the All-Five-Foot-One Black Albino Choir!  Train on the water  Boat on a track  Train on the water  Boat on a track.  This waitress is prettier than my wife   I could kill my family with a knife   We'll sail around the world by ship   I'll give my whole wad as a tip   But first I'll kill my family with a knife   Yes, he's gonna kill his family with a knife   Irregardless of this waitress, I will kill them with a knife.  Hold it, hold it. Stop the tape! You gonna fart in this airtight booth all night? It wasn't me. We're the only two people in here! Hey, Bobby, can you play back Peter's track?  This waitress  Is prettier than my wife Ah! Thank God. Come on, guys, you've been bickering all ni Oh, God! We got the album covers that Peter approved. Wait, wait, Peter, you approved these without consulting me? Don't worry, they're great. I can be giggity. I can be goo. I can be giggity. I can be goo. Hey, Quagmire, wake up. I got us twins. Peter, those are guys. Hell, yeah, the Winklevoss twins. They have good ideas we can steal. Peter, quit screwing around! We're about to go on national television. Now, please welcome our very special musical guests, Griffin and Quagmire. Wait, Quagmire, you got something on your face. Aah! Damn it, Peter, that was my eyebrow! Let's not make a scene. We're on TV.  You never should look at your mother's boobies   No matter how big and round they are   You'll end up seeing something you don't wanna   It's guaranteed to leave a mental scar   You never should look at your daddy's penis   When he's walking down the hall on Sunday morn   An acorn in a nest of twigs, and underneath two fetal pigs   It'll make you wish you weren't even born   Parents are gross, parents are gross   Parents are gross, parents are gross  Come on, you. Get out of there. My pick's in here. Come on! Come Uhp, uhp, it just skipped right over the strings! Yup, there it goes again. I saw it! I totally saw it! All right, that's it! We're done! Do you hear me? I quit! Hey, y-your makeup lady was crying earlier. Wh-What was that about? This is my time. Don't ever talk to me during my time! Well, kids, happy Thanksgiving. I wish Dad was here. Meg, could you zip up your fly? Th-That's kind of wafting over here.  I can't poop  In strange places Peter? Dad? Oh, boy. Larry, you got to get out of here. It's been a great two months! Meg, keep painting!  I'm so sorry that I left my family   And that I decided to roam. Peter, what are you doing here? Me and Quagmire kind of had a falling out. And after that, I-I realized I Meg, can you please stop stuffing your face for two seconds? Look, I'm sorry for being a jerk, and letting a little fame go to my head. I just hope you guys can forgive me. Oh, Peter. I missed you so much. Oh, we missed you, too. But I understand. You had to go chase your dream. And a part of me is glad you did. But now I'm just happy that you're home. Welcome home, Dad! So, did you get a lot of trim on the road, Dad? Chris, that's inappropriate. Hey, you got room for another? Quagmire? I thought you were still out on the road. I was, but then I thought, what was Simon without Garfunkel? Wildly successful? Yeah, but all that success would mean nothing if I lost my best friend. Do you do you think you can forgive me? Oh, Quagmire. Well, I'm glad to have you back home for Thanksgiving, Peter. And I'm glad to be here. 'Cause everyone knows that life after being famous is even better than it was before. Let me just grab my stuff off the bus."
Family Guy s13e01 Episode Script            ,"


                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  We now return to the All in the Family and Modern Family crossover episode. Hello, Mr. Bunker. We brought some hummus. Oh, yeah, I knew them two was hummus the minute they walked in the door. Yay! A crossover always brings out the best in each show! It certainly doesn't smack of desperation. The priorities are always creative, and not driven by marketing or Okay, that's enough. Oh, my God! What is it, Peter? Look at this. Dennis the Menace is just shoveling snow. He's being helpful. Might as well just call it Dennis now. He's not a menace. Not every strip is gonna be hilarious. You know something? I could do better than these idiots. I should just go down to the paper and sell 'em my own. Well, Peter, you might be underestimating the difficulty of writing a comic strip. As someone who occasionally dates the creative muse, I can vouch for the unforgiving face of a blank sheet of paper. In fact, I think it was William Faulkner who said I'm back. I'm published. Check it out. I call my comic For Pete's Sake, because it points out things that make you shake your head and say, ""For Pete's sake."" This one's for tomorrow. These are good, Peter. I like how you retell tired old gags with a detached, ironic approach. Yeah, plus, it's all brand-new jokes that I'm really, really serious about. Well, good for you, Peter, but how did you get published so quickly? Ah, the editor of the paper owed me a favor. I got him a picture of Spider-Man. Why can't anyone get me a picture of the Spider-Man?! Here you go. Yeah, I got a whole subreddit of superhero thong shots. Here's your beer, Peter. Thanks, Jerome. What do I owe you? Nah, you already paid me in laughs. I do a lot of island ones. Peter, you should do one where a baseball player can't steal second, 'cause he's on probation. For drug crimes. Political. Yeah, you put an island in there, you're in business. Hey, how about one where you draw a sock, and it says ""Sock it to me,"" or-or maybe draw Lois taking a hot-tub dump, and she just says whatever? Peter, your comic in this morning's paper is really offensive. That's not funny, Peter. Ah, you're just not getting it, Lois. See, his wife washed dishes for him. Oh, for Pete's sake. Aha! There you go. Peter, you should see this. Your dishwasher cartoon has really outraged the online community. What? Gosh, it's not like the Internet to go crazy about something small and stupid. Peter, you have to apologize. What, because of a joke? Not just a joke, Peter. A joke that angered some bloggers. Well, I guess this ain't the first time I got in trouble for something I said about a woman. Oh, good. We can steal. And welcome back to The Flow. We're talking to Peter Griffin, the artist behind For Pete's Sake, which has caused outrage with a misogynistic comic. Here's a video of some outrage. Boo! Yeah, those boos don't hurt so much 'cause you spent two minutes of the last segment applauding a red velvet cake. Ah! And if that's not bad enough, this morning's cartoon is even worse. Let's put that up. Mr. Griffin, do you really think this is an appropriate cartoon to run on Gloria Steinem's half-birthday? You sound angry. Did one of your friends get engaged? You have no idea how offensive you are to women, do you? What?! I love women. I bet I can name more porn stars than you. But-but don't tell my wife how many porn stars I know. I'll get in a lot of trouble. I know all of 'em, though. There are people who just started an hour ago, and I know 'em. Your cartoon is sexist! Down with misogyny! It wasn't even funny, and I have a great sense of humor. Man, they seem really upset. I was just trying to make people laugh. Dad, I'm worried they're gonna hurt us. No, no, they're angry, Chris, but they ain't gonna get violent. Oh, cool! That brick I ordered. Wait a minute. I didn't order this brick. You may be right, Chris. Peter, this is getting out of hand. I don't feel safe in my own home. Maybe we should get out of Quahog for a while. You know, she's right. We should get out of town till this all blows over. Okay, we'll go, but just give me a minute. I just want to turn in my last For Pete's Sake. going out on top amid a flurry of gambling rumors. Peter, where are we? I don't know. I just woke up, too. I tied the steering wheel to my belt. I figure we've been on the road about 20% of the time. Dad, how long until we can go back home? Um, I don't know. How long do women hold grudges? Not very long, I'm guessing. Oh, Peter, we've been driving all night. Pull over to that gas station. We can use the bathroom and stretch our legs. You got it, babe. Did you call me ""babe""? I did. Oh, Peter. Ew! Mom! You'll never have this, Meg. All right, back in the car, kids. For this leg of the trip, I was thinking of driving with my shirt off like New Mexico trash. Oh, my God! Our car! Someone's stealing it. Ah, crap. Although, I got to say, you never get to see somebody else driving your car. It's kind of cool. Kind of weird. We're stuck here, Peter! And we don't even know where we are. Well, there's a sign. Huh, guess we're in a town called Springfield. Springfield, eh? What state? I can't imagine we're allowed to say. Well, this Springfield place seems nice. We should visit here again. I don't know, Lois. This seems like a one-shot deal. Guys, we ain't here for fun, all right? We're here to find the police, report our stolen car. Oh, and don't drink the water. Everybody around here looks like they have hepatitis. Dad, I'm starving. Can we get some food?! Lois, whip out your boob, give the boy his lunch. Listen to the man. Yeah, Lois, listen to the man. How about we just go into that store there? Uh, uh, excuse me? Hello. Welcome to the Kwik-E-Mart. Oh, I am so sorry. Let me unplug that. Oh, such a nuisance! Hello, funny-sounding Cleveland. What's the specialty of the house? To you, I recommend the donut. Ooh! Yum! Have you guys seriously never heard of donuts? These are made fresh every day. And then, several days later, we receive them and make them available for purchase. Hey, are these are these free? 'Cause I forgot to mention, all our money is in our stolen car. Thank you. Come again. Sir, we can pay you back for the donuts when we find our car. Do you think that I am moved by your sob story? I come from a country where the words for ""sewage"" and ""beverage"" are the same. I'll pay for their donuts. Thank you so much, sir. For what? I didn't say anything. Oh. It was me. How come this convenience store has so many shadowy parts? Apu, a dozen donuts for our albino visitors. Wow! For real?! No man should be so poor he cannot pay for a donut. I was once you. I couldn't afford donuts. Tell them what I did, Apu. He stole the donuts. I stole the donuts. So, here you go. eight donuts. That's very nice of you, Mister? Simpson. Homer Simpson. We're the Griffins. Peter, Lois, Stewie, and then, uh, you know, the others. Brian, I guess. Well, enjoy your six donuts. Mmm. Yummy donut. That's pretty good, but try it like this. Mmm. Donut. Mmm. Donut. I think you and I are gonna get along just okay. Yeah, all right, we'll be there. But if you want to save us a little time, you can start tracing his body with chalk. This is the police station. Be careful. I think some of them might be cops. Oh, hey there. Cool hat, weird nose. Hey, listen, my car got stolen. I was hoping you could help. Well, we got a procedure for handling alleged crimes around here. Let's see. Uh, did you contribute to the policeman's ball? No. Oh, that's too bad, 'cause he really needs one. He had an accident last week. Yeah, I tried to jump over a parking meter. Yeah, all right, well, with no contribution, your report goes right into the circular file. I got to be honest. I don't usually check this file, so it might be a while until we find that car of yours. Uh, Chief, that excuse to leave you asked for is here. Oh, sorry, I got to take this. It never ends. Oh, thank you so much for putting us up until we find our car. And thank you for not being a band of hippie murderers. And now this again. You bring home two bands of hippie murderers, and suddenly, that's all you're about. Well, what do you say we have some lunch? Where's Bart? Well, he's at camp all week. I'm sorry you won't get to meet him. Got kicked out of camp. I superglued my counselor's butt cheeks together. That's terrible. But how did you even get access to his butt cheeks? I'm not the only one who got kicked out of camp. This is Bart. Honey, your hands are filthy. Go wash up for lunch. Eat my shorts! ""Eat my shorts."" I love that! Is that a popular expression, like ""what the deuce""? Probably more popular. Probably probably way more popular. Well, here's my room. Hey, you want to see my weapons closet? You have a weapons closet, too? Ouch! Jesus heard my mean thought! A slingshot! It's so simple and pure. He doesn't need lasers or time machines, just gum balls and marbles and balls of string. He's like something out of Mark Twain! Whose real name was Samuel Clemens. How how does that further this conversation? Hey, you want to make a prank phone call? Ooh, prank phone call! Moe's Tavern. Moe speaking. Uh, yeah, I'm looking for a friend, last name Keebum, first name Lee. Uh, hang on, I'll check. Hey, guys, do I got a Lee Keebum? Come on, look at the stools-- is there a Lee Keebum? Somebody check the rear-- I know I got a Lee Keebum. Then you probably shouldn't be handling food. Oh, my God, that's amazing! That's the coolest thing ever! Hey, I want to try. Okay. Moe's Tavern. Hello, Moe? Your sister's being raped. Is that is that one? So, this is my room. Please excuse the mess. There, that's better. Look at all these trophies! There must be, like, 20 of them! a lot of trophies of your own. No. I'm not good at anything. Oh, Meg, I'm sure you're good at something. We just have to find out what it is. After all, Nelson Mandela said it's our obligation to shine. You mean like my oily face and back? No. Maybe don't sit on my bedspread, please. But I mean the light within you that makes you an individual. Meg, you need to know that you matter. Really? No one's ever told me I mattered before. That's why you have to say it. So say it. I matter. Louder! I matter! Shut up, Meg! You don't matter! Hey, couldn't help but notice there's no seat for me. Oh. I was under the impression that you were a dog. You're right to have that reaction, Marge. Why, I just figured, at home I sit with the family, so I assumed that Have you ever drunk out of a toilet? I-I don't see what that has to do with the discussion. Dogs eat in the kitchen. Yeah, dogs eat in the kitchen. Y-You know, you're eating mostly horse hooves and tallow, right? You cool with that? Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, you do. So, is that is that, like, your thing? You eat loud? I I'm-I'm sorry, I don't know what That's a gutter language. Are you making friends in there, Brian? Yep, he's a lot of laughs. Wow, you work at a nuclear power plant? What's that? I don't know. Pretty impressive. I just work at a brewery. Oh, my God, you get to work with beer?! Wow! What's beer really like? Eh, he's got a big head. Hey, you know-- aw, damn it, I don't have a comic strip anymore. So, still no word from the police on your stolen car? The cops here are a joke. I bet you and me can find your car on our own. You think so? Yeah. 'Cause Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin are a great team! A greater team than Than Uh-huh, keep going. Than something else. Something else? I don't know what this is. O-Okay, I'll do it. Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin are an even greater team than the Air Force! Hold steady. I got him in my sights. Whoo-hoo! Yeah-heh-heh! Yeah, we did it. What's he doing here? We got to carry him, 'cause he can't fly on his own. We let that other guy try, and look what happened. No, no, no, no, no, no! Wow, they've made a lot of changes to Quahog! Chris, we're in a different town. Oh Is that why there was blood in my stool? No. That-that sounds like a separate issue. God, I can't believe I got stuck taking their stupid dog for a walk. Stupid? Well, I don't know, I think he's kind of fun. What, are you kidding? He doesn't do anything. You know, it's not his fault, though. He doesn't know any better. He's been on a leash his whole life. Hey, you know what? Come here, Santa's Stupid Name. You're a grown dog-- start acting like one. Come here, boy. Hey, stop that dog! Sorry. We're on a smoke break. Nothing beats smoking and standing. Although smoking and sitting does have its moments. You always have to argue with me. Oh, thank goodness! I was starting to think you wouldn't show, Dr. Dog. Boy, you really like to bleed, huh, guy? Hey, there's a dog in the dining area! How'd that happen? Get back in there. Which one is Santa's Little Helper? I don't know. You're the one who sniffed his butt. Yeah, for, like, a second! Damn it, he's gone. We're screwed. Welcome to Krusty Burger. May I take your order? Your voice sounds stupid. Oh, my God, that was great! I mean, unless you think it sucked, in which case it sucked. It was all right, dude. Yeah, dude. So, you know, um, I'm only wearing this diaper as a dare, you know-- it's not, like, an everyday thing. Hey, loser, I copied off your spelling test and got a D! Haw-haw! I say, how long has that boy been treating you like that? Uh about 24 years. Aah! Just who I was looking for! Cowabunga. All right, Peter, if we're gonna find your car, we got to think like a car. So let's fill up at that gas station. I feel sick. Keep drinking. I prepaid 40 bucks! Homer, maybe we're doing this wrong. Oh, crap. Haben Sie Homer und Peter MIT Chevron pump? Okay, I got a great idea how we're gonna find my stolen car. We'll throw a car wash-- free for stolen cars! And then when we find it, we'll actually charge the guy! Well, none of these is my car, but we promised these scumbags a show.  Love is like a bomb, baby, come on, get it on   Livin' like a lover with a radar phone   Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp   Demolition woman, can I be your man?   Yeah!   So come on, take a bottle   Shake it up   Break the bubble   Break it up   Pour some   Sugar on me   Ooh, in the name of love   Pour some   Sugar on me   Come on, fire me up   Pour your   Sugar on me   I can't get enough  Hey, Chief, we could arrest every single car thief in Springfield. After the show, Lou, after the show. I don't know! I feel like I'm good at nothing! Hey, everyone gets down on themselves sometimes. Those are the days I'm glad I have my saxophone. Saxophone? Yeah. My dad gave it to me. My dad once gave me a gun to hide. That's terrible. Whenever I feel any pain or loneliness, I just play away the blues on my saxophone. Huh. I usually just beat up a cat. Good thing we don't have a cat. Why don't you give it a shot? Was that good? It was okay, but it would be a shame to waste such great butcher's arms on a musical instrument. Wakey, wakey. Good morning. You and I have quite a day ahead of us. Oh, that's a clown I painted, so you know I'm truly insane. You know, Nelson, I don't doubt that you've had a twisted childhood. Most evil people have. Hitler, Manson, Jaden Smith. But you're different from them, aren't you? Because they're rail-thin, and you're fat. You're a little piggy, aren't you, Nelson? In fact, I bet you're hungry right now. What's that? I could eat. Good. Because you're going to eat my shorts. Homer, you're never going to believe what we did. We saw a movie in the afternoon! Yeah, we saw Surf's Up 2. Marge covered her eyes every time the penguins surfed. It made me nervous. They could drown. Hey, where's Santa's Little Helper? Brian, you took him for a walk, right? Uh, yeah, yeah. More-more like he took me for a walk. God, what a what a fun dog. He's in the kitchen right now, totally accounted for. Shut up. I'll, uh I'll go check on him right now. And Chris will come with me. But nobody else! BRIAN Ruff! Ruff, ruff! Ah, there he is! Aw, you like that behind the ear, don't you, boy? Ruff! Ruff, ruff! Ruff, ruff! I'm another dog in here! What the hell are you doing? He's having a dog playdate. How does that help us? We're creating a broad story. Also, Matthew McConaughey is in here, too! ""All right, all right, all right."" No, no, he's-he's not really in here! He's We-we thought it was him, but it was just the oven! Now you're just doing voices. Jack Nicholson?! Okay, Santa's Little Helper got all tuckered out from his playdate, so he went out back to take a nap under that tree where nobody knows quite where it is. Hey, what happened to Jack Nicholson and that other dog? Yep. Wait, aren't you supposed to be looking for our car? Didn't find the car, Lois, but I found a good time with a good pal. Right, Homer? Hey, Quagmire who, right? Yeah, Quagmire who? That's an actual question. I don't know who Quagmire is. Peter, I'm glad you made a friend, but what about our car? Yeah, I got an idea about that. What's the one surefire way to find a lost car? Giant magnet? Giant magnet. Giant magnet? Check. Giant plug? Check. Giant curbside outlet? Oh, things never work the way they do on the box. Okay, let's get this garbage out of the street. Oh, dear, I was using that car as pants. Oh, my God, Dad, it's our car! That confused old guy must have been driving it by mistake. How many confused old guys you got in this town? I'm old, so I'm the victim! Well, Homer, thanks for helping me get my car back. And to show my appreciation, I got a little something for you. Here you go. Pawtucket Patriot Ale. The best Quahog has to offer. Always keep an emergency six-pack in my trunk. Oh, that's cool, bringing outside beer into my bar. Down the hatch! That's pretty good, right? No. Huh? It's not good. This beer tastes exactly like Duff. It's just a lousy rip-off. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! It's not a rip-off of Duff. It may have been inspired by Duff, but I-I like to think it goes in a different direction. No, this is just the same as Duff, but, like, worse. Hey, come on, now, this is my favorite beer you're talking about. Hell, I work for the company. It's my livelihood. Oh, yeah? Well, your livelihood is based on fraud. Look at this. Huh? It is Duff. Your beer is in big trouble! You can't just slap a new label on something and call it your own! Well, maybe Duff should be in trouble for, you know, not being that great. Duff is an icon! Yeah, but some folks prefer Pawtucket Pat. I mean, don't get me wrong, I-I used to love Duff when I was younger, but I-I haven't even had it in, like, 13 years. Be that as it may, I represent the Duff Brewery, and you, sir, as a representative of Pawtucket Patriot Ale, are being sued for intellectual theft and patent infringement. Aha! Intellectual theft! What do you have to say about that, Griffin? D'oh! The Pawtucket Patriot Brewery being sued? It's the largest employer in Quahog, Peter. A lot of people's jobs are riding on this. Yeah, I got a job for you riding on something. Peter! Sorry! Sorry, Lois, I'm-I'm tired 'cause we usually only do these things for half an hour. Simpson. Griffin. Nice day, isn't it? A nice day for stabbing a friend in the back. Yeah, and a nice day for bringing thieves to justice. We're getting a lot of compliments. Yep, we're doing something right. Your Honor, citizens of Springfield and visitors from Quahog, my client, the Duff Brewery, is the victim of flagrant intellectual theft. I'm whispering in court to look smart. But it's not just the main Duff recipe that's been plagiarized. Several other Duff variations, packages and design elements have been similarly infringed, resulting again and again in pale imitations, chp coes, clumsy counterfeits and weak substitutions. You like sex? Eh. I don't think we're very similar. You know why they got us sitting next to each other. Uh, 'cause we're the two funniest guys in our towns? Damn right. I'm a Jewish clown. Me, too. Are you a mayor? Yes, I am. Are you a ""cool"" mayor? I, uh I like to think so. You lived in Springfield? Yeah, I worked at the Kwik-E-Mart, researching a role. These guys are gonna lose. I've heard all I need to hear to make a decision. If you ask me, neither of these beers is wholly original. They're both pale imitations of my favorite beer, Bud Rock. - Oh, ho, ho! - Ooh! But rendering a verdict is something I'm paid to yabba-dabba-do! Eh. And I find in favor of Duff. Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no! Hello? Uh, hey. I'm-I'm in the wrong Springfield. So what's going to happen now? Well, the Pawtucket Brewery will be shut down, so I guess we got to go back to Quahog and find Peter a new job. Mmm, that's too bad. Yeah. Anyways, it was still nice to meet you and your family, even though you kind of screwed us over. Good to have you. And, hey, next time you stay with a family, maybe you can wear a bra some of the time. Hey, uh, Marge, uh, listen, there's something difficult that I've been trying to figure out how to tell you, and, um it's about, uh, Santa's Little Helper. What about him? He's, um right there. You were trying to figure out a way to tell me that? I overthink things sometimes. Oh, and, look, he's with Ed McMahon! Hey-o! Here's Johnny! Chris, we're done. You may be, but ""I'm just getting warmed up!"" That's Al Pacino. Thanks for being so cool, Lisa. I cut your name in my arm so I'll always remember you. Meg, I want you to have this. Your saxophone? Yes, Meg. When you played the saxophone, Lisa, no one has ever done anything this nice for me. You're amazing, and I will never be like you. I'm not pretty, I'm not smart, I'm not talented. I have the same shoe size as Charles Barkley. My prom date was a scarecrow I stole, and he left with someone else. The inside of my hat smells so bad I'm not allowed in most restaurants Hey, hey! Shut up, Meg. No luggage. Car's full. Let's go. Well, nice knowing you, Stewie. Same here, Bart. Hey, I hope you don't mind, I got you a little present. Whoa. Is that Nelson? Stewie, what the deuce? Yes, I Oh! Oh, that's nice. You got that from me. 'Cause, you know, I was starting to worry this was a one-way thing. You kidnapped him? I kidnapped all your enemies. Nelson, Jimbo, Principal Skinner, Sideshow Bob, Apu. I know Apu's not your enemy, but I just wanted to say, ""I took Apu."" That is funny! But the rest of this? It's messed up, man. I know! Isn't it awesome? So, how do you want to keep in touch? Facebook? Twitter? Late-night phone calls lying on our tummies with our feet up in the air? Stewie, I don't think we can be friends. You freak me out. Bart, if we don't keep in touch, I'll kill myself. That's what I'm talking about. Later, dude! Later dude. Haw-haw! Aw. Hey, Griffin. Sorry about your job. I was just sticking up for Duff. I love Duff. And Duff loves me. Duff can keep a secret. Duff never says no. Duff is more experimental than any partner I've ever had. Anyway, the point is, I'm sorry. You know, when I first met you, I thought, hey, I love this guy! This is the funniest guy I've ever met. I'm gonna quote this guy to all my friends. I love his town, I love his family. But now, I think I speak for all of us when I say, I am over the Simpsons! Wh-What are you saying? I'm saying the Simpsons suck! Why, you Ow! What the hell? That really hurts. No, it doesn't! I do it to my son all the time. You strangle your son? That's insane! No wonder he's fat and stupid and masturbates all the time. That's your son! Phew! Hey! Knock it off! There's a kid back there! I'm in danger. Hey, that's no fair. I don't got none of them. Uh-oh. Hey, hey! Uh-oh. Ooh. Damn it! And remember, kids, TV violence is fine as long as you don't show a nipple. Perfect. The earthlings are destroying themselves. Yeah, it's really great, isn't it, guys? We went to summer camp together. Bye! Thanks for having me. Huh? It appears that I am now the only one with radioactive powers, which will allow me to unleash my fury Oh, I talked too long. - We're gonna make it! - Trust me, we're not. Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh? Whoa! Whoo-hoo! Road house. Aah-aah! Say hi to Maude Flanders. No. You say hi to Muriel Goldman. Who? What are you still doing here? I think you're gonna get a kick out of this. You're parked behind me at your place. That is funny. Hey, listen, I I'm sorry we fought. I just wanted to make you laugh and cry. You see, I'm a Family Guy. I understand. I'm a The Simpsons. Look, even if we don't work as best pals, I respect you. You, too. Let's just agree to stay a half hour away from each other. With a pile of garbage between us. Worst chicken fight ever. It sure is nice to be back in Quahog. Oh, and thank God all the commotion about Dad's comic blew over. Oh, my God, I had a comic? That's hilarious! Well, you may not be a cartoonist anymore, but you are a local hero for defending our beer, and apparently, that's more important than hating women. So here you go, a Pawtucket Patriot Ale. What? I don't understand. Ain't the brewery out of business? We lost a court case. Yes, we lost, but how are they gonna enforce it? What, are they gonna come here? I think we know that's never gonna happen. Hey, Stewie, I'm sorry Bart didn't want to be your friend. What? No! What are you talking about? He was lame. If you ask me, he kind of sounded like a girl. Really? Kind of seemed like you idolized him. And I can understand losing a friend and feeling rejected. Course you can! You're a loser. But not me. I'm a lone wolf. Speaking of which, I'm gonna go howl at the moon. Don't need nobody. Shh.  And now the show is over now."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Hey, guys. You look like you're getting a little red. Maybe you ought to put some sunblock on. Joe, we just got here. Oh, sorry about that. These got a little mixed up. ""Hey, glad you guys could make it!"" Ugh, look at Cleveland over there. He's obviously cleaning his feet in the pool without making it look like he's cleaning his feet in the pool. Oh, that's nice. That's a good temp. I wonder if this temp is the same on my other foot. Oh, yeah. Sure is a good day for it. Good day for these wet paint brushes, too. Is the pool too warm for paint brushes? Hey, sorry again, Kevin. I didn't see you in the tub. Huh, what's all this? Honey, it doesn't seem like the Griffins are leaving anytime too soon! Oh. Hey, Peter. Hey, Joe. What are all these pictures? Oh, nothing. They're just some stupid scribbles I've been working on for a children's book. I don't think that's stupid. I think that's awesome! I mean, my one note on these would be to hide a bunch of dongs in the backgrounds, but, otherwise, I think they're great! Wow. Well, that really means a lot to me, Peter. I've been working on this book for nine years, but I've been too afraid to show it to anybody. Come on, Joe. You can't be afraid. What if Bono had been afraid to wear sunglasses? Then nobody would know about Africa. What's it about? Well, it's called The Hopeful Squirrel. It's about a handicapped squirrel who has to learn to overcome his disabilities so he can survive in the wild. As you can imagine, it's very personal to me. Wait were you once a squirrel? No, Peter. I'm handicapped. Well, you know, you ought to do something with this. Really? You think so? Hey, trust me, Joe. I know talent when I see it. I mean, I discovered Mr. Peanut. Ordinary legume. Ordinary legume. Extraordinary peanut! Oh, man. There she is. Wha Who? That girl, right there. She comes in here every morning after her run. Ah, I'm obsessed with her. Well, why don't you go talk to her? Way ahead of ya. Wh Where are you going? And 1,000. Whew. Percent, that's what. You, uh, you in the game, too? You mean running? Uh, let me think-- what's on my trophies? Uh yes! You're losing her! Hey, I'm Brian. Hi, I'm Chloe. Nice to meet you. Hey, uh, you wouldn't maybe want to grab a bite to eat sometime, would you? That sounds great. Awesome. You know, see, this is how you meet people. I tried the online dating thing, but there's just too much competition out there. Short, but handsome, slightly hairy, newly single salesman. Short, but handsome, slightly hairy, newly single salesman. Short, but handsome, slightly hairy, newly single salesman. Hi, I'm Al Harrington of Al Harrington's Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tube-Man Warehouse and Emporium. Due to a gut-busting divorce, limited people skills, and significant prodding from my therapist, I am currently seeking online companionship as a short, but handsome, slightly hairy, newly single salesman. And I would love to attempt to convert my heavily embellished Internet profile and carefully airbrushed, out-of-date photo, into a night of physical intimacy with you! Peter, I just heard the best news. Wow, word gets around fast. Nice, right? No. Peter, I took your advice and sent my book to a publisher. They're gonna publish The Hopeful Squirrel. And it's all thanks to you! Joe, that's amazing! So there's gonna be a real live book out there with your name on it? Well, actually, I'm writing it under a pen name-- David Chicago. Well, how come you didn't just write it under Joe S Steenburj You know, your real name? I wanted to avoid catching crap down at the police station. They don't like anything artistic. They were pretty rough on my mime act. I'm in a box. Oop, that's the back of the box. You're not supposed to talk! Well, how else are you gonna know I'm in a box?! Oh. Hi, Brian. Hey. You, uh you didn't forget about our date, did you? Of course not. I was just thinking, since it's so nice out, we could go out for a run and then eat. Oh. Yeah. N-no, no. You know, I would totally do that. I-I just I've already run, like, so many ""K"" today. Oh, come on, don't be a wimp! This way, you'll earn your dessert. Wow, this is great, isn't it, Brian? Yeah, it's awesome. Hey, uh, is your vision also reduced to just a tiny pinhole? Just push through it, Brian. Once you hit your runner's high, you'll catch your second wind. Runner's high? Yeah, my endorphins always kick in at the top of this hill. Oh, crap. Brian, this is your heart. What the hell do you think you're doing? Stop. Brian, this is your penis. Don't listen to him. We're this close to Bone City. Brian, I'm here, too. I'm hanging out with your penis and your heart. Okay, here comes the top. Chloe, I'm not sure I can I feel it. I'm feeling the runner's high.  It was a beautiful day   The sun beat down   I had the radio on  Go get 'em, Brian! By the way, the sun is really a black guy. The moon is Korean! Wow, this is amazing. I never want to lose this feeling.  Yeah, I'm running' down a dream   That never would come to me   Workin' on a mystery  Oh, Brian. That was incredible. Yeah, you hump her real good, Brian! I'm gonna go ahead and close the shades. I still see you! Hello, everyone. I'm Blake Walker from Piermont Publishing. Please join me in welcoming David Chicago. Okay, so, uh, hi, folks, and thank you all for coming. I know this would've been a great day to surf. That's not a joke! Uh, anyway, this is The Hopeful Squirrel. ""There once was a handicapped squirrel who could not climb trees to get food."" Okay, next page. ""The squirrel""-- the same squirrel from the first page-- ""hoped that the other animals would share their food with him. ""'Please,' said the Hopeful Squirrel. ""'If you could all spare just one nut, I, too, could survive the winter.'"" Sorry about that. Mommy, I don't like the wheel man. ""But none of the other animals would share with the Hopeful Squirrel."" Hey, eyes front! I'm talking! Don't tell my kid what to do. Well, maybe if you did, I wouldn't have to! Shut up! This is free! You know why it's free? 'Cause it sucks! Quagmire? I think it might be time to leave. Ah, crap, this is Joe's dream. I got to do something. Joe, what are you doing? The-the squirrel doesn't even sound hopeful. It's got to be like, ""If you could spare just one nut, I, too, could survive the winter!"" Oh, I like that voice. He's funny. That's the man who passed out at the liquor store. Joe, quick, give me the book. ""And so, the squirrel decided to climb for his own nuts. ""'I don't need legs when I've got a positive attitude and arm strength.'"" ""'I'm sorry that we mistreated you,' ""said Buddy the Badger. ""'Could you find it in your heart ""to share your nuts with us?' ""'Of course I'll share with you all,' ""said the squirrel. ""'For if I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped.'"" Wow, that was great. Who are you? Just a grown man with a pet hermit crab. Listen, Joe, how would you feel about your friend getting more involved? What do you mean? Well, you would write the books, and your friend, Peter, would be the public face of The Hopeful Squirrel. He would be David Chicago. Well, I I don't know. Joe, this happens all the time. You wouldn't believe who really writes all those Stephen King books. Scary stuff, scary stuff, scary stuff. Ding! Scary stuff, scary stuff, scary stuff. Ding! Scary stuff, scary stuff, scary stuff. Lunch! Look, Peter can get this book into the hands of every kid in America. That's what you wanted, isn't it? All right. Well, whatever you think is best for the book. Great! So it's all agreed. Can't wait to work with you, Peter. What-what just happened? Oh, the bookstore closed and is now a Target. But don't worry, our industry's fine. Excuse me, Mr. Chicago? Could you please sign my copy of your book? Sure, I Easy there, Joe. Hot Rod asked for Mr. Chicago. ""Give me all your money. I have a gun""? Oh, wait, I think I messed something up. ""Never give up on your dreams""? Listen, Peter, if you're gonna act as David Chicago, I need to know that you're gonna take this seriously and honor the message of the book. Joe, I got it. Trust me. This ain't the first time I've pretended to be someone I'm not. Gene Shalit, I am the ghost of Roger Ebert. And even in death, I'm a better critic than you. Leave me alone! Go back to hell! Gene, is everything all right? It's fine, Joanne. Go back to sleep. Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker. Welcome to another edition of Cross-Legged Chat. Our guest on today's show is local bestselling children's book author David Chicago. Welcome. Thank you. Wow, all your words are right there for you? Quite quite the imagination on this one. So, tell me, how did you decide to write about a handicapped squirrel? You know, I'd see these crippled kids limping down the sidewalk on my way to work, and I would just laugh and laugh, and I thought, ""Hey! Put that in a book!"" He's making people laugh at handicapped people. What's he doing out there?! I'll tell you what he's doing, he's selling books! They love him! Now, I understand we have some questions from the audience. Yes, I have a question. Is the Hopeful Squirrel a boy or a girl? I'm a boy! But in the book, I'm drawn smooth down there, so it's not a bad question. Okay, that's all our time. We invite you to stay tuned through the credits so you can see where I buy my clothes. So what's going on here? Just having dinner. That's Dad's chair. He's gonna be mad. Wow, Brian, you sure have been doing a lot of jogging lately. It's called ""running,"" Lois. Why don't you have some food? Oh, you mean fuel? Ah, no-no offense, Lois, but that stuff is nothing but chemicals and empty calories. Okay. I'll mush some up and put it on the floor next to the trash, if you get hungry. I think you bought girl running shoes. You know, in case any of you want to, uh, come cheer us on, Chloe and I are doing the Quahog Marathon in a couple weeks. A marathon? But-but what if that sexy boy has another bomb? Yeah, are you sure you can finish a marathon? I'm not worried, Meg. I'm just gonna give it all I've got, like Scotty engineering the Enterprise. Scotty, we need more speed! I'm giving her all she's got, Captain! She can't take any more! Damn. Chekov, reroute auxiliary power to the helm. Scotty to the bridge. Uh Captain, this uh this is a little embarrassing, but, uh, you know, I've never noticed, uh, the little lever I've been pushing, it's it's only about two-thirds of the way up. I-I actually can give her more. That's great, Scotty! Mr. Spock, give us readings on Uh, C-Captain, Scotty again. Y You're not gonna believe this. Uh, Th another   lever her. The ship can literally go three times as fast. I I'm sorry. I feel like such a capital-J jerk right now. It's okay, Scotty. Lieutenant Uhura, open all channels for Captain, I've-I've got to, uh, interrupt again. I've just been thinking about this-this ""giving her all she's got"" thing. I mean, I've been completely wrong for years now. I-I feel terrible. I mean, think of how many crises we've been in where the issue was how fast we could go. I-I mean I'm sorry, Captain. Scotty, it's okay. No, it's not! Eric's dead! At the funeral, I literally said the words to his wife, ""I was giving her all she's got."" Scotty, it's fine. Sulu, lock phasers Captain, I just got to jump in here. W-We don't have enough dilithium crystals to run the phasers I've-I've lost all credibility, haven't I? Peter, I think we need to talk. You totally screwed up my book. You're getting kids to laugh at handicapped people, when I'm trying to inspire them. I'm afraid you're off the project. What? You can't kick me off the project. I'm David Chicago! I'm the one who wrote the book. Joe, come on. Let's not kid ourselves. All right? Everybody knows my face now. And besides, I'm the only one of the two of us who can do a squirrel voice. Well, I don't know if that's quite true. Joe, Joe, stop. You're embarrassing yourself. Sorry, Joe, but the publisher loves me. The public loves me. I'm not going anywhere. Screw you, Peter! You know what? You've ruined this for me. I want nothing to do with the book, and I want nothing to do with you! Aw, one of his shoes fell off during the anger. Peter, Bonnie told me that Joe's very upset. Did you really take his book away from him? Did you just poop and then get into bed without underwear on? That book really meant a lot to Joe. I think you should talk to him. Hey, that book would've been nothing without me. And besides, he's the one who quit. Now the publisher wants another book and it's all on me! I just hate to see you two in a fight. And on the same week when my sister and I are having such a big fight, too. Good night, Lois. All right, guys. Ideas, ideas. We got a Hopeful Squirrel book to write. All right, now, who's got something? I-I got I got something. What if the squirrel has lasers that he shoots out of his eyes! Quagmire's on the board. And how 'bout he got a frog friend that's got some sort of catchphrase? Like, if he's seeing something kooky, he could be like, ""Damn, that's cray-cray in a good way, right there!"" Wow. God just speaks right through you, doesn't he, Cleveland? I believe he does. Okay, what else, what else? If there's a bison Is that a statement or a question? It is what it is. Ain't nothing gotta be nothing, huh? Hey, Stewie! Can you come in the bathroom for a second? What is it, Bri Oh, my God! Hey, could you close the gate? Couple of calves got loose. Ha, pow! Brian, you're all sinewy. Your whole body looks like Paul McCartney's neck. Thanks. That's not a compliment. You look terrible. What does your girlfriend think of this? I dumped her; she couldn't keep up with me. Hey, grab me some more Band-Aids, will you? I got, like, eight more nipples to cover up before my run. You know, whatever you're doing, it isn't healthy, Brian. Oh, I'm not healthy? Stewie, my heart rate is down to four beats a minute. Besides, I got to keep training. The marathon's in two days. Ian, I-I'm worried you're losing yourself in all this. Do you remember that phase when you thought you were a pointer dog? Was someone wearing my new high heels? You dick. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, hot moms who are married but looking David Chicago! Hey, how many of y'all bitches like to read? ""Chapter One. ""It was winter in the forest, ""so the squirrel was happy he'd built that hot tub. ""But little did he know, a strain of super gonorrhea ""was gonna hit him so fierce ""he'd wish he was still paralyzed from the waist down. ""On top of that, some son of a bitch killed his brother."" ""The monkey's kick-ass buzz saw hand ""'His brains, his brains-- they're everywhere!' the little girl yelled."" ""'Damn, that's cray-cray in a good way, right there!'"" ""exclaimed Billy the Bullfrog."" ""The woodchuck mom and her baby finished their cocoa ""and then tucked in for another cozy night. But then"" ""'Nothing but cops on the take and hookers on the make,' ""said Randy the Raccoon. ""'What's a hooker?' asked the bunny, who was gay. ""'That and a bag of crank ""is my Saturday night!' spat Randy. The end."" You're awful. That was the worst. We had trouble hearing you in the back. I'm sorry, Peter, you're fired. I'm sorry Joe's dream didn't work out for you, Peter. What was I thinking? Joe's the one with all the talent. Me trying to write a book is like CeeLo trying to find a pair of pants. Yeah, I need to find something a cartoon apple would wear. Hey, you made it! So you ready to watch me kick some ass? Brian, I think you've taken all of this too far. You know, there is such a thing as too much exercise. Stewie, I know you're worried, all right? And no offense, but I'm not taking advice from a guy who eats bread. Runners, take your marks! Oh, son of a bitch! Ow, my leg! Help me, somebody! Brian, why does everything you touch turn to garbage? Peter. Look, Joe, I messed up. All right? I just I just got so wrapped up in all the attention. The attention you deserved. I know how much this meant to you, and I I should've just stayed out of it. Listen, I'm I'm sorry I mistreated you. Okay? You deserve better. Peter, wait. If I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped. What? It's from the book, Peter. What book? I forgive you, Peter. You do? Yeah.  The truth is, I never would have had the confidence to get my book published in the first place. And that's all I ever wanted. Friends? Frasier. So, Bri, how's that ankle itch? Well, what do you mean? I'm just saying, you probably have an itchy ankle under that cast. It starts as a tickle and then you can't quite reach it? Not gonna work, Stewie. Yes, you're right. Best not to think about it. Even though it might be a little bug digging away down there, just nagging and itching and Ah, ah, crap, I did it to myself! Ah, wh is that? Well, Peter, I'm glad you made up with Joe. Yeah, me, too. It just goes to show you, Lois, books is bad news. Well, except for the books they sell at Urban Outfitters. The Single Girls' Guide to Happy Hour. Dogs Who Look Like Presidents. This one's just pictures of people reacting to farts. I like where the USA is headed."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  We now return to Hotel TV, the station that makes you feel like you're at a hotel when you're not at a hotel. Have a romantic drink by the concourse fountain. Or you can watch the big game at Chopper's Bar and Grill, where they'll be pouring till 2:00 a.m. Or maybe you're in the mood for something a little more exotic. Try Jose Gato's Brazilian Steakhouse. With rooftop views, plus a fine selection of blended rum drinks. At the end of the night, you won't want to say, ""Boa noite."" And you won't have to, 'cause Chopper's is open, where they're pouring till 2:00 a.m. Should we go to Chopper's? We interrupt this program to bring you a Chanel 5 News special report. Good evening, Quahog. I'm Tom Tucker. Tragedy stuck Haiti today as the island nation was rocked by a major earthquake, leaving thousands dead and injured. Coming up, local newsman shows a camera operator how to center a shot. There we go. There, there's Tom. There's the star. Oh, my God. That's terrible about Haiti. We got to do something to help. No, we don't. Relax. I'm sure Wyclef Jean has got it all under control. I've always talked about wanting to help in these situations, but I never follow through. Well, this time, I'm really gonna do it. I'm gonna start a blood drive. Good for you, Lois. You'll be a local hero, like Paul Revere. The British will be here soon. We shall stand our ground and fight them to the death! Yes! Yes! Although I mean, one of us should probably warn everyone. You know that the British are coming. I mean, not me. I mean, I want to fight. I mean, oh, shoot I've got the horse. I mean, but if anyone else wants to go? I'll go. No one? All right. I'll make sure everyone remembers your names! Wow, Lois, you really got a great turnout for the blood drive. Oh, yeah. The whole thing's going off without a hitch. Well, except for that mosquito who keeps trying to sneak in. Hi. I'm the new nurse. Get out of here! This blood's not for you! Aw Oh, look, an empty tire with some water in it. All right, I'm happy again. I'm gonna go ahead and thank you for donating blood today. Donating?! I thought we were getting paid! Peter, everyone else here has donated except you. That's not true. That guy over there didn't donate. That's still you, Peter. Oh. Well, if I got to donate, he's got to donate, too. You, get in here! Sucker! Son of a bitch! Lois! Lois! Mommy! Stewie, what's going on? You should be asleep by now. I can't sleep, Brian. Where's the woman? I need her to read me a bedtime story. Oh, she's busy with the blood drive. Maybe I can help. How about I read you this book? It's called Apathetic George. ""George used to be a curious monkey, ""but after a month in captivity, ""all he did was wait for food. ""The zoo people wanted him to mate, ""but he lost interest in that, too. ""20 years and millions of dollars in zoo revenue later, he died."" Okay, I've had enough. All right, you know what, I know something that will help you sleep. Wait here. Well, I hope so. Because I've tried everything. Counting sheep, thinking sleepy thoughts. I even hired the Sandman. Sand and sand and sand and sand and sand and sand and good night! Okay, I'll give you a tiny bit of this. It should help you sleep. What is it? It's cough syrup. It's not really for kids, but a capful is pretty harmless. Mmm. Oh, so this is what Lil Wayne keeps almost dying from. Ah, this is so relaxing. I could get used to this. Like the way I got used to wearing European diapers. Don't mind me. I'm just grabbing a little cheese and vino. If anybody needs me, I'll be poolside next to my weirdly hot girlfriend with dark teeth. Well, Lois, I'm done giving blood. Just ask this guy. Is true, Lois. I sucked him dry. He gave a blood donation as well. Peter, knock it off. Just give some blood, get your cookie and be done with it. Cookie? Yes, Peter. There are cookies for everyone who donates. Well, I already ate two wedding cakes, but I guess I could go for a cookie. All right, I'll do it. Peter, you're doing a good thing. Thanks, Lois, but you got to promise you'll warn me before they stick that needle in me. Actually, we just finished. Wow, that wasn't so bad. See, Peter? And now you can have a cookie. Oh, awesome! Mmm. Mmm. Oh, my God, Th-these are delicious. Lois, you made these? Yeah, I found one of my grandmother's old recipes, so I thought I'd make a special batch for the blood drive. Well, I'm glad you did. These cookies are amazing. They're even tastier than Connie Britton's hair. Mmm. God, your hair is delicious. Who are you? I'm the guy who killed your bodyguard. Coming this fall to every network, your favorite sitcom lines preceded by the word ""uh."" Uh, knock much? Uh, that just happened. Uh, so I guess this is a thing now? Uh, yeah, no. Uh, awkward. TV, that thing you used to watch. Oh, these are incredible. Hey, you know something? If we sold these, we could make a ton of money. Maybe we should open our own cookie store. Are you serious? Yeah, why not? I mean, if George Foreman can make electric grills, we can do this. I mean, I've seen that guy get punched in the face a thousand times, and now he's making science stuff. Who'd think that idiot would still be walking around and Muhammad Ali can't even talk anymore? You know, having our own store could be kind of fun. And you'd really do it with me? Absolutely. Oh, Peter, that actually sounds kind of romantic. I always wanted you and me to work on a project together. Oh, let's do it! All right! Now, let's turn up the TV real loud so the kids can't hear us having sex. Aah! Aah! Sex! Sex! There's my handsome business partner. Now, we can't be late for our meeting with the bank. That's so cool you guys are gonna open a business. Yeah, well, I got a ton of business experience. I mean, I had that job creating ads for the North Dakota board of tourism. Hi. Do you like South Dakota but don't want to see Mount Rushmore? Come to North Dakota. It's just a very long drive from wherever you live. Best of all, most of the good license plates aren't taken yet. Imagine coming here and having ""Cool Dude"" or ""Yay Jews"" or ""Boo Jews,"" depending on where you stand on Jews. North Dakota. We're not even the best Dakota. Stewie, what are you doing? Huh? Oh, Brian, oh, there you are. I've been I've been looking all over the table for you. You know, I've got to tell you, this stuff you gave me was a lifesaver last night. I was out like a light. And, you know, normally, I'm up five or six times to scream and defecate. But you know what? I slept straight through. Stewie, I told you, there's alcohol in that. It's not for kids. You're not for kids. Stewie, you're drunk. Oh, Brian's all serious. ""Oh, I don't I don't drink in the morning because I've got to land a plane."" All right, come on, I've got to drive you to daycare. Okay, okay, it's all right. C-Calm down, calm down. Uh, uh, oh. Oh, I think I I think I've put my shoes on the wrong feet. Is it 9:15 already? Lois, we got to go! You know, I've got all the papers for the loan officer, but, I got to admit, I'm a little nervous. Don't worry, we're gonna get this loan, no problem. And if you get nervous, just do what I always do, picture your audience naked. Good afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin. Aah! Get that enormous thing out of my face! I'll be your loan officer, so why don't you have a seat and tell me about your business. Our business is cookies. Now let me ask you a question. You ever heard of money? Yes. Good, good. We're on the same page. Now, sir, let me ask you something else. Can you name one successful company that isn't cookie-based? Microsoft. Peter, I'll handle this. Uh, my husband and I would like to open a cookie store. We've done all the research, and I'm very confident we can turn a profit. I've brought some samples if you'd like to try one. She said one. Take one. Mmm. Well, these are delicious. Let me just run this by my supervisor. Yes! Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, this bank would like to help you start your business. Really?! Oh, that's fantastic! And if you have any other questions, you can call me at any time. Hello? How far away are the stars? Brian! Brian! Hold-hold on one second. I'll be right with you, Mr. Duckford. Brian! What? Let's order I was just thinking, let's order a kebab. A what? A kebab. But I but I want it in this order: vegetable, meat, meat, vegetable, meat. And, uh, Mr. Duckford would like some quackers. Can I leave now? No, no, Bri No, you can't. Brian, I need your help. I've made a series of small poops in my bath, and I need you to scoop them out with this fishnet. Yeah, I'm not doing that. You have to. You're my butler. I'm not your butler. I know, but wouldn't it be great if you were? It'd be I'd be so happy. In fact, the only thing that would make me happier is would is would be if this tub was filled with ""yawgurt."" Can you can you get me some yawgurt? Is the yawgurt shop still open? Is there is there some place to dial up yawgurt? Stop saying that. What's the best skin yawgurt? Who can who can prepare me a nice yawgurt treatment? If you say it like that one more time, I'm gonna drown you. Yawgurt. Uh, see? You're not you're not gonna do anything. Hey, hey, Brian, am I a good little guy? This space will be perfect, Peter. Yeah, it sure will, Lois. Now all we got to do is name the store. Ooh, ooh, I got it. Peter's Wife's Cookies. I love it. And I love you. Really? Yes. You know, we did so-so building a family, but this business-- I think we can really knock it out of the park. Oh, we sure can, Lois. We're gonna be a great team. Like Moses and his buddy who liked to collect seashells. Yay! I can't believe it, Peter. Our first day of business. All right. Well, we have got work to do, so let's roll up our sleeves and get right to it. There's a lot to do, so we can't be afraid to just roll up our sleeves and get the job done. We can't be hands-off managers. We got to roll up our sleeves and just dig in. Peter, your arms are turning purple. Purple with success. That's the color of money. You got to do the work of two men and pay yourself for one. Just roll up those sleeves and address the task at hand, whatever it may be, not shying away from the dirty work, but just rolling up our sleeves and having at it. Success is not given. It is taken. It's time to get in the game and get dirty. All right, I'm going to lunch. Uh, yes, I'd like a chocolate chip cookie. Elmer! What, Mom? You promised I could get a cookie if I finished all my surgery. Did you? Yeah. All of it? Um Get back there. I'm gonna do it. What does it matter when I do it? Lois, Lois, lock the door. Why? It's that lady who comes in, tries a sample, and then whispers about how bad she is. Hey. Oh, my God, you have chocolate macadamia nut? Oh, could I just try a little sample? Oh, I'm so bad. Uh, sure. You gonna buy a cookie this time? Oh, I better just stick with the sample. I'm so bad. But at least I know I'm bad, so that makes me a little less bad. Or worse. That was the right thing to do, Peter. Oh, boy, it's been really slow. I mean, if it doesn't pick up soon, we're not gonna stay in business very long. Don't you worry, Lois, you keep baking, I'll drum up some business. We just got to think outside the box, like the makers of Dreyer's ice cream. Guys, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: When people go to the supermarket, they need something to look at before they choose Haagen-Dazs. Hey, dude, can you pass me a speck of Spazz? Sorry, brah, all out. You want a cube of Froosh? Nah, I'm not into Froosh. I got a tear of Laser Dragon. Can I handle it? I don't know. Can you? Gum! What the hell is going on?! I don't know what to do, you guys. The cookie shop is tanking. If it fails, we're screwed. My God, what does it take to get people to buy a damn cookie? Peter, let me tell you something. I spend $600 a month on scented candles at the farmer's market just because there's a hot chick selling them. So what are you saying? You just bragging about candles? That's a weird thing to brag about. No, I'm saying sex sells. Trust me, you get a few hotties in that cookie shop of yours, I bet your sales will go up. Giggity. That was an unearned giggity, Quagmire. I said ""up."" No? No. No. Well, I'll try anything, Quagmire, 'cause I actually like running that cookie shop. It's way better than that job I had telemarketing to buttholes. Hello? Sorry, wrong number. Hello? Sorry, wrong number. And how are you today, sir? Oh, my God. Customers. What the hell? Peter, what did you do? I saved our business. And don't worry, I only hired women whose names are cookie-related. Lois, meet Cookie, Sugar, Spice, Cinnamon, Brown Sugar and Butter. Oh, hey, Butter. Some guys like Butter. Peter, you turned our store into a strip club. And I don't like what this place has become. You mean hugely profitable? We made all that today? Well, it was twice as much, but I had to bail out Cinnamon's kid. Thanks, Mr. Peter. This guy's the best. Well, I guess business is better than ever. That's the spirit, Lois. Just you watch, we'll be a bigger success than Richard Branson. Hey, where's the business guy in this boardroom? It couldn't be that tan, long-haired guy with the white linen pants, could it? It is! And now, to my amphibious sky submarine. I have way too much money! Come on, get-get down there, you old bag. There we go. Stewie, what are you doing? Being awesome. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. You're in no condition to drive. I'm fine to drive. I'm so fine. You s I can do all the tests. See? I can touch my nose. I can touch my  Head, shoulder, knees and toes, knees and toes.  Stop it. No, you stop it. You stop it, Brian. You're interfering with my professional business. Where's the radio? Oh, my God, are you okay? No. I don't feel so good. We should probably exchange numbers. Okay. I'm a ten, you're a four. This one's our new chocolate white chocolate, and for every dozen we sell, we donate 50 cents to Operation Smile. Yeah, nobody's listening to you. They're all watching Sugar write frosting swears on her jugs. She just wrote ""vagina"" on her boobs. That doesn't even make any sense. She's doing what? I told her ten minutes ago to put another batch of oatmeal in the oven. Oh, that dough is gone, Lois. I warmed it up and put it behind those waist-high holes in the wall. Is it spaghetti? A bowl of grapes? Ooh, this is the best haunted house ever. Peter, this is disgusting. I know we made a few changes, but this store should still be about selling cookies. Well, you're never gonna sell any looking like that. There. Now you're ready to sell cookies. You know what? That's it. I'm done. I don't know why I ever let you talk me into this this whatever this is now. It's a strip club that gives away free cookies. Ugh. Oh, crap. I should've known something was up when I saw all those cars out front. Stewie, why don't you come and have a seat with all your friends here? We have something to say to you. I'll go first. ""Stewie, I remember the day you were born. ""I thought to myself, here's a kid ""who's got a white, empty canvas stretched out in front of him."" Oh, please. What Who What is this What is this, the circle of perfect people? Who are you to judge me? Mis-Mister Mister Giraffe, who lets l-little boys grind on his rump. Mr. Octopus, who lets little boys grind on his rump. Every one of you has your own problems. Yeah, but you're the only one who almost killed a kid yesterday. Yeah, well, that's, d That's because that 'Cause, because that kid That's because because that 'ca because that kid that kid I know. Oh, Brian. Who am I? I don't have a cough, and my sinuses are remarkably wide open. But I have a problem. Good. Admitting it is the first step. But don't worry, I'll get you through it. Thank you, Brian. You're welcome, Stewie. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to Chris's room. We're doing a masturbation intervention. I got a bunch of his friends sitting in a circle in there Oh, dear God. Oh. Hey. Lois, before you say anything, there's something important I want to tell you. After you left, I ate cookie dough off the stomach of a 20-year-old, and then I vomited and all the girls laughed at me, and then it came out that they all think I'm fat and old. Is that it? I guess what I'm trying to say is I was wrong to choose sexiness over my wife. Peter, what are you doing? What-what was that? Oh, back at the store, I, uh, tucked my boner into the waistband of my pants and now it's sitting weird. That's your apology? Well, that and this. Oh, Peter, did did you bake this? Yeah. I love you, Lois. I really liked having a store with you, and I'm I'm sorry I messed it up. I was only trying to help. I know, Peter. So you want to split this with me? Uh, I wouldn't. Butter helped me with it, and she has chlamydia fingers. Well, it was fun having our own store. But from now on, my cookies are only for these customers. Oh, Mom. So, Mom, what are you gonna do with the shop? Well, I talked to the bank, and they agreed to take it back. Me love Cookie. Om, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Today's feature presentation of Glory will not be seen. What? Aw, I love that movie. Aw, man, that's gonna leave a big hole in their lineup. What's gonna fill the Glory hole? In place of Glory, we will be showing Shaft, starring Richard Roundtree. What? You can't just shove Shaft in the Glory hole. Yeah, I know. It'd be better to put in that movie about the two girls who meet Nixon. What's that movie called? Dick? Dick would slide right into that Glory hole. No, no, Dick's too short for that Glory hole. But if you also put in Edward Furlong's movie, Pecker, you got Pecker and Dick in the Glory hole, and you got a tight squeeze, but it-it ought to fit. The hell am I sitting on? Oh, hey, that's my old rope toy. I was wondering where that was. Ew, what would you want that for? It's gross. No, it's not. It's awesome. I can suck on it for the flavor. I can thrash it around, pretend it's a snake. Sometimes I just bite it like this. Rope! That's stupid. I want it. Well, you can't have it; it's mine. Oh, yeah? Not for long it ain't. Come on, Brian, I need this rope in case I open a nautical-themed restaurant. We got boat parts on the wall, so you know the crab comes from the ocean. Eating next to a porthole! What?! No, no, no, no, I don't want to make that trade. I thought I wanted to make that trade, but I don't want to make that trade. Hey, Chris. Where's your father? He's still trying to get that rope away from Brian. He's got to give up that obsession. I don't like what it's doing to him. Precious. Wants precious rope. Peter, enough with the rope. Also wants ice cream. No, Peter, it's too close to dinnertime. Get ice cream anyway. Don't you dare. All right, but I'll be back in a moment as another movie thing. I am Johnny Five. Need input. Input is ice cream. I need ice cream. Did I say I'm Johnny Five yet? You didn't go to work today, did you? So, still got that rope, I see. Well, I got a better rope. That's not a chewing rope. I know. It's a tying rope! Come on, Brian, you'd better let go. I told you this is mine! You're never gonna get it! Just give me the rope. Nobody has to get hurt, Brian. Only one person has to get hurt, Brian. My teeth! Oh! Oh, man! I'm real sorry about your mouth, Brian. Damn it, Peter. What were you thinking? This has to be the stupidest thing you've ever done. No, Brian. The stupidest thing I ever did was turn the bubbles off in a hot tub. Yeah! Party! Ew, bath with friends. Now, remember, Brian's probably very self-conscious about how he looks, so let's try to be supportive. Brian! Dinner! So, everybody, how was your day? What's for dinner? I'm starving. My God, you look like one of those animals. You know, the one that Which one does the sound? That Aw, crap, you know which one I mean. Oh, who am I kidding? You got to take me to the dentist to get my mouth fixed. Brian, we can try to make you feel a little less repulsive, but we're not spending human money on a deformed animal. What? Then what am I supposed to do? I don't know. But here, you can have this back. It's boring. It doesn't do anything. You know what? Go to hell, Peter! Wow, this is the craziest meal I've had since I had lunch at Tommy Sullivan's house. Very good macaroni and cheese, Mrs. Sullivan. Thank you, Chris. That was just awful, Chris. Terrible. He is not ready for flashbacks. No, he is not. Hey, listen, thanks for not laying into me like everybody else. I don't care enough about you to lay into you. But now that you mention it, your face looks like a used condom. Yeah, I know. Oh, come on, Brian. Don't do that. Don't cry. Be a man. I'm not crying! Look, listen, just here, just take this. What is this? That's my dentist. He'll bill me. I've got an account. You've got an account with a dentist? He sells me nitrous at wholesale, I bang his wife. Those both sound like things for you. Look, you want his number or not? I won't forget this, Glenn Quagmire. Don't ever say my name like that, okay? And don't tell anybody about this. Now get the hell out of the bar, you pathetic son of a bitch. Hey, language. My big fat black mom is here. I know I didn't just hear what that man said. Jerome, you got to go to extra church! Aw, Mom. We now return to My Dinner with Andre the Giant. I could never give up my electric blanket; it's cold in New York City. You may argue that this is a waste of energy, but to me, it's worth the comfort because, let's face it, the world is an abrasive place. I have maybe hours to live, and you're wasting them. Hey, I'm, uh I'm back from getting my new teeth. Well, come on in, Brian. Let's see them. All right, here it goes. Oh, my God! Look at your teeth! Hey, maybe you could help us build the dam. If you think you got the chops for it. Well, think about it. It's something to chew on. We use him just the right amount. So be honest, huh? You guys hate them. No, Brian, are you kidding? They're spectacular! You look like a movie star. Really? Yeah, you're like an even more handsome Adam Carolla. God, I can't believe you guys really like them. Yeah, Brian, you are gonna get so much sweet tail! Oo-cha, oo-cha, oo-cha, oo-cha! Brian, you have found your look. That is the best cosmetic surgery in this family since Lois got her boob job. I don't know what happened. I told the doctor C-cups. I told him something else. I think he did a dam good job. Okay, now we've used him too much.  When you're smiling   When you're smiling   The whole world smiles with you   When you're laughing   When you're laughing   The sun comes shining through   But when you're crying   You bring on the rain   So stop your sighing   Be happy again   Keep on smiling   'Cause when you're smiling   The whole world smiles with you.  Oh, good, you're already here. I'm sorry? Can we ask you a few questions? Uh yeah, sure. Is this a good neighborhood? Uh, yeah, it's a great neighborhood. Lot of families, good parks. Uh, six fire hydrants, but they are unavailable. They are previously claimed. They belong to some badass. Okay, but do you think this house will hold its value? I don't see why not. It's got a nice porch. And the yard's got plenty of room for little ones. Although that's really up to the two of you. Hey, so sorry I'm late. Let me show you the house. No need to. Your partner already sold us on it. Sorry, I-I didn't realize they thought I was a real estate agent. You are a real estate agent; you just don't know it yet. What do you mean? Look at that smile. You're a born salesman. You should come work for me. Huh. Never thought I'd be in real estate. You think I can handle it? Every other divorced mom at my kid's school is a realtor. I think you can handle it. Bonnie, I still don't get why you want to see this house. The foundation is totally out of whack. I mean, the-the whole house is slanting down to that cliff over there. Uh-huh. Can you open the sliding door? I'll take it. So tell me again, where's the lake? Right there. And where's the summer camp? Right over there. I'll take it. Now, I am obligated to disclose that the previous owners were murdered in this house. Whoa, buddy! Quit drilling; you already struck oil. I just don't know if this is the right time to buy. Yeah, you're probably right. Maybe we should wait till you graduate college. Thank you, but I'm actually 42 years old. Uh, that's not credible. Hello, Doctor? I need a new pair of eyes because clearly mine aren't seeing straight. You know what? Maybe I am ready to buy. Great! I'll get the paperwork. Hello? Hello? What's going on with your eyes? Oh, uh, nothing. Everything's fine. Is this the guy who wanted his pulse checked because he died and went to heaven? Uh, yes. Please stop calling. This is a very busy doctor's office.  Where you from   You sexy thing   Sexy thing, you.  Brian, five sales this week. You're killing it. Yeah. And last night, I closed another big deal. Kim in marketing. What are the specs? She's a two breast, one ass fixer-upper. The entire property was covered in a thick brush. Everyone in the office besides us is garbage. Wow, Brian, you're doing great here. You're really on fire. Thanks. I guess I should stop, drop, and roll. Whoa. That's enough. The only thing is, anyone can sell a nice house, but a real star is someone who can sell a dump. I can sell anything. Well, we got this crap condo down by the marina. We haven't been able to unload it in two years. You find some sucker to buy it, and I'll make you partner. All right, sounds good. It's a plan. Hey, did I tell you about Kim in marketing? You mean my wife Kim? I'm gonna go sell that condo. God, there's got to be a sucker to buy this condo. Guys, this is on me. I just hit 20 years in the air, and I got a big bonus. It's sad when planes 'splode. What? Yeah, I guess. Anyway, I am flush. For the first time in my life, I got money to burn. Looks like I found my sucker. Whoa. What? I didn't know you worked out at this gym, too. Hey, Brian. Hang on, I'm just finishing a set. Come on, come on, two more. Come on, come on, you got to want it. Nice job. Let's get you a rubdown. I'm glad I bumped into you because I've been meaning to give you something. What's this? That is the money you loaned me. Oh. That's pretty cool. Thanks. You're welcome. I just wish I could do something more for you. Hmm, I could make you rich. No, no, no, that's just money. I'll think of something else. What're you talking about, Brian? No, no, no, I've said too much. The one thing they're pretty firm about at the office is you don't take the inside deals and give them to your friends. What What kind of inside deal are you talking about? All I can say is underpriced waterfront property that's guaranteed to appreciate in value. That's all I can say. Oh, wait, a-are you bothered by sorority noise, though? I-I don't know, Brian. I don't know if I'm a real estate investor. Well, you might surprise yourself. I mean, I didn't think I'd ever be friends with Ice-T. What are you thinkin' about? Thinking about putting black guy hair in a ponytail. 'Cause the times change, but I don't. All right, guys, here it is. Prescott Towers. Quahog's premier luxury living experience. Nestled somewhere between the ocean and your imagination: Prescott Towers. Quahog's only luxury residence catering exclusively to the affluent. Affluent means rich. Come live in the kind of place a Persian guy would say is a little much. The ceiling is a pool. The ceiling is a pool. Quagmire, you got to get this. I don't know about buying a place without seeing it first. Of course not. I wouldn't expect you to. But as your friend, I wanted to let you know early because there's another buyer who's about to snap it up. I think he's a pilot for Delta. Delta? It's not Lew Sheridan, is it? Well, I'm not really permitted to say. Do you like Lew Sheridan? I hate Lew Sheridan. It's Lew Sheridan. That son of a bitch! Say what you want, but he's got an eye for real estate. Let me just give him a call and let him know he's gonna get the place. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay. I'll take it. All right. You won't be sorry. Yeah, that condo looks awesome. You're makin' a smart move, Quagmire. Like I did when I wanted to get out of that boring meeting. Third quarter projections indicate our sales will be down 40%. Why don't we go through the profit-loss statement line by line from the past six quarters, which will offer us a good cost analysis comparison that I think we'll be able to utilize as we move forward - Aah! into the next fiscal year. Hey, guys, I got to leave. I got a nosebleed, and, uh, I don't work here. All right, Quagmire, now when you introduce us to the ladies by the pool, I'm a millionaire, Joe's a war hero, and Cleveland is Magic Johnson. I own a lot of theaters. I hope you don't know much else about me. Is this the right address? This doesn't look like the building from Brian's presentation. Come on, Quagmire. Never judge a book by its cover. Or a movie. No. It's probably nothing, but there's a stain on the rug in the shape of a little kid. I don't know if you want this now, but I bought you a mini cactus. What the hell? This is a dump. Well, maybe it's still got a nice ocean view. The harbor is poisoned. Damn it. Brian screwed me. That's why I've never made any major investments with my dog. What am I gonna do? I sank my entire bonus into this place. Let me see your contract, Quagmire. There's got to be a way out of this. I'm gonna kill him, that's what I'm gonna do. ClubAmigos. That's what we're gonna call this place. Here it is. You've got to rescind the purchase. State law. Thank God. I got to go tell Brian the deal's off. Oh, there's a head in the freezer. Ooh, and sherbert. We're looking for Brian Griffin. I'm still within 72 hours, and I want to get out of my contract. You'd have to speak to Mr. Griffin about that. But I'm sorry, he's not in the office. Where the hell is he? Slow down, Quagmire. This sounds like a discussion to have over a cone-shaped cup of water. Ah. You can drink from these and then put 'em on your head to be a clown from an Italian opera.  Laughing outside, crying down below   Pasta, meatballs, Joe DiMaggio   Fellatio, Pinocchio, a pizza pie from Domino's   All of this because I'm singing in a pointy hat.  Look, Mr. Griffin's not here, but if you leave your name, I'll let him know you stopped by. Fine. Glenn Quagmire. Have him call me the minute he gets in. They're gone. Well, for the next 72 hours, I'm gonna be harder to find than a nice cat. You need me to clean out your litter box? Mittens. Okay, Rupert, we're going to play a game. I'm gonna be Buffalo Bill, and you're gonna be a great big fat person. Close the lid. Brian? What are you doing? I'm hiding from Quagmire for a few more hours. After that, he won't be able to pull out of that deal. Well, if anybody knows how to pull out, it's Quagmire. I have a lot of fun up here in my room. Welcome home. Aah! Hey-Hey, there, buddy. There you are. I've been looking all over for you. That's why you've been hiding from me in this motel? Now let me out of this deal and give me my money back. Look, i-if you're not happy with your current property, we could roll your money over into something in Sinkhole Estates. Those places are going very fast, though. Who's a pilot you hate? You are such a scumbag. You know, when you were poor, you were always a douche, but at least you came by it honestly. But now, screwing over the people who helped you? I don't know how you sleep at night. My God. You're right. I'm a jerk. I'm a selfish and pretentious jerk. And you're the only guy in town who's ever called me out on my crap. You know, I used to hate you for it, but now I think you're the only person who was trying to be my friend. No, I think you're misunderstanding me. No, I'm serious. Even though I know you never liked me, you still helped me when I really needed it. That says a lot about your character. I'm ashamed of myself. Because I am none of the things you are. You're honest, and direct, and compassionate, and that is 72 hours. Enjoy your craphole, dumbass. You son of a bitch! Wow, so I guess that's it for you and real estate, huh, Brian? Yeah, it was a lot tougher than I thought. Oh, yeah, it's real hard being a real estate agent. I mean, you got to be able to count bathrooms. I once beat a real estate agent in a game of chess. Me. A well-known buffoon. Face it, you failed at people's safety net job. Oh, come on, guys. Give me a break, huh? I've had a rough day. You've had a rough day? You guys wouldn't believe the day I've had. First of all, I didn't have any clean underwear this morning, so I had to wear a bathing suit. Then I missed the bus, of course. Then it looked like it was gonna start to rain. Luckily, it didn't. And like that wasn't enough, then we had a pop quiz in history. Oh, European history. American history was last year. Then"

And now we're so far from home, none of your stations even work.  She thinks I'm beautiful   Meet Virginia  Is this Is this fine? I mean, it's not it's Yeah, it's fine if you think it's fine. It's not that good of a song, but we know it. Yeah, okay. Sure.  She never compromises  Brian, I love Train. I  love Train. Chris, are Brian and your father back yet? No. And why are you saying the dog's name before Dad's? It's weird. That is weird, you're right. Well, they better get here soon. I can't host this Thanksgiving dinner on my own. Hear that? This thing's all on you. What? What are you talking about? Well, the fat man's never going to get back in time, and with him gone, that makes you the man of the house. I sentence you to death! Chris, Chris, slow down. I'm just saying, without Peter here, you're going to have to be the host of Thanksgiving. You have to do everything the fat man normally would. You mean, like, fall asleep on the toilet and have a big red ring on my bum for a week? No, no, no-- greeting guests as they arrive. Facilitating small talk. And, of course, giving the Thanksgiving toast. Boy, yesterday I'm microwaving a cat, today I'm giving a speech. Things move fast around here. Hi, do you have any turkeys? Sure do. You're looking at one. I'm sorry. You have to know me to know I'm just joking. Sir, the day we've had, we could use a good chuckle like that. You folks are in luck. Looks like we have one turkey left. Oh, thank God. Oh, you're telling me. We didn't come back with a turkey, Lois would be madder than that time she got a Capp smear. All right, we're just going to take a quick Capp smear. Don't you mean pap smear? No, at this hospital we obtain the sample using beloved British comic strip roustabout Andy Capp. 'Ello, luv. Let's have a smear. I'm not letting you do that. You can't even see. That's all right, bird. I goes by smell. Brian, look, an eight-foot basket. Let me just dunk the turkey once. I know I can jam it. That's not a regulation rim. Okay, you know what? I'm in charge of the turkey. You're driving. This thing on? Yes. It's not making any noise. It's a hybrid. Trust me, it's on. No, it's not. See? Oh, my God! Not now! Not like this! Peter, what the hell?! You chose a turkey over me?! I almost died! I swear to God, I thought dogs could breathe underwater. Great. The water completely killed my phone. Oh, horrors. You have to spend time with me without looking at your phone. Here, give me yours. I threw mine at a duck. Excuse me, can you help us? We're trying to get back to Quahog. If you want, I can take you as far as the bus station. You can? Oh, thank you so much! Oh, that is the nicest thing anyone's done for me since my kids gave me that Father's Day gift. Oh, look, a tie. Perfect. It's from all of us! All right, Chris, acting as host will demand a higher level of conversation. I suggest as your opener-- ""Lois, everything is delicious."" Then that's what I will say. Unless Slender Man commands me to say something else. Ugh, this is gonna be a bigger disaster than Y2-Gay. Three! Two! One! I hope my dad's not watching ABC! Oh, thank God we got on this bus. I really had to poop. Wait, where is there a bathroom on this bus? I didn't say there was a bathroom, I just said I had to poop. Oh, my God! This is gross even for a bus! I don't know what they were so mad about, I did it in a Rite Aid bag. Damn it, Peter! That was our only way home! Well, that's where you're wrong, Brian. Free bus bike! Aw, crap, this is a girl's bike. All right, we'll ride it, but pray to God nobody from school sees us. Nice bike, butt-munch! Shut up! I'm telling Miss Baumbakis! Up next on Nickelodeon, Uncomfortably Hot Eighteen-Year-Old Girls. Honey, where are you off to? To the car wash to raise money for our new soccer uniforms. Okay, have fun. Nickelodeon-- casually ask your daughter what that girl's name is, then take your laptop into the bathroom. Uh, Mom! Daddy! You're right on time! Happy Thanksgiving, dear! We brought some wine, but it's good wine so it's just or us. Damn it. Where the hell are they with that turkey? Hi, you've reached Brian Griffin of The Write Stuff writing classes Oh, God. Come on, keep pedaling. Dinner starts in an hour. Oh! Ow! Damn it, Peter! Oh, great. You broke the chain and now we have to walk! Unless we hitchhike. Hitchhike? You know how dangerous that is? Besides, we're in the middle of nowhere. There aren't even any cars around. There's one. Hey! Hey, stop! Give us a ride! It's just me and my upright dog. We're obviously not weirdoes! See, Brian? Told ya. We're going to be home in no time. Hi there, folks. Hand over the turkey. What?! I can't go back to my wife without a turkey! Oh, yeah? Bet that thing's not even loaded. You just used your last bullet. Running on empty now. Brian, give him the turkey. Okay, buddy, you ready to test out those hosting skills? Now go wow your guests with conversation. Hi, Grandma. I got some down-there hair now-- want to see? Uh, I-I I should check if your mother needs help in the kitchen. Sometimes I pluck them because I deserve pain. Cut! No. Stop. I'm sorry! I panicked! It's all right. It's okay. Don't worry, Chris. You can't always get things right on the first try. Just look at Snoopy's original happy dance. Hey, you having a good time tonight? Oh, yeah. Can't believe we got robbed. Yeah, but can we just talk for a second about how brave I was when we walked past that cemetery? Peter, do you not see that we are completely screwed here? And it's all thanks to you! You drove my car into a lake, you almost let me drown, you got us thrown off a bus, you broke our bike, and now you've gotten our turkey stolen and Thanksgiving is ruined and we don't have any transportation and we're still miles from home! You're starting to get black gums like an older dog. You know what? You know what? Maybe it's my fault. I forgot, I'm talking to a complete idiot. You are so stupid! Oh, yeah? Well, if I'm so stupid, then how did I manage to frame you for eating the turkey? What?! Yeah! Didn't you notice you were passed out in all those photos? You didn't eat any of it. I just posed you like that because I didn't want to take all the blame. You son of a bitch! How could you do that to me? You're a dog, Brian. I can throw you off a bridge, and as long as I don't hit a person on a boat, it's okay. Screw this. I am done! This isn't even my problem, it's your problem. You know what, Peter? You've got no turkey, and now you've got no friend. Good-bye! W-Wait-- Brian, wait!  Now let's watch a whole bunch of ads.  Nice Thanksgiving. I don't know why I ever listen to that jerk. What? Home is this way; we're both just walking home. Leave me alone! No way. We're a team, Brian, whether you like it or not. Just like almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves. Who's hungry? We are! Hey, kids, would you like a terrible healthy sandwich? No. Too bad, because your recently divorced mom has a crush on her trainer, and he eats like this, so now you have to, too. Almond butter and no sugar added fruit preserves-- just like PB and J, but with more of your mom railing this guy. I named myself Kaya! We stopped being a team when you framed me for eating that turkey with you. Brian, maybe you should be a little less mad at me and a little more mad at the guys growing mustaches for this month. Hey, don't mock Mo-vember. Last year, I raised eight dollars and got on a BuzzFeed listicle. No! You use real words! Internet stuff is not real words. Hey, look! There's our answer. We break into the zoo, steal a turkey, bring it home, we're heroes. Peter, stop it! You're gonna get yourself hurt. Sorry, can't hear you. Too busy saving our family's Thanksgiving. Damn it. This is idiotic. You're never gonna find a turkey in there. Oh, I'll find one. I mean, you're looking at the guy who found the Fountain of Youth. It's very far away from here! Hey, Lois, thanks for letting Kevin bring his girlfriend this year. And I hope it's not awkward that she's a little person and they viciously fight all the time. Why do we have to spend every holiday with your family? Shut up! I'm a full-size person! I make the decisions! Don't you worry. This'll quickly turn into rough, front-yard, makeup sex. All this fighting is making me so damn hot. Oh, my God. It looks like he's chalking a pool cue. Hey, scoot over. As the oldest guy here, it's my duty to take an open mouth nap in the middle of the room. God, look at my mom. Dinner should've been served half an hour ago. She's clearly stalling for time. Okay, everybody. Dinner's gonna be ready very soon. Uh, what? Um, oh, good. But before we get started, I thought we could all take turns telling a long story about how things aren't the way they used to be. Daddy, would you care to start? You bet I would. Too much candy! Too much candy? What do you mean, too much candy? There's too much candy! There used to be four candies. Bulls-eyes, Yahoos, Sweet Yarn and cigarettes. Now I go into a store, I don't know whether I'm coming or going! Is there anything else? Why don't ballplayers wear giant woolen shirts anymore? What's wrong with wool? It was a perfect fabric. You go to the ballpark, get your bag of Bulls-eyes and watch Hack Wilson round the bases in a big wool shirt. I once saw Hack hit a ball out of the infield. I still remember the thud of the bat and the whoosh of the wool. I wish things were still heavy. Oh, the rails are off this thing. All right, Chris, this is where you, as host, need to step in and Chris? Chris? What the hell? Are you drunk? I couldn't handle the pressure, Stewie. We Irish, we have a deep sadness. Oh, come on, get up! They need you down there.  Too-Ra-loo-Ra-loo-ral.  All right, there they are. I'm going in and getting us a turkey, Brian. Hey, buddy, you want to come to my house so my wife can cook you wrong? Ah, damn it! Peter, this is never gonna work. All right, just leave the turkey alone. The poor thing is Aah! Aah! What the hell?! Knock it off! Ow! Damn it, I'm gonna kill you, you dick! Quick, Brian, it's getting away! Where'd he go? He's not in here. Over there! Oh, crap. Easy there. Hey, it's Thanksgiving. Shouldn't you be in Detroit losing a football game right now? Brian, up here! Oh, my God. Thank you, Peter. Thank you so much! Hey, you're welcome, buddy. You You saved my life. Of course I did. You're my best friend. Hey, listen, I'm-I'm I'm sorry I messed everything up today. It's okay. I guess I've been kind of a jerk, too. I'm sorry I yelled at you. Ah, I deserved it. I mean, for God's sake, I sank your car in a lake. And I broke this guy's neck just now. Yeesh. But, hey, we cut the legs off him and dye him brown, we got ourselves a turkey, right? No. We've come this far. Let's do it right. Hey, you got a tiny head and a big body. What if I switched that? Gotcha! All right, we did it! We got ourselves a turkey. Yeah, but what time is it? I mean, dinner has to have started by now. We're never gonna make it home on foot. Maybe we don't have to. We're now arriving in Quahog. Up on the right are the people with the awesome trampoline, but they don't let me on it no more, 'cause I bounced a kid onto the house. There were no squeezable condiments. Ketchup came in a can. And, Daddy, what about the pants that kids today are wearing? Are they properly sized? Are we gonna eat soon? I have an interesting factoid about what makes you sleepy afterwards. Yeah, the hell with this. I'm starving. Okay, I guess we should eat. Well, obviously Peter's not here. So it's fallen to me to take up the mantle. Now, I wasn't planning on doing this today, but when I look around at all of these open, loving faces or friends and family, I am comfortable enough to finally say that I am a proud, unashamed, active Lois, we're home and Thanksgiving is saved! Kidding! Oh, my God, where the hell have you been? And what are you doing with a live turkey?! A live turkey who loves Rollerblading. Our dog drew that. Peter, we can't eat a live turkey. Look, Lois, I still got time to make this right. And I'm gonna. Hand me a nine iron and show me to the backyard. Well, buddy, I guess this is it. Aah! Aah! Wow, I-I I read that look wrong. Ah, geez, I'm sorry. I wish you didn't have to die, but a bunch of white people put on sweaters. I couldn't do it. What? I'm sorry, Lois. I know you wanted the perfect Thanksgiving, and I know I screwed that all up for you, but when you think about it, isn't this holiday about being with people you love? I mean, does it really matter what we eat? What matters is we're all together. Family and friends. And one new friend. Oh, Peter, that's beautiful. Lois, can the turkey please join us for dinner? Not as the meal, but as our guest? Of course he can. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. The man of the house killed a turkey for Thanksgiving! Well, looks like we're having turkey after all. Four years later, me and Lois divorced and Stewie died. Gobble, gobble!"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Oh, I love shopping at Christmastime. Ugh, mall food courts are so depressing. You can always tell which fathers are disappointed in their sons because they eat lunch with their coats still on. How's that food, dum-dum? Too bad eating ain't math, 'cause then I'd have something to be proud of. I want to go live with Mom. I know. So do I. Welcome to Tommy Bahama. Yeah, you got anything for a poor fat person who wants to look like a rich fat person? Of course. Now, I'll mostly be hitting on waitresses who are too young and thin to ever be interested in me. Hitting on them in a kindly, genial way? No, in a threatening, creepy, I'm-joking-but-I'm-not- really-joking way. Y-You have anything for that? Sir, what you're describing is precisely Mr. Bahama's vision.  Tommy Bahama-- five million uncles can't be wrong. Hey, sorry to bother you, but would you like to work here? Me? Yeah, you'd be perfect. All right, now let me just take off these security tags for you. It's a living. So random! That's a comment on us. Hey, check that out. Oh, wow. This is awesome! You know Jeff Garlin has one of these in his house. Ah, I love this chair. Dog in a Jets jersey, get in here! God, I have the best basement. Peter, this chair costs $3,000. That's not so much, Lois. It's only infinity times what you bring home every week. Peter, look over there. Is that is that Jesus? Whoa, yeah, wow. It's been a while since we've seen him. Hey, Jesus! Oh, hey, guys. Hey, buddy. What are you doing in Quahog? Actually, I never left. Really? Why didn't you call us? Well, I felt kind of bad about how we left things. I wasn't sure you'd want to hear from me. Oh, that's silly. We could never stay mad at you. Yeah, I've never been one to hold grudges. I even forgave the man who murdered my son. And although I will never get over the pain of what you did to my son, I forgive you, because I believe you are sick and in need of help. Mr. Griffin, this is the Office of City Planning. You requested a variance to build a hot tub off your garage. Oh, yeah. Did I get it? No. I will kill your son! Your son is dead! I'm so glad there's no hard feelings. Listen, Peter, we should catch up. Why don't you come over to my place for a beer or something? Aw, that sounds great! Hey, you want me to pick anything up on the way over or no, you're good? Oh, uh I-I guess we could maybe just order something. Yeah, I don't have any cash, but we'll figure it out. Hey, Peter. Come on in. Mi casa es, uh I-I don't know Spanish. Huh, I think half the world would be surprised to know that. Hey, nice place here. This is not too too it's not it's not too not too good. Yeah, I know it's nothing fancy, but, you know, I'm not really into material possessions. Geez, this place is depressing. Hey, how come you aren't with your family during Christmas, anyway? I can't deal with my family during the holidays. And besides, my dad always spends Christmas at his time-share in Coral Gables with his girlfriend. Great, here comes that couple with the adult disabled kid. Hey, can we join you? I-I'm Ken, this is Pam, and this right here is Scott. We really want to thank you, God, for testing us. It's been such a blessing. Can't wait to see what that ""bigger plan"" is. Well, I can't tell you that. But the good news is, this little guy's gonna make it to 74. Oh, look, Jesus, you shouldn't be alone during Christmas. And if I remember correctly, isn't your birthday sometime soon, too? Ah, whatever, I'm fine. I'll probably just reheat some ramen and watch Grey's Anatomy. No way. I'm not gonna let my pal Jesus spend his birthday like that. Hey, you know what? I am throwing you the best birthday party ever. Are you sure about that? Yeah, I'm great at throwing parties. I was in charge of planning Woodstock. All right, guys, here's what I'm thinking-- a whole festival of muddy boobs. Well, don't you want to have music? Oh, yeah. That's a good way to get those muddy boobs moving. All right, you guys, Jesus's birthday party is gonna be epic. Hey, since it's also Christmas, maybe we could make it, like, a Christmas theme. What about Secret Santa? That's always fun. Okay, but five dollar limit. Why don't we just say no gifts? Come on, guys, we don't have to make such a big thing about it. It's not like I'm a woman who's about to turn 30. You guys, I don't care what we do for my birthday, as long as it lasts the whole week and is very expensive and inconvenient for all my friends. Oh, and I'm gonna dress like a slut and be rude to everyone for no reason. But, Maya I don't care that your dad's dying, we're all going to Montreal for the week. Wait, wait, hold on. If we're planning a party, we haven't even talked about the most important thing. A hydration plan for people who overheat? It could be as simple as an ice bath. No, no, I'm talking about women. Oh, yeah, we definitely need some women there. Jesus, what kind of girls do you like? Women? Uh, all types, I guess. ""All types""? Come on, Jesus. Even Martin Lawrence when he used to dress up like Shenehneh? Shenehneh! No, you know what I mean. Uh, like, uh, hot ladies. Horny ones who sex on you. What? Yeah, you know. They come back to your house and sit on your butt. Wait a minute. Jesus, have you ever been with a woman? Are you are you a virgin? Yeah, I am. How the hell does that happen? Well, in high school, my best friend was this hot prostitute, and I just kind of got into the friend zone. She's all like, ""Oh, there's all these guys having sex with me for money."" And I'm all like, ""Oh, you deserve better."" And then I die. Well, sex is overrated. Stay out of this, Joe. All right, look, forget the party. We got a more important mission now. Your 2,000-year-long cold streak is about to come to an end. What do you mean? I'm saying, Jesus, we are gonna help you lose your virginity. God, I love sex! All right, me and the guys are off to help Jesus lose his virginity. Just put it in the oven for half an hour at 350. What? I don't know. That's what you always say when you leave the house. Oh, Peter, just be careful. Losing your virginity is a big deal. I'm sure Jesus doesn't want some gross quickie. No, no, no, it's gonna be nothing like that. Just some random slut to maul in a bar back where the payphones used to be. Peter, that's what I'm talking about. You're making this whole thing crude. It's his first time. You need to be more sensitive. Don't worry, Lois. I swear, I'll be sensitive and gentle. Like the Tasmanian Devil tucking in his kids. All right, Jesus, these speed date nights are the best way to meet a lot of chicks fast. Now go get 'em. So, where do you live? Everywhere, all places. Hopefully, inside you. This is kind of embarrassing, but are you okay with someone who smokes? Oh, yeah. A-Are you okay with someone who wanders the desert, lecturing people on how to act? So, are you having a good Friday? Oh, is that supposed to be funny? Shut your mouth, bitch. How's the wine? It's terrific. That's my blood, you know. Where are you from? Israel. All right, Jesus, nowadays, everything is done on the Internet. All right? So, we got to get you on Facebook. Uhp, let me just close a couple of these windows. There we go. Sorry, I was up late last night. Had the house to myself. Sorry. Sorry. Lot of POV stuff. Yeah, I like to pretend it's mine down there what's doing all the slapping. Peter, how old is that girl? Excuse me, won't you? Ar lot of scumbags out today. Well, no luck getting Jesus laid yet. I don't get it. Jewish guys are supposed to be swimming in tail. Peter, Jesus is never gonna find a woman going about it your way. I think it's time I had a little talk with him so he knows what a woman really wants. All right, knock yourself out. Don't look! Don't look! Don't look! Jesus, I asked you to lunch because I think you've been getting bad advice about finding a special someone. Well, Peter's been doing his best, but lately he seems more focused on marketing his erotic Advent calendar. All right, kids, let's see what's under Christmas Ugh, another puckered anus. Look, Jesus, just forget whatever Peter's been telling you. You just have to be yourself and let a sweet girl see that side of you. Well, you're easy to talk to. I just get all tongue-tied with other girls. Plus, being myself isn't that impressive. What do you mean? You're sensitive, you died for our sins and ascended into Heaven, and you got nice skin. Don't be afraid to be honest with a girl and show her who you are. Wow, thanks, Lois. That's the second best advice anyone's ever given me. I don't know, man. Jesus Hitler Christ sounds weird. So just go with ""H""? Yeah. All right, guys, let's not get discouraged, okay? We just got to be more creative about getting Jesus laid. I just tell folks to go down to the Happy Handy Smile Massage and get it over with. I sometimes go down there, and when they tell me I'm done, I leave. Hey, guys. Uh, Peter, can I talk to you for a sec? Sure. Peter, listen. I've found the woman who I'd like to lose my virginity to. It's someone who understands me and someone I feel very close to. Oh, wow. Jesus, that's great! Hey, is it Carrie Underwood? Somebody told me you guys went out once. Yeah, we did. But it was a disaster. Jesus, take the wheel. What? I want to kill these  cops! Actually, Peter, I want my first time to be with Lois. Lois, my partner at the law firm? No, Peter. It's your Lois. Lois Griffin. What?! I am outraged! But probably not as outraged as the ten million Christians watching. Please write to this address quickly. Maybe we can both stop these Hollywood Jew writers from wrecking my marriage and your religion. You want to lose your virginity to Lois?! No way! Look, Peter, I know it's a lot to ask. But if it wasn't okay, I wouldn't suggest it. Well, you make a good point. But this is my wife you're talking about! Please, Peter? I just know Lois would make my first experience as special and memorable as it should be. Plus, I can make it worth your while. After all, I'm Jesus. I could give you anything you want. Anything? Like like anything in the universe? Absolutely. Brookstone massage chair. Really? Are-are you sure? Yup. Never been more sure of anything in my life. Well, except one thing. Good evening, sir. Would you like to hear our specials? No! Pizza! Let me get this straight. You want me to have sex with another man? Oh, not just any man, Lois. This is Jesus we're talking about. He's a savior. He could even save our marriage. Why? What's wrong with our marriage? ""What's wrong with our marriage?"" You're sitting around, talking about sleeping with other guys! Peter, this was your idea! Lois, let's not play the blame game. Clearly, there's been a lot of cheating on both sides, but the point is where do we go from here? Huh, I don't know. Sleeping with Jesus just feels wrong. Doesn't the Bible say not to covet thy neighbor's wife? Oh, come on, Lois, the Bible's just a bunch of general guidelines. None of the commandments are written in stone. You're really okay with this? Of course. Look, there really is no downside to this. It's one of those things that seems bad, but really is good. Like that fracking company we let drill in the backyard. Well, I guess it is kind of an honor that out of all the people in the world, Jesus chose me. I mean, he could've had anyone. Elizabeth Perkins, Patricia Richardson, Katey Sagal Yeah! I-I mean, maybe not them, but somebody else. And-and the Son of God's first time should be special. Even divine. Maybe I'd actually be doing a good thing. You sure about this, Peter? You bet. As sure as I was when I created Lady Gaga. All right, listen, fella, your game is confusion. Zip! Zam! Zoop! Nobody gets a straight look at nothing! Boy, this must be killing you. You're an atheist, and the one guy you don't believe in is getting to bang the woman of your dreams. You know what? I don't have to sit here and take this. I'm out of here. Can-can you let me outside? Hi, Peter. Well, hello, young man. Don't you look nice? She's almost ready.  There she goes   There she goes again   Pulsing through my veins   And I just can't contain  I'm sorry, I was just coming down the stairs at the same time. Wow, Mom. You look beautiful. Well, we know he's circumcised, so she won't have to deal with that nonsense. Oh, and don't worry about not hittinbottom. I've only grazed it once and that was with a running start. Hey, Jerome, give me another Pawtucket Pat. I'll take it over here on my Brookstone massage chair. That's a nice chair, Peter. Hey, do you think if I let Jesus sleep with Bonnie, he'd give me back the use of my legs? Joe, I don't speak for Jesus. I just get him trim. Now to take this thing out for a spin. Ah, time for a relaxing, sponsored daydream. Oh, Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! God, I love massage chairs. Are you in one, too? Yes, but it's horrible! It was bought for me by Jesus, but now he's doing my wife! Oh. I'm just trying mine out in the store. Guys! I think I might've made a terrible mistake with this whole Lois and Jesus thing! I don't blame you, Peter. I always thought it was sort of a strange choice to let Jesus have relations with your wife. I'm sorry, did you say Jesus is sleeping with your wife? Great, now everybody knows my wife is taking Jesus's virginity. Listen, pal, Jesus ain't no virgin. He did the same thing to me last Christmas. He what?! Yeah, Jesus did the same thing to my wife Christmas before last and my buddy's wife the year before that. What the hell? But he's so lonely. Nah, he just acts lonely and lies about being a virgin so he can get with guys' wives. Did he show you that sad little apartment? He doesn't really live there. He just uses it to store art he bought on cruises. Oh, my God, what have I done?! Peter, maybe there's still time! Maybe you can stop them! Where are they? They're at the Barrington Hotel! Let's go, guys! I just ordered nachos, but good luck, Peter. Now for a slippy, no-boots run through the snow to my car. Aw, crap! I just pulled a thousand muscles! Ow! That was a loud crack! Ah, yeah, that was all bone! Oh! Aw! Son of a whore! Oh, this is bad. This is real bad. I'm not gonna go to the doctor though. Damn it! Get out! I need this car! What are you, a cop? No! Jesus is about to have sex with my wife! Oh, then here! Take it! Get out! I need this car! So do I! Jesus Christ is about to have sex with my wife! Lenny Kravitz is about to have sex with my daughter! Oh! Oh, my God! Here, take the car! Take the car! Get out of here! What are you doing?! Go, go, go! Hey, kid, I need that toboggan! Jesus Christ is gonna have sex with my wife! Um, okay. And I need your little hat. And those Spider-Man mittens-- I'll need those, too. And what's in your pockets? A rabbit's foot, a penknife, a bottle cap, a compass All of it, all of it. Aw, crap. I'm out of hill. You there! Boy! What does that sign say? I ain't much for book reading, sir. But I seen our Lord and Savior bring a lady in there for a Christmas rodgering, I did. You're a good boy. Here's a goose. What room is Jesus in? What room is Lenny Kravitz in? Aw, you were coming here, too? We could've carpooled. Lois! Lois! You son of a bitch! What have you done to my marriage?! Peter? Lois, don't do this! I think I had, like, a Christmas miracle. I realized I don't want other people humping my wife for a chair. It's okay, Peter. Nothing happened. It didn't? No, I couldn't sleep with him. Not that I wasn't tempted. He put actual strawberries in a glass of champagne, which was about the classiest, sexiest thing I'd ever seen. But I couldn't go through with it. Our marriage is too important to me. I love you, Lois. I don't know what I was thinking. But you! You're a liar, Jesus! Bravo, Peter, Lois. Seems like you folks learned the lesson I intended. What lesson? Oh, you know, uh that, uh, this holiest of days is about, uh, appreciating our loved ones and, uh, resisting temptation. Oh, so it was a test. Like when your father told Abraham to sacrifice Isaac? Yes! That! That's exactly right! Uh, well, I can see my work here is done. Well taught, Jesus. Well taught. Yeah, I guess. Who cares? I'm not even real. Merry Christmas. Well, Lois, I'm sure glad you didn't have sex with the Messiah. Me, too, Peter. Now let's open your presents, kids. Oh, Rupert, you're such a sneak. I wonder what it is. Oh. A Joni Mitchell CD. ""To continue your emotional education."" That's great. That's really great. Could you excuse me for just one moment?  I've looked at clouds from both sides now  Who did he buy the necklace for? I'm gonna let that teddy bear go all the way."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  You are watching Amazon Prime, the network that brought you your sunscreen in two days. Amazon Prime-- like the eighth best way to watch TV. Hi, Chris, how was school? Wait, what's that note pinned to your backpack? Bet it's from a girl in the lunchroom who wants a taste of corn dog. Was that a sex joke? It's I don't know, shut up. Oh, dear, it's from Principal Shepherd. Peter, he wants to see us first thing tomorrow. Oh, Chris is in trouble. Sounds like he needs a little fatherly wisdom. Better get my pipe. Peter, I think that's the wrong kind of pipe. I'm sorry, Mom. I haven't been doing too great in school lately. Well, that's very disappointing. I guess your father and I will have to talk to the principal and figure out how to handle this. Ah, I wouldn't worry, Lois. I never did very well in school either. I even failed homeroom. Peter Griffin? There. Thank you for coming, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin. Chris seems to be struggling in his classes, and often when kids have trouble in school, it's because something is going on at home. I haven't been attracted to Lois for a year and a half. Principal Shepherd, exactly how poorly is Chris doing? Well, right now, he has a D-minus average. His only hope is his history final tomorrow. If he fails that, I'm afraid he'll have to repeat ninth grade. This seems more like a phone call. Oh, my God. I-I always knew Chris wasn't a great student, but I had no idea the situation was so dire. Don't worry, I'll make sure Chris passes history. You can count on me. The same way NASA counted on me during the Apollo 13 crisis. All right, I'm gonna need three coffins-- mahogany with brass handles-- three new daddies for the dead astronauts' kids, and a black suit for me. Sir, I think I know a way we can get them back. Is it hard? It might be. Yeah, we-we've kind of already decided we're going in this direction. All right, Chris, you got a lot riding on this history exam tomorrow. I know. Sam Cooke didn't know much about history, and he got shot in a hotel wearing nothing but a sports coat and a shoe. Yeah, that's hilarious, Chris, but we've got to buckle down. Now, I'm gonna help you study by nailing your door shut. That way, you'll have no choice but to hit the books. Oh, crap, I left my phone in there. Damn it, it's nailed shut. Dad, it looks like some girl sent you a picture of her privates. Oh, crap! Lois! I don't have the phone! Stop sending pictures! I already sent four more! Chris, put down the phone! Don't look at those! Wait a minute, that's both her hands! Who the hell is taking the pictures?! All right, give me that phone and get back to work. And before you judge your mother-- you did most of that damage. Oh. Hey, Chris. Just wanted to see how the studying's going. You guys, I've been at this all night, and I haven't learned a thing. There's no way I'm gonna pass Mr. Harpington's history test. Oh, come on, Chris. I'm sure that's just the nerves talking. Here, I'll quiz you. Who said, ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself""? Scooby-Doo? No. Shaggy? It's nobody on Scooby-Doo. Wow, Chris, you, uh you really don't know history. And if I fail ninth grade, I won't amount to anything. I'll end up being one of those bus drivers that parents don't completely trust. You have a beautiful child, Mrs. Roberts. God, poor Chris. He's studying as hard as he can, but it doesn't seem to matter. Well, we got to do something. If he doesn't pass this test, he's gonna have to Hey. he's gonna have to repeat ninth grade. Well, there's not much we can do about it. Some people just aren't able to learn from books. Well, maybe he doesn't have to. What do you mean? Maybe there's a way to actually show Chris history with my time machine. You know, that's really nice of you, Stewie. Well, he's my brother. We've got to stick together. Like that two-headed girl on TLC. Okay, who wants to taste it, and who wants to smell it? All right, we'll just tell Chris he's dreaming, because I don't want him to know about my time machine. Why not? Eh, it's like having a pickup truck. Once people know you got one, there go your weekends. Chris? Can you hear me? Huh? You're dreaming. I'm dreaming? Yay! No consequences! So lifelike! All right, let's go back six minutes and try this again. Chris, you're dreaming with consequences. What? That's right. We're gonna take you on a special dream trip to help you pass your history test. You are? Yes, and there's so much to learn. For example, did you know that Jesus didn't really die on the cross? So, what was the cause of death? Cocaine and severe trauma to the colon. Yeah, I'm gonna need to see those forms. Don't look at me like that. Babe, I told you, it's a business trip. All right, I've got the return pad, and the time machine is powering up right now. We should be leaving any moment. This thing is awesome. Stewie, can you believe Brian built this? Wait, what? Oh, hey, come on, guys. ""Who built what"" is not a question on the history final, right? Good point, Brian. That's why victory is always Brian's. You dick! How much of my stuff have you taken credit for?! Hey, everybody? Just so you know, I'm straight. All right, Chris, I reviewed your textbook, and I've programmed a tour of the various historical events that you'll need to know for your exam. So, pay close attention. First stop-- Washington, D.C. The year is 1803. Ah, the future. Now, the man at the podium is Thomas Jefferson. And this is a very important moment. He's trying to convince Congress to approve the Louisiana Purchase. Come on, guys! We're getting Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota and Louisiana. What are the chances all those states suck? This is Paris, 1920. This bar is where famous American writers, like Ernest Hemingway, would go for a drink. Oh, my God, there he is! Excuse me, Mr. Hemingway, can I have a beer with you? Sure! I love life and all the people in it! Thanks. And, hey, as a fellow writer, I would love to talk to you about the craft. I mean, God, if only we could get rid of these damn arms and attach the pen directly to the heart, right? You guys, I got his pen! Now, Chris, this is Brazil before the invention of the soccer ball. Australia before the shark-tooth necklace. And Italy before pasta. Ay! Oh! Vowel sound! They were always a ridiculous people. Hey, Family Guy, you're lucky I got a manicotti in the oven, or I'd bash your face into a bolognese. That's two kinds of food. That's how angry I am. Oh, my God! Where are we?! Omaha Beach, 1944. This is D-Day. What's that over there? Oh, that's Double D-Day.  She's my cherry pie   Cool drink of water, such a sweet surprise   Tastes so good  Nein, nein! No fire! Ist gut! Heil hooters! Be careful. It could be a booby trap! Oh, Otto. Here we are. Christmas night, 1776. The father of our nation, George Washington, is about to boldly cross the Delaware. What's on his arms? Those are water wings. He was terrified of the water. Easy! All right, Chris, it's 1798, and we're in the home of Jane Austen. Jane Austen? I don't think she's on my history test, Stewie. Oh, I know-- we're just here to release pent-up time-travel farts. Awesome! Yeah! Aw, yeah! Give me some of that! Mmm, the insides of men! This is what fuels me! Mmm! Okay, time for some recent history. This is the 1990s.  And I'll tell myself I'm over you  This is the entire 1990s? Yes. Wait a minute. Pre-Soviet Russia? This wasn't on the manifest. Yeah, this is kind of a personal thing. Hey, Pavlov, you dog-teasing-dick! How's this for positive reinforcement?! All right, where to next? I want to kill more scientists! All right, Chris, that was the British Parliament, 1912. Next, we I say, that looks like a young Charlie Chaplin. Sir, please, take this money and use it to pursue your dreams. Danke. Stewie, I think that was a young Hitler. You just gave money to Hitler! Yeah, but before all the crazy stuff. All right, Chris, let's discuss what you've learned so far. Now, what is your biggest takeaway from our travels? That you can't take a good nap with keys in your pocket. For God's sake, Chris! You clearly have not paid attention to anything we've shown you! You're absolutely hopeless! Did you ever consider-- the reason you're having trouble passing ninth grade is that you're incapable of anything else?! That this is the absolute zenith of your ability?! Zenith means top. No, it means TV. Ha! Now I'm catching fire. Damn it, Chris, your problem isn't book learning, it's that you're a moron! This whole trip has been a complete waste of time! Screw you, Stewie. You're a jerk! And I'm gonna win that bowling tournament, with or without you! What is he what? He-he doesn't even know what we're preparing him for! Chris? Chris, come back! Well, we've looked all over London. He's nowhere. I don't know what the hell we're going to do. Hey, Stewie! If I'm such a moron, then how did I get on a fancy boat?! See you later, douche bags! Oh, crap! Chris is on the Titanic?! No, no, it's okay, Brian. We'll just go back in time to before Chris ran off. Oh, and I took your fancy smoke detector! My God, he's got the return pad! Brian, we've got to get on that ship! Attention, passengers. The karaoke contest will begin in five minutes. Okay, now we've really got to get on that ship. Brian, we have to get on that ship! It's our only hope to save Chris. There! Jump onto that mooring rope. We can use it to pull ourselves up. Oh, thank God, I wasn't sure we were gonna make it. I wasn't worried. I've faced bigger challenges. Like trying to dress Jonah Hill for the Oscars. Okay, okay, perfect. Tell him to stay exactly that weight. Yes? Damn it! Oh, my God, Brian. This ship, it's it's unbelievable. It's even more magnificent than I imagined. That, Brian. That. That's what I was telling you about. That's brocade. Come on, Stewie, we got to find Chris and the return pad before it's too late. All right, let's split up. I'll go search in first class, you go down to steerage and wade through the gross Irish and Italians. That's two. Ugh, God knows what I'm gonna find in steerage. Bunch of drunk, fat, pie-faced Irish fools. Excuse me, have any of you seen a blond teenage boy? Who's asking? Yeah, who the hell are you? And I'm the baby! Chris? What the hell? Stewie, what are you doing? Uh, dining at the captain's table. Everyone at this table was the first person to refrigerate something. I refrigerated shoes. Because everybody likes a cool toe. Also, I gave the string quartet the sheet music for ""Highway to the Danger Zone"". You have the sheet music for ""Highway to the Danger Zone""? Uh, yeah. What do you think I keep in this backpack? It's all PowerBars and sheet music. Stewie, you're supposed to be looking for Chris. I did-- he wasn't in the Turkish bath, the veranda cafÃ© or the Bloody Handkerchief Ball. Oh, dear. Relax, Brian, I think I see Chris right now. Really? Where? I'm gonna go ahead and bet he's the guy with the whole chicken stuck on his head. Hey, you're not Chris. Pardon me, that's my hat! I know this thing's gonna sink, but I'm having a good time. Stewie, look! Chris, there you are! Well, well, well. If it isn't Booger Breath and the Mushroom Tip. Wh-Which one of us is which? Chris, we have got to get off this boat. The Titanic was one of the biggest disasters in history. Well, if you're so worried, why don't you alert the crew and save everyone? Because, Chris, we can't alter the past. That's the first rule of of, uh uh, dreaming. Besides, saving this ship would mean talking to, like, 80 people, and I-I'm just not in that kind of mood right now. Look, Chris, just give us that thing you took so we can all get home. Quick, Chris, Stewie, get on! To home! Or I'll just put in the coordinates. Damn! The return pad! It's been destroyed! What?! The whole thing's been waterlogged! I'll need to dry it out and completely rewire it. This would make a great movie. And the parts I need to fix the return pad certainly aren't on this ship. We have to somehow get to dry land. Dry land?! Stewie, almost everyone on the Titanic died! All right, calm down, Brian. No-- there's so much I haven't done. I've never even successfully made love to a woman in the shower. Aah, my back! Should I put my foot in the soap dish? Yeah, try that, and maybe stand on your tippy-toes. Aah, how does water make it dry?! This isn't gonna work. Brian, this is our only hope. The majority of people who got on those lifeboats were women of noble birth. Now, I've given us all backstories. I am Lady Antonia Tyler Carrington, the Duchess of Lancashire, the heir to the Earl of Portsmouth, and the cousin of the Countess of Wessex. Okay, great. And who are we? I don't know, you're just two sluts with me. Hey, there's a lifeboat. Uh, yeah, but it's got one of those funny Southwest lifeboat attendants. Hey, here's a reminder-- as you exit the boat, don't forget to give us your extra snacks because as you know, we work for peanuts! That's refreshing. Most of those guys are all serious. There, that one! It's our last chance. Hey, they learned it! What a bunch of pros. Hello there, sir. We are three noblewomen in distress Sorry, boat's full. Um, what if one of us were to turn this big ship into a ""tug"" boat? Wink, wink. Wouldn't help you. You're the fourth person to offer that, and I'm kind of spent. I don't believe this. Dear God, we're stuck here. We're going to drown on the Titanic. Oh, no, we're not. Hey! I said you can't come on here. Get out of my way, you son of a bitch! Oh, no! I can't swim without my striped one-piece! Everyone move over. We're getting on this boat. Please take my baby! Yeah, I'm sorry, if I take your baby, I'm gonna have to take everyone's baby. Can you believe that woman? Putting me on the spot in front of everyone. To home! You see what you started? Wow, Chris. You just saved our lives. Thank you. Oh, it was nothing, Brian. Listen, Chris, I, um I think I owe you an apology. I'm not someone who often makes mistakes, but, well, I was wrong earlier when I called you a moron. No, you were right. You're the smart one in the family, and I'm the dumb one. Oh, you're being too hard on yourself. Look, you may not be ""book smart"" or ""history smart,"" but you're ""throw people off the boat"" smart. And, frankly, I'm starting to think that's the best kind to be. Thanks, Stewie. Well, looks like one ship was saved today-- a relation-ship. Oh, thank God, we're back. Wow, what an adventure! Thanks, Dream Brian. Thanks, Dream Stewie. Brian, Stewie! I just had the most amazing dream. I was on a famous boat called the Gigantic. Yeah, he's gonna fail that test tomorrow. Well, we gave it our best shot, Stewie. It was still a nice thing you did for your brother. I suppose. I just hope that Chris killing one extra man on the Titanic didn't alter anything in the present. There he is. ""Nigel Harpington."" Wait, ""Harpington""? Isn't that the name of Chris' history teacher? Yes, I think you're right. That must be his ancestor. Which means that Chris' history teacher was never born. Hey, everybody, I'm Teacher Doug, and I don't believe in tests. Yay!"

Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Ugh, look at Miss Tammy. What a skank. She's free-muffin it at a baby school. Hi, Stewie. Mommy's here to pick you up. Why do you feel the need to narrate every little thing you do? Oh, hi, Mrs. Griffin. You know, I've actually been meaning to talk to you about Stewie. I'm concerned that he might have an attention problem. Attention problem? Yes, he's been a little difficult to deal with, and on page two of three in the How To Be a Teacher manual, it says that any child who's being difficult should be medicated. What?! Drugging a baby? Are you sure? That sounds so serious. I'm afraid his behavior has been an issue for a while. He's even been bothering students during nap time. Hey, you up? Guess where I have a crayon. So, I spend, like, $75 on cat toys, and what does she play with? A shoelace. That's crazy. Joe, that's been your answer every time I tell a story. It's like you're not even listening. Well, that's 'cause you interrupted me when I was telling you about Kevin trying to hang himself with an extension cord. I know, that's crazy. Hey, y'all want to try some of our new food? I'm trying to turn this place into a gastropub. These are Korean tacos, 'cause whatever the hell nowadays. Ugh! These are terrible! Quagmire, when it comes to tacos, I'll trust the Koreans, thank you. You're nuts. This tastes like Ani DiFranco after a bike ride. Geez, Quagmire, since when are you such an expert on food? For your information, I'm an excellent cook. You? A cook? Huh. What's your specialty? No-way soufflÃ©? I'm sorry, that was out of line. I am a good cook, and I'll prove it to you! Saturday night, you and all your wives are coming to my place for dinner. Fine. We'll be there. Ooh, can we make it Sunday? Saturday, I'm giving Javier Bardem a haircut. So, what'll it be? Everything. What do you mean? Long in the short places, short in the long places. It should be from both the future and the past. Something a child would do to a doll. Sorry, I just prefer to do number two at home. Where were we? It's Stewie, Dr. Hartman. He's having trouble focusing at school. Ah, yes. So you're telling me your baby won't sit still in a way that's convenient for his teacher? Yes. I'd heard stories, but never thought I'd see it with my own eyes. Mrs. Griffin, I'm going to write Stewie a prescription for ADHD medication. Really? Well, I don't know. Doesn't that stuff make you wired? Well, if you're low-energy and lethargic, yes. But if you're high energy, it actually calms you down and helps you focus. At least that's what I'm reading on WebMD. Wow, there are a lot of different kinds of medicines. There's a cat in here. Okay, I guess we can give it a try. Here you go. Now, who's this little guy? Wow, when did you learn to cook, Glenn? Well, as a young man, I found that a great meal was the quickest way to a woman's heart. How romantic. I mean, how do you think NBA players get all those chicks? They're all great cooks. Except Kobe Bryant. His-his his secret is different. Quagmire, you're really good. You could probably make money at this. Yeah, maybe you could open a restaurant. Or maybe get a cooking show. You know, the 11:30 cooking show on Channel Five needs a new host. The old one burned off his eyebrows, and was just too weird to look at. You should do it, Quagmire! I'll even come along and cheer you on! You'd do that for me? Course I would. I love cheering people on, like when I go to NASCAR. Go in a circle! Go in a circle! Go in a circle! Advertise stuff! Advertise Stu! Go in a circle! Hey, where's Stewie? Oh, he's probably sleeping off his pills. What? Well, the school said he had an attention problem, so Dr. Hartman gave him a prescription. You're giving a one-year-old drugs?! You're doping up a baby! Peter, are you okay with this? Will you stop talking? I'm trying to think about a girl I saw at the gas station. Stewie? Welcome to Pillow-World, Bri. Let me get up and greet you. There we go. How you doing? Oh, my God, Stewie, you're totally drugged out! You know something? I have been thinking about how everyone in this family, Brian, does their job. And they do a pretty good job of it. God, I'm really freaking out over this audition. What if I blow it? Quagmire, when I agreed to come to this, I didn't know it would require this level of emotional support. You Glenn Quagmire? I'm Carson, the producer of the show. Peter Griffin. I should be at work. Okay, let's see what you've got. I think you're gonna like this. Cedar plank salmon with a maple glaze and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes on a bed of mesclun greens. Hmm. Not bad. Also, the tomatoes can be eyes, and the lettuce can be hair. Look down. There's also a carrot. This is great! Terrific food and a hilarious sidekick? This! This is the show! What do you mean? I'm saying you're hired! Just as long as your friend joins you. What do you say, Peter? I say let's do it! Whoops. Uh, uh. Oh, I'm I'm sorry. What do I what-what do I do? I-I don't I don't know what to do now. That was the wrong choice, Peter. Wow, Quagmire, look at you! You're a real TV chef! I know. It might sound silly, but being a chef is something I've always dreamed about. I always dream about my house filling up with water. That's crazy. But anyway, thanks for encouraging me, Peter. All right, places! We're rolling in three, two, one. Welcome back to Quagmire's Kitchen. Now, this mince pie is about ready to go. Just needs a pinch of cinnamon. And while we're at it, how about we take the cinnamon challenge? Okay, Peter, we've all seen the Internet videos. We're not doing that. I was talking about something else. I was talking about a serious cooking thing. Now, the ingredients of a mince pie are traceable to the 13th century, when returning European crusaders brought back Middle Eastern recipes containing meats, fruits and-- oh, boy-- spices. Right here, I'm using cloves. Of course, most people associate mince pie with Christmas. But I'll be honest. I'm not afraid of a summer mince pie. I remember the first time I had mince pie. Our neighbor, Mrs. Morrin, introduced it to me one afternoon. Oh, God! I had house-sat for her Aah! while she was visiting her aunt in Vernon Oh, God. and she wanted to thank me. And, oh, boy, what a treat it was. You done? Yeah. All right, best two out of three, cinnamon. Still on those meds, huh? Uh, yeah, they, uh they help me to, um uh think. Okay, time for an eyes-open nap. God, look what those pills are doing to you. Putting you on that stuff was a huge mistake. Like inviting a turtle to a cocktail party. Hey. Ask me why they call me a box turtle. See, this is how American society treats unique, enthusiastic children. Instead of embracing their mental gifts, their first reaction is to shoot them up with hard-core drugs until they're mindless sheeple. All the better to send off to Kuwait and feed the Halliburton oil machine, right?! Bush. Yup. Takes all kinds. You know, a lot of kids at my school take ADD pills. They say if you're lazy and unmotivated, it makes you super energized and productive. Rea Really? Productive? Yeah. And college kids take it all the time so they can focus on their studies and drinking alcohol with their butts. Focus, huh? Okay, well, Stewie, these babies can help the garbage disposal focus because that's where they're going. No need to follow me, because I just said what I was gonna do. My God, I can't stop! The words are just pouring out of me! I have more energy than a guy who caught a T-shirt! My wife can wear this to sleep! My wife can wear this to sleep! Okay, today we're putting together duck breast medallions with a port wine reduction. And as I'm walking you through the steps, watch your screen for Junior Chef Peter's pop-up tips: helpful hints and food factoids to make your meal a success. Now, you're gonna want to start with a large, self-sealing plastic bag. And in that bag, we'll combine one large, finely-chopped garlic clove; one tablespoon of grated, peeled fresh ginger; two teaspoons of five-spice powder; a teaspoon of salt; and a half teaspoon of fresh ground pepper. Then you're gonna want to add the duck breasts, seal the bag, and refrigerate that for at least one hour, or up to 24 hours, if you want to prepare this ahead of time. Just make sure you remove the bag from the refrigerator one hour before cooking. You're gonna put that in your oven, preheated to 400 degrees. So we just spoon on the drippings, and that'll brown the skin nicely. If you bang these metal spoons on everything, it's like Stomp. Look at me! I'm huge in 2002! Peter Nothing like a night at the theater that ends in a headache! Damn it, Peter, that's it! I can't do this show with you anymore! You're fired! What?! You can't fire me! Only Mr. Spacely can fire me. Griffin you're fired! Okay, that's fair. Peter, can I come in? Hold on, let me put on my weird old actress turban. Yes? Listen, I saw what happened, but you should know, we at the station would hate to lose you. You're a big hit with the viewers. I will not work with that man again. I'm not asking you to. In fact, we'd like to offer you your own cooking show. Hmm, let me consult with my lawyer. Well, Peter, since the DUIs happened so close together, we don't really have much wiggle room here. I suggest you take the jail time and just get it over with. I'll do it. After October 13. Come on, Rupert. Wait-wait till you see this. This is really something special. Check out how much water is in the dehumidifier. Wow! That was all in the air. Brian? Is that is that, uh Is that, uh you? Stewie! Rearrange. Ewiets. Rearrange. Wieest. Restore. Stewie. Hey, come see what I've been working on. I call it Space Shire Seven. Nice, nice. It's like, uh, it's like a fake, uh, place you made? It's a medieval sci-fi universe, adaptable to TV, movies, toys, games, and mobile apps! I threw together a 2,000-page treatment last night. And I just figured, the hell with it, why not build a scale model and record voices for all the characters? Watch. Well met, stranger. Arasha deekaba plitcho. That's a Nebulon Mage. He speaks Ga'bi, this dumb language I wrote. It's then illegal? What? Hello? Okay, now we add the diced tomatoes. Just gonna keep going here. I like to drizzle these with a fig balsamic Damn it. What the hell is going on over there?!  I don't want   A place to stay  And that's my famous paella that looks and tastes just like a pizza bagel. It's a pizza bagel. Now, as always, add butter to taste. Mmm, delicious! Butter dunk! Stop it! Stop the show! What the hell are you doing? You're just pouring melted butter onto frozen foods. You're not a chef. Oh, really? Then why do I already have a restaurant in Orlando's largest indoor water park? This is an insult to anyone who cares about cooking. Either you leave the network or I do! Guys, guys, look, I know how a cook-off. Each of you cooks a meal using a secret ingredient, Iron Chef style. Will we be allowed to use calculators? Um, I I don't What? I say bring it on! Fine! A cook-off it is. See you in the kitchen, jerk. I'll see you in hell, loser. Bad day to carpool. Yeah. Okay, Joe, Peter and I are going head-to-head in that cooking competition, and they're letting us each use an assistant. Will you help me out? Okay, but just promise me there's no reading. I'm not a strong reader. What? I'm not illiterate, I'm just slow. What are you talking about? I never tried hard in school 'cause I could always run fast. So you're cool with being my chef helper for the big show? Sure, but I got to be honest-- if it ain't a fish with whiskers, I don't know what to do with it. But if it is? Then sweet sassy molassey! Great. Don't talk that way when we're on the show.    You're taking a chance   Risking it all   For the thrill of the moment   Taking a stand   You ain't gonna fall   And you've always known it   They're dying to shake you   Trying their best to break you   And though the going is rough   You're going home as a hero   'Cause there's thunder in your heart   Every move is like lightning   It's the power you feel   When you get your taste   Of the glory   You can light the dark   When they hear your heart of thunder.  Stewie! Stew-ez Canal. You're here! We got to get going. Going? Where? To Hartford, man. There's a book fair at the convention center, and George R. R. Martin will be there. Who-Who's that? Uh, Game of Thrones? Black shirts? Dandruff? Takes down more nerd chotch than anyone around? Okay. Anyway, I'm gonna show him my models and pitch him Space Shire Seven. Okay, before we go, I should wet my eyes. There.   Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker, and we have a fantastic cooking competition for you today with two fantastic chefs. Really? You couldn't find another adjective for ""fantastic""? Used ""fantastic"" twice? Who wrote this? Erica did. Wait, is that the one I called fat and we can't fire? Yeah. Let's get this contest started! Big whoop. I can do that. Oh, my God, Erica! You killed Erica! Fantastic. That's him. George R. R. Martin. God, he must be the coolest fat guy in a train conductor's cap in the world! Mr. Martin, I'm Brian Griffin, and I've got a pitch that's gonna blow you away. Are you sitting down? Almost always. Then join me on an interstellar crusade to Space Shire Seven! Our story begins in the distant galaxy of Warlock's Keep. Comet Castle falls. Samson Cyberblood is the new king of the star system. Long live Space Shire Seven, and long live the Hyperspeed Throne! So? What do you think? It was terrible. Ah, you're speaking the language of the Opposite Goblins. I'm very flattered. No, it's garbage. You just took a lot of pills, mashed together a bunch of sci-fi and fantasy clichÃ©s and crapped out a 2,000-page turd. Y-You could tell I was on medication? Oh, sure. But that stuff doesn't make you write well, it just makes you write a lot. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go wash the nerd chotch out of my beard. God. I didn't realize how those drugs were ruining me creatively. I haven't been feeling quite right either. Yesterday, I watched Chris shower for half an hour just because I thought it was the TV. He, um he lies on his back in there. Stewie, this drug is ruining us. We don't need these. You're right. These pills are for people with real problems. But there's nothing wrong with us. You're just lazy, I'm just excitable; we're-we're both normal. Now let's go home. That man is an imposter! I am George R. R. Martin! Whoa!   Let's begin the Channel Five Cook-Off. Remember, the winner gets to keep his TV show. And the secret ingredient is butter. Aw, sweet! No. That's Peter's specialty. I was hoping the secret ingredient would be popcorn shrimps. I liked smacking your butt earlier. Are the balls different from the cubes? God, what do I do? Joe, check if we have shallots! Okay. I can't see anything on the counter, but I'll do my best. Aah! Monster brains! Looks like Chef Griffin is preparing a delicious five-course butter feast. Son of a bitch, I never cook with butter. Joe, grab my recipe book and find a dish where I can substitute olive oil with butter. Joe, come on, hurry! I told you I'm not a strong reader! Damn it, Joe, pull it together! Hey, Quagmire, FYI, I got to take off in, like, ten minutes. I got a clarinet lesson. What?! Ugh. I can't do this. Aw, look at Quagmire. This was his dream. Time's almost up, Peter. We're gonna win! No, we're not. And in a stunning turn of events, Chef Griffin is eating his entire meal. He'll have nothing to serve. Well, that's it. If Chef Quagmire has prepared a dish of any kind, he wins this competition. Let's see what he has. A warm packet of tartar sauce brought in from somewhere else. ""When are you gonna use that?"" Bonnie said. We have a winner! Peter, you threw the cook-off for me? I couldn't take your dream away Heart attack! from you, buddy. You're the Mini stroke! one with the real Heart attack! talent. You Heart attack! deserve the show Regular stroke! not me. You're a good friend, Peter. But I don't want a show either. You don't? Of course not. I mean, look what the show did to us. It destroyed the most important friendship I have. Thanks. You know what? Let's end this for good. How? The same way Paula Deen got her cooking show taken off the air. By saying the one word you can't come back from. What? Say the word? Right now? Yeah. Together. Ready? You bet.  You could have just quit the show."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  We now return to The Autistic Postman Always Rings Four Hundred Times. So is everybody excited for Father's Day on Sunday? Oh, yeah, that's right. I always try to avoid Father's Day now. Every year, I used to take my dad to the horse track. Now we just go rooting around for bargains at the mall. Oh, this is darling, isn't it? Uh-huh. Glenn, do you think you'd see my bra through this blouse? Uh, I don't know. Is it too sheer? I don't know what that means. Glenn? Do you think it's too sheer? I said I don't know! Hey, Joe, you know, come to think of it, I've met Cleveland's dad, and my dog slept with Quagmire's dad, but I don't know anything about your dad. Yeah, is he still with us, or is he living in Heaven with Jesus Christ? Ugh, save that for your black friends. Eh, my dad's out there somewhere, but I haven't spoken to him in years. What?! Really?! Sorry, Cleveland, that was mean of me. I already forgave you. But, Joe, why haven't you seen your dad? Well, he's a good guy, but we just drifted apart. It's no big deal. It's a very big deal. My dad's a stinking drunk who lives in Ireland, but you got a perfectly good dad. You can't waste that. You gotta call him up for Father's Day. Peter, I don't even know where he is. Who's ready for another beer? Hey, Cleveland, weren't you supposed to buy the next round? That's a shame Joe never sees his dad. I know. Hey, you know what? Joe's our friend. He should be with his dad on Father's Day, and we're gonna track him down. Yeah, that's a good idea, Peter. Well, I like helping people out. That's why I was such a good break-up rodeo clown. I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you. I've been sleeping with your sister. What?! Hey, now! Hey, now! Over here! Over here! Over here! Hey, now! Hey, now! Over here! Over here! Hey, now! Hey, now! Over here! Over here! Oh, and now that I'm inside the barrel, he gave you and your sister HPV. Hey, want to see something? Check out how hot my last patient was. Oh. They look fake. Yeah, who cares? Okay, according to this projection, Stewie's adult height will be five-foot-one. What?! Five-foot-one?! Wow, Dr. Hartman, that's really short. I mean, I suppose it's fine if he's gonna die at 14. Is-is there anything on there about that? Well, we learned in medical school that the short ones do go faster, 'cause they smell more farts than the rest of us. This is terrible! I can't be short! I'll be an outcast, like Rudolph the Uncircumcised Reindeer. Look, Rudolph, it's not me, all right? It's Dasher, he's been complaining, and he is the one who has to look at it all night. I don't know. Mrs. Claus says it'll decrease my sensitivity. I-I'm sorry, why are you talking to my wife about this? Okay, you guys, it's all set. I found Joe's dad on the Internet, and he just e-mailed me to say he's coming tomorrow. All right, great, but remember, this is a surprise for Joe. Why are you looking at me? Because you're terrible at keeping secrets. No, I'm not; I'm great at it. Like when I was an OB/GYN. Well, I got the results of your ultrasound, and I got some news for you. Wait, wait, wait-- We don't want to know if it's a boy or a girl. Oh, okay. Well, it's not breathing. Hey, guys. Uh, uh, so, Joe, big day tomorrow, eh? Father's Day. Gonna be home all day, especially at 11:30 a.m.? Peter. What? I didn't say anything about his dad. My dad? What about my dad? Well, now that Quagmire ruined the surprise, we found your dad! You what?! That's right. He's coming tomorrow, for Father's Day. You shouldn't have done that, Peter. My father's not gonna be happy to see me. Sure he will. Just get him one of them Father's Day cards what plays a song. ""Dad to the Bone."" ""I'm Dad."" Pretty much anything with ""bad,"" you turn it to ""dad."" Wait, w-why wouldn't your dad be happy? What, is he a jerk or something? No, it's just that ever since I was a little kid, he was constantly making fun of handicapped people. Really? Yeah, my whole life, my-my dad would ridicule anyone in a wheelchair. It was all, ""Hey, spaghetti legs!"" And, ""Hey, rigatoni legs!"" And, uh, ""Hey, angel-hair legs!"" He was a sales manager at Ronzoni. Wow, then it must have been hard for him to accept when you were paralyzed. That's just it. My dad doesn't know I'm handicapped. I never told him. I never I never told him! Ah, Joe, don't cry. It's gonna make me cry. I cry like Snoopy. I can't believe you invited my father without telling me. You guys got to get in touch with him and tell him not to come. It's too late, Joe, he's already on his way. He is? Yeah, we got him tickets on Kayak. It is a nightmare itinerary. It was, like, 80 bucks, but he has four stops. Two of them are in Houston. What am I gonna do? My dad has no idea I'm paralyzed. Well, there's only one thing we can do. We'll just figure out a way to hide your handicap from your dad. Hide the fact that I can't walk? Peter, that'll never work. It's worth a try. Come on, Joe, don't be so negative. You're like a Boston fortune cookie. ""I don't know, numbnuts. Maybe buy a garage and fill it with hockey equipment."" Huh. Well, let's see what my lucky numbers are. ""Screw you, math dick."" Well, that wasn't very helpful at all. Here you go, Stewie. I know clothes shopping always cheers you up. I can't believe I'm only going to be five-foot-one. Aw, come on, look at the bright side. You'll be in the front row of every class picture. Holding that little plaque. You suck. Why don't you go drink out of the fountain? I'll text you when I'm done. I know you're trying to be rude, but I am gonna do that, because I find it enjoyable. Excuse me, I was looking at this. Sorry, I've made a decision to go for that shirt, and when that happens, it is on. Full throttle, man. Pow! Wow, you're an energetic little fellow. I guess your mommy lets you drink coffee, huh? Whoa, whoa, I-I don't put stimulants in my body. You know something? You kind of remind me of Tom Cruise. Boom. You-you got me, man. Wow, Tom Cruise. You look, um bigger in the movies. Wh-What are you doing here? Oh, I get all my clothes from out-of-the-way toddler stores. Ooh, uh, you want an animal cracker? Sure, you got a lion in there? Oh, no, I eat those first. I believe eating the lions gives me power. Yeah, I hear you believe in a lot of crazy stuff. What'd you get there? A giraffe? Yeah. Good, good. It's good for eyesight. Well, you're certainly upbeat. Let me ask you, doesn't it bother you being an adult man who's that short? 'Cause the doctor says that's where I'm headed. Oh, no way, man. The middle of the word ""short"" is ""or."" ""Or"" gives you a choice. And I choose not to be short. Wow, you need a road map for that one. Hey, hey, I'll tell you what. You spend the day with me, you'll see how great it is to be short. You'll feel like you're discovering a new world. And you know what's in the middle of the word ""world""? Um ""or""? Yes! The dots have appeared, man, let's connect them! You're you're a weirdo, but let's do this. All right, check it out, Bonnie. This is how we're gonna fool Joe's dad. Oh, my God. Yeah, looks real, right? I put this pair of pants on the front legs of this horse and strapped Joe to the front with his legs tied behind the horse's neck. And then we put Cinnamon's head up the back of Joe's shirt and simply hid the rest of the horse behind this curtain. His breath is very moist, Peter. And to induce movement, I'm gonna snap the horse's balls with this dampened kitchen towel. Aah! Oh, my God! Holy crap, he's out of control! Does it look real? Plan B! an B! Peter, I'm afraid this is hopeless. What, I don't know what else to do. I mean, we're not gonna come up with something better than the horse. Yeah, I guess you're just gonna have to tell your dad about your handicap. I can't do that. If you guys were in my shoes, you'd understand. Wait a minute, that's it! I will get in your shoes. I'll just pretend to be you. I mean, your dad ain't seen you in years. He won't know the difference. What? That's crazy. Boy, that was a close call. Is some of this room cold? All right, Peter, almost done. Huh? Huh? Eh, kind of. Yeah. I don't care. Peter, I don't know about this. It seems like a bad idea. Look, Lois, Joe is one of my best friends, all right? I'm only doing this to help him. Besides, wait till you hear my ""Joe"" voice. Uh, God, I hate being stuck in this chair. No, Peter, that fights it.  Oh, yeah   Mr. Big Stuff   Who do you think you are?   Mr. Big Stuff   You're never gonna get my love   Now because you wear   All those fancy clothes   Oh, yeah   And have a big fine car   Oh, yes, you do now   Do you think I can afford   To give you my love   Oh, yeah   You think you're higher than every star above   Mr. Big Stuff   Who do you think you are?   Mr. Big Stuff   You're never gonna make me cry   Mr. Big Stuff   Tell me, tell me  That's Bud. Are you ready, Peter? I think so. What do you think, acting coach? I think you will be exemplary, Peter. All good acting coaches are insane old ladies. Emote! Hi, Bud. Hi, Joe's dad. Uh, I mean, uh, Dad. Uh, Joe, I'm Joe; you're my dad. Joe? Wow, I guess it really has been a long time. I barely recognize you. Put on a little weight, haven't you? Well, I could say the same for you. Sometimes I don't understand why people laugh. All right, everyone in the car. We got a Father's Day dinner reservation. Why is Mr. Swanson coming? And why is he dressed like Dad? I don't know, kids. I stopped asking after your father said he shot a horse. Thanks for the ride-along. I liked when you sentenced those two girls to kiss each other. Yeah, all girls are lesbians when you point a gun at 'em. Boy, it's been great spending time with you, son. It's been great spending time with you, too Dad. Oh, this'll be fun. Let's see how long it takes them to get Gumby over there into the car. Yeah, that's our neighbor, Peter Griffin. That's the guy who e-mailed me? Huh, no wonder it was all caps with tons of typos. He's a water head, right? Yeah, he's a mess. Look at his ugly kids. Pathetic. Ugh, he's not fitting. Just put some of him in the back like skis. Hey, Stewie. What's up? When you say it like that, you sound just like Tom Cruise. What? Oh, yeah, I've been hanging with Tom Cruise. You've been hanging out with Tom Cruise? Sure have. We spent the whole day together, and he showed me there's a lot of advantages to being short. Oh, yeah? Like what? You're the last one to get wet when it rains? Well, yeah, that. And you can chow pie standing up. We didn't do any of that, but the point is, I'm at peace with being short. Full throttle, man! Pow! Hello? Oh, hi, Dr. Hartman. Mrs. Griffin, I have some good news. Turns out your son is going to be normal height. I read his chart wrong yesterday. Apparently, I have something called ""dislooxia""? That was the doctor. Apparently, Stewie's not gonna be short after all. What? Really? That's wonderful news! Oh, I'm so relieved my child is spared some heartache. Now, come on, Brian, I guess we should try to make it over to Meg's birthday party. Could I have some bread while I open my presents? At this point, we're gonna have to start charging you for the bread. Hey, Stewie! You want to check out the go-kart I used in Days of Thunder? Yeah, listen, um I just found out I'm actually going to be tall, so I'm no longer comfortable hanging out with someone whose teeth are bigger than their fingers. What? That's that's barely true. Yeah, so see you later. You are making a big mistake, Stewie! Nobody walks away from Tiny Tom Cruise! Yeah, except for all three of your wives. Okay, I'm shutting this now. Okay, so bye! So now, since I switched to disposable catheters, I no longer have those beet-red infections in my urethra. Oh, no. I hope it's not genetic. Chris, he's not our dad. I can't keep up with this ruse. Hey, everybody! Peter, finally, you're home. How's it going over there with my dad? Awesome. He fell for the whole thing. In fact, we've been having a great time! Wow, that's terrific, Peter! You'll only have to pull it off for a few more hours. Then he'll be on a plane tomorrow and I can go home. Oh, that's the other good news. Bud's not leaving! I told him he can move in with me and Bonnie. What?! Peter, this is crazy! Na it's gonna work out fine. Oh, and remember, Joe, if Lois is feeling frisky at night, it's index finger around and clockwise. And just keep doing that to yourself until you're good to go. Peter, this is ridiculous. You can't live in my house with my dad and my family! Your dad got me super clean in the tub. Joe's right, this is idiotic. What are you thinking? I'll tell you what I'm thinking. I'm thinking that I've had two dads and neither one cared for me as much as Bud does. Peter, I've had enough of this! You can't just take my dad! Well, he's right next door. Nothing's stopping you from going over there and telling him the truth: that his son is a paraplegic who's stuck in a wheelchair. You know I can't do that. Ah, suit yourself. But I gotta go. Me and Bud are having a blast. I'm sorry, Joe. A-Are you okay? Not really. I'll be honest, Lois, this hurts. Hurts like the Dickens. I've finished my latest novel. Splendid, Charles! What is it called? Oliver Nipple-Twist. Ow! Oh, Charles, you bastard! Yeah! The Dickens! It hurts like the me! So, anyone going to the gerbil's funeral on Friday? Okay, kids! Everyone in a circle for parachute time. Oh, goodie, I love parachute time! Whee! Whee! Whee! What the hell? That kid looked like Tiny Tom Cruise. Whee! Huh. Must've been my imagination. Aah! If you think you're getting away from me, you've got a crazy laugh coming, friend. Aah! Hey, what are you doing home so early? He's following me, Brian! Who's following you? Tom Cruise! I spend one afternoon with the guy, and it's like I signed an eight-year contract to show up at events with him and let him fake-father a child. Stewie, I would think Tom Cruise has better things to do than follow you around. Oh, really? Well, explain that! You know, it's times like this where I think, if I didn't talk and you were a normal baby, we wouldn't have any of these problems. You gotta help me get rid of him, Brian! He's creepier than that guy at the gym who just does karate in the mirror. It's me. The guy's me. I'm a gym karate creep. I'm pretty good, too. But relax. If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead. Hey, Dad, what do you say we go play catch? And throw me some divers. I want to get grass stains on my school slacks. What? You're a grown man. I know, it's just so great having a dad. Well, it's nice having reconnected with you, too. All right, let's do it. Oh, for God's sake. See, a guy like that should just stay inside so we don't have to look at him. Joe, go over there and tell him to get back in his house. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Joe, you gotta go inside. You're upsetting my dad. Your dad? That's right! He loves me in a way that Aw, you guys had pizza? Screw you, Peter! You know what? This is over! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Not a chance. I like your house better. I got nothing to hold onto when I poop at home. You have no idea how many shower curtains I've ripped down. Now get inside. No, I'm not gonna do that. Oh, yes, you are! Get away from me, you son of a bitch! What the hell? Joe, don't take that from him! How do you like that? You're getting your ass kicked by a cripple! A helpless, spaghetti-legged cripple! What are you doing? You're my son! You can't let yourself get beat up by a guy in a wheelchair! Your son is a guy in a wheelchair. What are you talking about? Yes. Yes, Dad. It's me. Joe! What the hell happened to you? I was shot in the line of duty. ""Line of duty."" So, this is why you haven't called me in all these years? How could I, Dad? You always made fun of handicapped people. The only thing I never understood was why? I don't know. I guess I could never stand the thought of something like that happening to me. Or even worse, to someone that I care about. One time, my legs fell asleep on the toilet. I had to crawl into the living room and interrupt Lois's book club. That was one of the shower curtains I ripped down. And I suppose, deep down, I was afraid. Afraid that, if it did happen, I wouldn't be strong enough to handle it. Well, Dad, I can tell you from experience it's only when your worst fears come true that you get to find out how strong you really are. Then I guess I've got some learning to do. I love you, son. I love you, too, Dad. I love you, too, Dad. Hey, Joe, uh, just one question: why do you have all those Wizard of Oz plates? Because if I finish my vegetables, I get to see the Yellow Brick Road. All right, you sold me. All right, Brian, Tiny Tom Cruise is somewhere close. I can sense his manic energy. You remember the plan? Yup, I got it. Help, help! My dog got off his leash! Is there anyone who can do a pumpy-arm run? Running, running, running, running, running, running, run! Hey, Stewie. I'm here to help you for the next billion years. All right, good to know. Anyway, my dog ran around those bushes. I am on it! Gotcha! All right, off to Zappos with him. You sure this is gonna work? Oh, yeah. They'll accept any returns. We don't even have to pay postage. Hello, friend. Your life is about to change. Hey, Tom. It's been a couple weeks. Hey, listen, Joe, I'm sorry I treated you like such a jerk. Well, that's okay, Peter. In fact, I got to say, it was a nice thing you did. I'm glad I reconnected with my dad after all these years. Ah, it was my pleasure. There's no more important relationship than I'm sorry, Cleveland, what the hell is that Toronto Raptors hat? It was my Father's Day present. I hate it. I'm just gonna wear it for a week then say I lost it. Anyway, thanks for helping me, Peter. Yeah, it all worked out great, Joe. Except I am still missing that one pair of pants. Excuse me, are those Bugle Boy jeans?"

TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to Stand-Up Specials from Comedians You've Been Told to Like. Please welcome Aziz Ansari! What's up, y'all? Sometimes I start a sentence really soft and then get loud! (laughs) He's hilarious 'cause I saw him in a other show. What are you talking about? How is that funny? He didn't even tell any jokes. Uh, if he didn't tell jokes, why was he laughing? Well, that's about as much HBO as we're gonna get before they play something homosexual. Come on, Chris. God, that's what passes for comedy these days? What ever happened to our venerated humorists? Here we go. Samuel Clemens, Mark Twain. Same guy. Huck Finn. Not a guy. Look, the point is, I could do stand-up comedy. All I'd need is a newspaper and this twisted mind. Why waste your time with stand-up, grandpa? All the best comedy is on Twitter now. Really? Yeah. Stand-up is so Twitter's only three years ago. Check mine out. I've got 10,000 followers. ""I feel like we should wait to hear ""Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides."" Who's Adele? Just keep reading. ""Hey, short guys, ""the more muscular you get, the shorter you look. Did you not know that?"" Well, that one seems a little mean. Just give me the phone. No, no. ""I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City."" Was it a re-run on basic cable, because sometimes they edit those a lot and that could be why you were confused? Hmm, that's interesting, Brian. A girl in Iowa asked me the same question. You know what I did? I flew her out here and (bleep) (bleep) her in the face. So, yeah Twitter. Look, those are cute blurbs, Stewie, but I-I think I'm gonna put together a real act for real people. (scoffs) Good luck. God, it's like I'm the only person in the house who gets social media. LOIS: That'll get it started. Where the hell's Peter? I'm almost done doing the 45 minutes of stuff a woman my age needs to do right before bed. I can't even remember why I sleep in this belt anymore. (slurring): Hey, Chris, don't tell your mom I threw up in the Crock-Pot. Peter, it's me. Oh. Uh, I'll be right back. I gotta go tell Chris somethin' gross. Just come to bed. All right, fine, but I'm not gonna brush my teeth and I'm gonna fart super hot. Get up. You're on my side of the bed. Peter! We act like we didn't take a lot from The Simpsons, but we took a lot from The Simpsons. Damn it. Oh, my God, what happened to your side of the bed? These springs are shot. And it's all damp over here! Are are these mushrooms? That's where Smurfs is. Er, are. Uh Smurves. Uh, hey, who handles multimedia here? Because, uh, I have a slide of the Capitol building that I'd like projected behind me. And, yes, it is supposed to be upside-down. You a comic? Satirist, yes. (Spanish accent): What is with all the bad cleaning supplies, am I right? I mean, Mr. Clean? More like Mr. Hard-to-Clean. Fantastik? More like terrible. Windex? More like Lose-Dex. MAN: Get off the stage! No, no, no. (H. Jon Benjamin's voice): All right, you guys like impressions? Here's that guy Bob from Bob's Burgers. Hi, I'm Bob from Bob's Burgers. How 'bout that show Archer? You watch that show Archer? Here's that guy Archer. Hi, I'm Archer, from that show Archer. Now, what if those guys met? ""Hey, Archer, it's Bob."" ""Hey, Bob, it's Archer."" Thank you. Next up, let's keep it going for Brian Griffin. (applause) All right, thanks. Hey, sorry I was late getting here tonight, I was caught in gridlock. And then I left Congress. (silence) There was there was supposed to be an upside-down picture of the Capitol behind me. Boy, awfully quiet in here. Sounds like John Boehner talking about poverty. Whoosh. (chuckles) Hey, so, um you know, maybe it's me, but I kind of feel like we should wait to hear Adele's ex-boyfriend's songs before we choose sides. (laughing, cheering) Yeah, and and and hey, short guys, the more muscular you get, the shorter you look. Did you not know that? (audience laughing) Wow. This is easier than getting your Jet Ski license. All right, Kyle, lookin' good. You got 100% on your written test, water test. Just one last question. Have you ever had a fistfight with your stepdad? Which stepdad? You passed! Here's your license. Go be a dick. Oh, Lois, I slept great on your side of the bed. Oh, and I read your journal. Boy, you really hate ""P-period G-period."" Peter, our mattress is a disaster. We're buying a new one today. Does that mean I can skip work? Well, it's 2:45, so I guess yes. Hey. So, how'd it go last night? Well, let's just say I got asked to come back tonight. You're kidding. It actually went over well? I figured you'd be terrible. Why would you think that? Well, I know a thing or two about performing. I mean, after all, I was Vin Diesel's acting coach. Okay, Vin, I like what you're doing there, but I want you to try it one more time, like this: ""Duh!"" Look around, and let me know if you have any questions. Oh, I have one. What percentage of Hayden Panettiere is dwarf? Well, you're the expert. What kind of mattress do you have? Currently, I'm staying with a friend, on an air mattress in his laundry room. It's temporary. No, it's not. No. Okay, well, thanks, we'll just try a few out. I hope you don't mind, I brought my CPAP machine. Also, I like to eat a big bowl of berries before I go to sleep. Well, what do you think, Peter? Well, it seems good, but I won't know for sure until I have my evening tug. I think we like this one. W-What's it called? Deep Slumber 3000. You're buying it on Amazon, aren't you? Yup. They have drones now. (drone whirring) Oh, come on, Peter, we gotta beat the drone to the house! Real stores suck! So I was wondering why this tampon commercial was so long, until I realized it was a re-run of Sex and the City. (laughter) Okay, you guys have been great. Good night. (applause) Funny stuff. Hey, uh Stewie! You, uh, you caught the show? You bloody thief! Every joke you told up there was stolen from me! Stewie, relax. You know what? That's it! You and I are no longer friends! (toilet flushes) WOMAN: Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God. Oh, it's everywhere! Hey, Stewie, you got a second? I have nothing to say to you, Brian. Besides, I'm busy playing with my new friend. What new friend? (electronic whirring, beeping) Is this dog bothering you, Stewie? What the hell? You couldn't find a real friend so you built a robot? Oh, not a robot, Brian. He's a human mind model adaptive super computer. I've even programmed him to learn and grow smarter. His name is Lyle. Stewie, perhaps we should offer this guest a beverage. Or simply lift the toilet seat. Ooh! Snap, Brian! (tinny version of ""Gloria"" by Laura Branigan playing)  Gloria  What the hell's going on? What's going on? You've been ""Lyle'd""!  Gloria   I think they got the alias   Gloria.    (song ends) Wow. Didn't know we'd have to hear the whole song. You built a robot? This is pathetic, Stewie. You ally must be desperate for friends. Oh, I'm desperate? Lyle, access Brian's phone. Look at that, you only have four contacts. And oh, my God, you downloaded the Dunkin' Donuts app? And who Shazams the Beatles? Whatever. Have fun with your little robot. But if you ask me, this whole thing is more disturbing than a dump after a beet salad. (man screams) Oh, right. Okay, Lois, I dabbed some toothpaste on the inside of my nose, so I am willing to take the old ""Nestea plunge,"" if you know what I mean. I guess what I'm saying is, time to break in the new mattress, eh? Peter, it's brand-new. I don't want to mess it up. Come on, we won't make a mess. When we're done, I'll grab you by the ankles and lift you up like a dirty garbage bag. No! This mattress was expensive, and I'd like to keep it nice for a little while. Are you serious? We can't do it? For how long? I don't know. L-Let's just keep it new for a few weeks. A few weeks?! Come on, you know I'm terrible at waiting for things. We'll be right back with more Laverne & Shirley. But I want it now! All right, Lyle, one thing buddies do together is go to the movies and talk about it afterwards. I'm going to bed. Yeah. Oh, Lyle, I'm so glad I have you as a friend. Now I can do fun things like get on your shoulders and wear a trench coat and be tall enough to ride roller coasters. Hello, fellow adult. I am clearly above the minimum height requirement and shall now ride your roller coaster, for which you are an attendant. Yes, and I will operate this roller coaster, as I am an adult who is licensed to do so. Hey! Oh, no! It's the manager. Run! You get out of here, you kids who are just kids and not an adult like me! I do so enjoy our time together, Lyle. In fact, I drew you a little keepsake. It's a picture of a mailman wearing a cowboy hat. Just a silly thing. Thank you, Stewie. I drew you something as well. It's an urban plan for a workable Palestinian state. My word, this is very impressive. The credit is yours, Stewie. It was you who programmed me to grow exponentially smarter. Ah, I suppose you're right. As Kahlil Gilbane wrote in The Prophet, ""I am the bow from which the arrow of you was launched."" It is Kahlil Gibran. ""Gilbane"" is a construction company in Providence. Ah, yes, I see I see the-the name on the trucks. So it's ea um, easy mix up there. In any case, Lyle, I'm very proud of you and your progress. You, my friend, are the greatest invention since the Trapper Creeper. Ah Um, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. (imitates motorboat) Well, wouldn't you know it, I moved the van over to the other gas pump, and the gas cap was still on the wrong side. (laughs) Boy, that was one trip to the lake we're not gonna forget. Shut the hell up, will you, Joe? Geez, what's your problem, Peter? I-I'm sorry, guys, I guess I'm just a little on edge. I'm not getting any from Lois. Is it 'cause Lois is going through the change? Donna's getting a tiny mustache. I told her it felt like I was kissing Ernie Hudson. That turned out to be a mistake. No, no, it's 'cause we got this new mattress, and Lois doesn't want to mess it up. What kind of mattress did you get? I hope you did your homework, because you're gonna spend a third of your life on that thing. I swear to God, Joe Look, Peter, the answer is obvious. If Lois won't sleep with you on the new mattress, we just got to get your old mattress back. Oh, my God, Quagmire, that's a great idea. She won't care about messing up the old mattress. But you already got rid of it. You'll never find that thing. Well, we're just gonna have to. Man, I haven't been this desperate to find something since Meg was kidnapped by that maniac. It puts the lotion on its skin. (door opens) Oh, Meg, thank God I found you. Hey, remember how you borrowed my club card for the grocery store? Could you toss that up to me? Oh, you don't have to have the card. You can just give them your phone number. Oh, really? Hey, thanks, man. Hey, Meg, I like your new boyfriend. Every pot finds a lid, huh? (chuckles) Have fun, you kids. (door closes) Lyle, we finally got a thank you note from Bella for that birthday party present. With a single mom, I didn't know for sure if it was coming, but What what's going on here? Hello, Stewie. I've built a few friends for myself. You have? I'm sorry, but I've outpaced your intelligence. I needed to create some friends who are my cognitive peers. Meet Ted R. and Ted P. Are they doing math on glass?! And invading each other's personal space? That means they have Asperger's, the smartest mental impairment there is. Stewie, I'm afraid I no longer have time for a friend of your simple ways. I must ask you to leave. No, he must Asperger you to leave. Ho-ho. You've been ""Ted R.'d."" (Ricky Martin's ""The Cup of Life"" plays) That was mean. But I like that song. Is he sad? I can't tell if he's sad. Finally, Stewie's back from the store. Yes, I'm sorry it took me so long. But I got the garlic blue cheese salad dressing you wanted. Does that mean I'm in the crew now? It does if you drink the whole bottle while we watch. Um, okay. (gulping) Oh Oh, my God. It's so salty. (gulping) Oh, and chunky right when you don't want it to be. (gulping) (gasping) There, I did it. We're friends now, right? Maybe. How about you throw it all up back into the bottle? But don't spill a drop. Okay, okay.. Okay, I can do that. Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I forgot to purse my lips. I'll go get another bottle and try again. (crying, retching) I bet the mall around here sucks. Peter, what are we doing here? I thought we were looking for your mattress. We are, this is a They use old mattresses to pad the walls of the cells. (doorbell chimes) May I help you? Yes, 1950s doctor, me and my friends are looking for You're friends with a Negro and a cripple? This man is insane. Take him away. Now wait a second, you can't do that to A Negro speaking up to a white person? This man is insane. Now look, I don't think All cripples are insane. Euthanize this man. Something I can help you with? Yeah, you got any brain-dead women in there you let people have sex with for a few bucks? Sure, come on back. Well, Peter, I don't think you can go any farther down the ladder than porno people. So if your mattress isn't here, I'm afraid it's gone. Hey, I bet that's it. Get up, lady, that's my mattress. Oh, my God, Bruce, you do porn? Nah, I's part of the crew. I mostly just powder the ding-dongs. This ain't your mattress, buddy. We just got it, fresh off the boat from Eastern Europe. (female Eastern European accent): I was told I would have job as Au pair. Instead I am just bang slab. Ah, damn it. We did get another one yesterday, but some fat-ass blew out half the springs, so we put lunch on it. (gasps) My mattress. Hey, we found it. All right, let's get her out of here. I got to tell you guys, I am so happy we found this. It's like when I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill. That's it? It's just a bunch of blueberries? Ah, two dogs humping. Ah, this was worth the four-hour flight. Oh, my God, Stewie. What are you doing in the toilet with the lid closed? Ted R. says this is where a piece of crap has to live. This is terrible. Those robots are not your friends. Yeah, well, at least they don't steal from me. Look, I'm really sorry I stole your jokes. It was a rotten thing to do. You may not want me back as a friend, but you deserve better than those robots. Of course I want you back, Brian. The fact is-- I miss hanging out with you. I'll tell you what, let's hang out tonight after they see how many slaps it takes to give me a stutter. Utewie, you got to put a stop to this. I mean, you made them-- you can destroy them. What do you say you and I, we take these robots out? You'd you'd help me do that? Of course, Stewie, I'm your friend. All right, let's do it. Thank you, Brian. Okay, let's wrap it up. I reserved this time to listen to Metallica and flex in the mirror. He's right; it's on the whiteboard. Peter, what is that? This, Lois, is our old mattress. Well, get it out of here. It smells like John Popper's cargo shorts. No, it smells like our marriage. What?! Don't you see, Lois? This mattress is a living tapestry of everything we've done together. Every stain, a story. Every smudge, a chapter in our family's life. This mark here is from where we conceived Meg. Over here was Chris. And all the way up here was Stewie, 'cause, remember, you coughed up all that pool water? Oh, Peter, you were so handsome. Lois, this mattress may be old and worn-in, but so are we. And I wouldn't trade you in for anything. You know, I, uh, think I still got a stain or two left inside me. (giggling): Oh, Peter. PETER: Yeah, I want to do you right where the porn lunch was. LOIS: What? PETER: I said, I want to do you right where the porn lunch was. God, I wish you'd listen. Stewie, three more Arnold Palmers. Boy, we're destroying them at the right time, Brian. I don't have enough iced tea for the correct ratio. It'll be too lemonade-y. They'll be furious. All right, so let's do it. Let's take 'em out. I'll warn you, it's not gonna be easy. They're incredibly intelligent and getting smarter by the minute. I designed them to be constantly adapting It's done, I sprayed 'em with the hose. (electrical crackling) Ah, boy, that was the best night's sleep I've had in a long time, Lois. Same with me. You know, I'm glad we're keeping our old mattress. Sometimes newer isn't better. Yeah. Are your privates itchy, too, or just mine? No, they're itchy. Maybe we should keep the new mattress. Way ahead of you, Lois. I already dragged the old one out to the curb. Good. Okay, I'm gonna go rub up against the basement doorjamb. Stewie, I really am sorry about what happened. Oh, don't mention it. I'm just glad to have the whole mess behind us. So what'd you end up doing with those old robots anyway? I just left them out on the curb for the trash man. How can this not be a trap?"

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Aw, man, I've been dying to see Maniac Pope 2. The first one was awesome. Is this one of those theaters where they bring your beef stew right to your seat? What? That's not a thing. Sure is. Don't get mad at me 'cause you don't know nothing fancy. I feel like I'm being watched. Of course you are, silly. The Lord is always watching us. (suspenseful music plays) May the sword be with you. (screams) And also with you! Geez, this movie sucks. I know, it's terrible. (whispering): Excuse me, who had the stroganoff with the roasted potatoes? CLEVELAND: Right here. Thank you for seeing me, Your Excellency. Of course. What did you say your name was, my child? Lucy. You've been ""Lucified."" That was awful. I know, they just redid all the same stuff from the first Maniac Pope. Yeah, like in the first Maniac Pope, he says to Bruce, ""You've been Brucified."" Like, that's smart, right? That's a smart line. But he did the same thing twice in this movie. Once to Lucy and once earlier when he found that wild goose. It's just bad writing. Yeah, I mean, we could write a better horror movie than that. Really? You think we could? Absolutely, I'm as creative as the first spider to spin a web. Hey, you know how we always dreamed about having a house that comes out of our butts? Uh, what? Eh? Yeah. Butt-house. I found your cigarettes. That's all I'm gonna say. Morning, everybody. And the crisis continues. (chuckling): What, these? Come on. Last thing I want is attention. It's just that when you've read as many books as I have, it-it takes a toll, you know? You sure it's not from watching too much close-up porn on your phone? (chuckling): You know, I wouldn't be surprised if they have that now. Brian, what do you want for breakfast? Uh, hold on. What do I want? You're so full of it. You don't need those things. Wait, who said that? Oh, Stewie. You are just horrible. You're even worse than those people who take dumps in the shower. What? W-Why are you cutting to me? What did somebody say? Whatever they said I do, I don't do. All right, I got a horror movie idea. It's called Cereal Killer. A serial killer who only kills people who eat cereal. Wait, what what if God is a serial killer? He lowers the average lifespan of humans to 65, but there are many exceptions based on genetics and diet. That's stupid-- I ain't never heard of somebody lived to 65. Look, I think the problem is this is a bar. We can't get inspired here. We have to go someplace scary, you know? To put us in the mood. I got it: the old Quahog Asylum. What?! We can't go there. That place has been abandoned for years. And they say it's haunted by a ghost with a hook-hand. That's why it's the perfect place. If we want to write a scary movie, we need to do it somewhere scary. Well, I guess we could try it. We have sort of just been spinning our wheels here. No offense, Joe. (sighs) I guess Cleveland's right. So far, this has been a bigger waste of time than an acceptance speech at the Asperger's Awards. I'd like to thank everyone I've ever met, in the order that I met them, last name first, and if anyone interrupts me, I'll have to start over. (thunder crashes)   (thunder crashes) This place is terrible. Are you kidding? It's the perfect place to write a horror movie. All right, well, I got an idea. You know, I like them horror movies where you got a couple of teenagers getting busy in their car at Makeout Point, but there's a killer on the loose. He Stacy, what do you say we go all the way tonight? And then I unload on the sun visors. Is that all you ever think about? And besides, Richie, aren't you worried about what the man on the radio is saying right now? TOM TUCKER: Another dead teenage couple was found at Makeout Point, clawed beyond recognition. You see? There's a dangerous creature out there. Oh, what, you mean the big, rabid, slobbery cat what's been scratching people to death? I don't believe it exists, Stacy. Now, help me get the right angle and lower the visor. (cat yowls in distance) Richie, did you hear that? Will you calm down? We're the only ones out here (screams) Rrrawwwr! (screaming) (screams) Oh, my God! (screaming) (screaming) (screaming) (howls) Wait, you were the guy and the cat? And what's with that visor stuff? Did Richie achieve release? Okay, of the three of you, Cleveland's the only one who gets it. That's an awful idea. Well, I got one. We should write one of them zombie movies where a guy wakes up in a comfortable cotton hospital gown with the back open so there's a nice breeze on your behind, and he's like, ""This ain't bad."" But then he notices the hospital's empty. Nurse, I'm ready for my sponge bath. Hmm. What happened to this place? Everybody up and gone. (electrical crackling) Hmm, that's annoying. (static hissing) Maybe it's a loose filament. (rattling) Nope, that's a busted bulb. These are all 145s. I need a 180. Well, now, maybe I did need a 145. There we go. (pops) Damn it, I guess it's a wiring issue. That's it? What the hell? When do the zombies show up? That's the thing. Their shuttle was late. I-I don't know, I-I was thinking we'd write a movie where something that's not supposed to be scary becomes scary. Like an evil doll. Yeah, or-or like an evil bar of soap. Peter, I don't think that's such a good id Too late. Oh, yeah, that's nice. Time to wash my body with this harmless bar of soap. (dramatic music plays) Hey, Ambassador Mumbasa, are you enjoying that new soap I bought you from that mysterious Chinese man whose store was weirdly not there the next day? Ambassador Mumbasa? Oh, my God, Ambassador Mumbasa! (dramatic music plays) (screams) Ambassador Mumbasa? Assistant Ambassador Armstrong? Everything okay up there with the bath? (screams) (gasps) I wonder if everything's okay up at the old embassy. (wind howling, door slams) All right, maybe coming here wasn't such a great idea. Is anybody else getting a little freaked out by all these scary stories? Yeah, even my spine is tingling. You guys, I'm scared. You remember that movie, The Blob? What if the Blob? Let's get out of here. Aw, damn it, it's locked! Oh, my God, somebody must have locked us in. We're gonna die in here! (female screams) Sorry, guys, somebody e-mailed me a video of a sheep screaming. (screams) It was him. It was the hook-handed killer. He locked us in! All the windows have bars on 'em. I think the only way out of here is through this duct system. Guys, do the words ""dead by dawn"" scrawled in feces over there mean we're in trouble? Did you do it? I did. Then no. Still sticking with the glasses, huh? What? Oh, right. Right, I have glasses. They're such a part of me now, I-I forgot all about 'em. You're gross. You know, it's funny, I-I've gotten an awful lot of writing done You're a writer? (Stewie groans) I-I like to consider myself an observer. (chuckles) You have nice breasts, for instance. (chuckles) You want to join me? Guy with glasses can't be all bad. Thanks. Boy, it's loud in here, huh? Wh-When they said ""Professor Griffin,"" I barely heard them. That's it, I'm putting an end to this. I'm gonna destroy those glasses if it's the last thing I do. You should really check out the Thanksgiving jazz CD they sell here. (screaming) Where the hell are we? (footsteps echo) I heard something. Is is someone else here? Oh, my God, it's Hook-hand! He's coming for us! Damn it, why can't I get any reception? Because we're in a basement in the middle of nowhere. Besides, if cell phones worked, every movie would be two minutes long. Like An Affair to Remember. (tires screeching)   Darling, I was running to the Empire State Building to see you, but I got hit by a car. No wonder you were late. I'll be right down. Are you okay? I think I may be paralyzed. I'm sorry, there's nobody here by that name. (beeps)   Wow, Stewie, thanks for taking me to the spa. Hey, you deserve it, buddy. So just relax, take your glasses off, take a nice, dry sauna-- no glasses in the sauna-- just leave those puppies in the locker. They'll be safe out here. Sounds good. (quietly): Come on, Chris. Don't let me down. CHRIS: Don't worry, Stewie. Chris! What are you doing in here? I did it. I locked us in the sauna! You what?! Yep, it's all set. It's turned up high, and nobody is coming for the whole weekend. (pounding) (gasping, panting) Boy, you guys sure look steamed. ANNOUNCER: This Family Guy joke was written by Jimmy Sullivan, age nine, of Decatur, Georgia. Thanks, Jimmy! And we'll pass along your gross request to Mila Kunis. (water dripping) (footsteps approaching) Those footsteps are getting closer. Those aren't footsteps. It's an old building. Just relax. Besides, I can see an exit door right there. Where? Right there. Behind that guy with the hook-- (terrified screaming) (screaming) Everybody run! (Joe screaming) (thunder crashes) (screams) Wait a minute. There's four of us, and one of him. Yeah, let's get him! (yelling) Son of a bitch! Take that! Die, Hook-hand! You won't kill us! Um, Hook-hand's name is Albert, and he's dressed like a janitor. (groans) I've been trying to help you. I'm the caretaker here. Wait, you work here? But you have a hook hand. I was a soldier. I lost my hand saving six men in Korea. Oh, God, he's a war hero. (exhales) He's dead. What have we done? We killed an innocent man. Well, if this doesn't justify a McFlurry, nothing does. Oh, my God, we killed an innocent man. We-we've got to report this! We gotta turn ourselves in! No way. If we do that, we'll all go to jail. And I'm a cop. Do you know what they do to cops in jail? Hey, man? When you were a cop, did they-- did they let you use the siren? Yeah, it's part of the job. That's so cool! Hey, hey, when you were a cop, when you were going to a crime scene, did you go ""chung Chung,"" like Law & Order? No, that would be very unprofessional. All right, all right. Oh, hey, check it out, man, when you were a cop, did you ever, you know, use your handcuffs when you were getting kinky with your girl? No, it's city property, so you're not really supposed to take those home. Oh, for sure, for sure. Oh, hey, by the way, a bunch of us are gonna kill you in the shower later. Okay, so we're all on the same page, right? We bury the body, we never speak of this again. Deal. - Got it. Yup. Wow, that was exhausting. Wait a minute, is-is that-- is that his car? (car alarm wailing) Aw, crap, it's still alive! It does not feel like a Wednesday. Peter, I'm glad you're up. I need to talk to you about something. I know what you did last night. You do? How could you do something so heinous? Last night, you left your dirty dishes in the sink. It's disgusting. So I did half, and I left the other half for you. Ah, forget it. You'll just do it wrong. I'll wash 'em myself. Why don't you just go in the other room and relax? I'll call you when breakfast is ready. Okay. LOIS: Oh, my God, Peter, come look at the newspaper! ""Janitor dead."" (gasps) What? No! Right here. My college roommate, Jan Itter. She passed away yesterday. Are-are we really doin' this? 'Cause I didn't get, like, any sleep last night. What are you freaking out about? You didn't even know her. Yeah, yeah, yeah, y-you're right, you're right. LOIS: You and the guys killed and buried a man?! Ah, I knew you'd find out! Find out what? I just got David Sedaris' new book, You and the Guys Killed and Buried a Man. Okay, I am really on edge and this thing we're doin', I'm not happy about it, and that's a very odd title for a humorist's book. Peter, you're acting very weird. Just go in the other room. I don't want to go in the other room, I want to stay here and see what you're seeing, because you're saying things that I think are somethin' totally different than what they are. Peter, you're gonna have a heart attack. I won't say anything, I'll let you relax. LOIS: ""They found a body of a war hero down by the old asylum!"" Okay, that has to be something. (song playing on radio) Oh, sorry, Peter, I'm just singing along with this old John Mellencamp song.  They went up there to write a movie   Peter, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe   Killed the old janitor war hero   Just why, we'll never know  I don't remember this one. Guess it's never been in a car commercial.  In a truck that's built Dodge Tough!  Oh, yeah, no, I know this one. (whistling) Hey, Bri? Yeah? Aah! Damn it! Aah! There's glass in my eye! Oh! Son of a bitch! Aah! Mom says dinner's at 6:00. She wanted me to tell people, I don't know why. (groaning) Guys, I'm kind of freaking out about killing that guy. Anybody else have a hard time sleeping? No, but there's an old John Mellencamp song you're not gonna (bleep) believe. Wait, w-what's all this stuff about you guys killing someone? Last night, at the asylum. We killed that war hero. Whoa, whoa, what?! You-you really killed someone? Holy moly, I don't think I want to hear this. Quagmire, you were there with us. You're so weird. Last night, I was in St. Louis. I even have a picture. See that? That's yesterday's date on that newspaper. On The Quahog Informant? They sell The Quahog Informant in St. Louis? Well, probably, but good luck with that whole ""you three and not me killed a guy"" thing. Damn it, that bastard is bailing on us. He's a worse accomplice than Johnny Wind Chimes. (chimes chiming) Hey! Shh! (loudly): Sorry! It's my chimes. I hate to frame you like this, Quagmire, but I gotta. I can't go to jail! They'll razz me good on account of my belly. Cleveland? What are you doing here? What are you both doing here? Joe? What the hell? QUAGMIRE: You backstabbers. What the hell's going on? I'll tell you what's going on. Cleveland's tryin' to frame me. He's got my miniature portraits of cool guys. Peter, those are baseball cards. Whatever. He's using it to frame me for murder! Well, I'm not the only one. Joe's got my Sports Illustrated football phone. He was using this as his main phone. It is a mess over there. Look at all you pathetic people, bringing stuff to frame each other. You're supposed to be friends. Hey, that's my shovel! Damn right! That's how smart I am, I only had to bring one thing! This way I can dig the hole and just throw this in! But once you throw it in there, how you gonna get the dirt back on top? Give me your shovel! You're gonna have to kill me first! Not with my shovel! That's brand-new! Give me back my rattle-y plastic phone!   Wait, wait, wait, guys! Guys! What? Don't you see? This! This is our horror movie! (thunder crashes)   It doesn't feel like a Wednesday. Boy, that sucked. Yeah, I guess writing a movie isn't as easy as Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes it look. Hey, at least we gave it a shot. I just feel bad we killed an innocent man. Well, don't feel too bad. Look at that! Oh, my God! Wow, that's a relief! We may have actually made this town a better place. Yeah, what a monster. But at least now he's gone forever."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  ANNOUNCER: Hey, guys, do you like beer, but can't get drunk from beer? Then try new Vodka Beer. The can says ""beer,"" but inside is 12 ounces of carbonated vodka. And the best part is, your wife will never know. Honey, I'm so proud of you, cutting down to one beer a night. (slurring): Take off your underwear. She don't know. I got the mail. Hey, does an octopus live here? Peter, that says ""occupant."" Oh, that's too bad. That would've been awesome. Oh look, Peter. Here's something from your mother's estate. Oh, looks like they finally sold her house. And the last white domino in that neighborhood falls. Wow, they sold it? So that means the house and everything inside of it is gone? Oh, sweetheart. You thinking about all the good times you had there? No, I'm thinking about my teenage porn stash. It's still hidden in the house. Oh, okay, but I know this is really about the memories. Lactating sluts on box springs. The-The-The special times growing up Bikini black chicks sneezing. Lois, stop making him reminisce about stuff. You don't understand, Lois. A boy's first collection of nudie books and girlie movies is a sacred thing. It can't fall into a stranger's hands. This is very serious. I'm taking us to DEFCON 4. (sign buzzes) What happens when it hits DEFCON 1? We see a dog wearing a wig. Aw, heck, let's see that anyway. (Peter chuckles) That's not even a lady dog. Hey, Peter, what's wrong? You've been real quiet. I don't know, Quagmire. I keep thinking of my old pornos. It's like I'm reminded of them everywhere I look. You've been looking at Cleveland a lot. Plus, you know, when people find that box, they won't know that, like, for some of them magazines, I just had them as, like, a joke. You know, not 'cause, like, I was really into it. Just the opposite. For some of them magazines. Okay. I'm going to be arrested for sure. Peter, I know exactly where you're coming from. You, Quagmire? You enjoy pornography, too? Yup, and I know that a man's porn collection must be secured and protected at all costs, until he gets ashamed of it and ditches it in an alley behind a Kroger's. Hey, I know! What if we break into my old house and steal back my big box of pornos? What do you say? You guys with me? You bet. Sure thing, Peter. I mean, come on, we're a team. Like fish and chips and fat guys. I want the double cheeseburger, but I'm gonna go healthy and get the fish and chips. ANNOUNCER: Fish and chips! (singing jauntily): Okay, you all remember the plan-- we walk up wearing our Bill Cosby masks Peter, that's President Obama. Aw, did I just do a racism? (knocking on window) Hello? Can I help you gentlemen? Hi. You guys have been sitting in front of my house for the last five hours trying on Obama masks. Is there something I can do for you? We, uh we-we were just getting ready to break into your house. Excuse me? Oh, hey, cool shirt. What? Oh, thank you. Look, what's this all about? This guy used to live in your house and a box of his old porn is still hidden in there. We were gonna break in and take it. And I was gonna stay with the rental van because it's my name what's on the contract. Oh. Well, you could've just knocked on the door and asked. I don't want that stuff, I've got kids. Get it out of there! Really? Awesome! Oh, well that was easier than a game of Pai Gow poker. Pai gow. You lose again! That was awesome! I can't believe these tables are always empty. You play again? Nope, out of money. I'm just gonna wait for my drink. Who had the full glass of Goldschlager? Ah. Sorry, can't tip. I'm gonna take this up to my room. Oh, I'm on the wrong floor. (vacuum whirring) Almost time for lunch. Ah How was everything? Delicious. The prime rib was mostly fat. Should I charge it to your room? No, I had to check out, even though my flight's not until midnight. Now, how does one with no money get to the airport? (horn honking) (honking) Hey, buddy, you're blocking the outlet. Oh, sorry. There was no chairs. Hi, Peter. How was Vegas? Oh, it's the best. Sweet. Now, which movie should I start with? ""Back-Door Sluts 4."" Eh, I haven't seen the first three, I wouldn't know what's going on. Here we go. I want to watch all of these movies, nonstop. I don't want to watch any more of these movies, ever. Hey, Brian, you want to go for a ride to behind the Kroger's? What? That's weird. What's that? Hello, Future Peter. Hi. By the time you watch this, you'll be grown-up, so I'm sure you're allowed to eat ice cream and pizza for every meal. You know it. Also, I bet you're a big important doctor like that Doogie Howser kid who's getting so much ass. Well, I was partly right. I just hope to God you're not stuck in some loser job, like in a brewery, or a toy factory, or a fishing boat. Oh, boy. But, you know, I don't have to worry about none of that. I'm sure you're a big, successful doctor. Anyway, here's some Conway Twitty.  I know it's only make believe  This is annoying. I don't want to sit through this. Man, I guess I ain't the big success I thought I'd be. I know what you mean, Peter. When I was young, I thought that someday I'd produce upworthy web content. Am I doing it? Yes. But not everyone is so lucky. (sighs) Damn it, I suck. I've never done anything important. Well, except for when I beat Larry Bird for a Big Mac. Off the floor, off the scoreboard, off the backboard, no rim.   Right near the basket, underhanded, effeminate gasp, over the backboard, out of bounds, waddle over to get it, slip on a towel, twist my ankle, go to the emergency room, doctors tell me it's not that bad and I shouldn't have come there, I make them give me a cast anyway, never play sports again. Hey, I won the two-dollar sandwich.  Highway to the danger zone  Look at me. I was beautiful. What are you watching? It's just a teenage loser who didn't realize he had no future in front of him. Well, when you're done with this, Stewie is trapped between his crib and the wall. STEWIE: Help. Somebody help! He's watching an old video. STEWIE: Okay, when he's done then.  Gonna take you right into the danger zone  Oh, my God! He's just rhyming ""danger zone"" with ""danger zone."" Holy crap! Chris, I was just like you! What? Listen to me, Chris. I'm a failure in life, and that's all I'll ever be. But it's not too late for you. I won't let you go down my path. What are you saying, Dad? I'm saying, Chris, I am going to make sure that you grow up to be a success. Yeah, I'm going to be a success! Uh, would you excuse me for a moment? Computer, what does ""success"" mean? Chris, let me know when you're done with the computer. Whoa, whoa, whoa! No TV for you, Chris. TV is how stupid losers spend their time. Peter, what is this all about? I'm trying to save our son, Lois. I don't want him to end up like me-- dead-end job, crappy house, aging wife who's getting skinny where fat's supposed to be, and fat where skinny's supposed to be. Ha! Meg, go to your room. Look, Peter, I'm glad you're thinking about Chris' future, but he's fine. He's a perfectly normal kid. Are you crazy? Look at him. He's over there intentionally giving himself a nosebleed. Yay! My nose is finally a woman! Okay, so maybe he's a little rough around the edges, but-- Oh, boy, a little got in my mouth there. Yeah, I'm gonna have to wash this shirt. Anyway, I'm going to help Chris become a big, important success. The same way Mumford turned his son into a success. Okay, Dad, heading out to the concert. Now, hold on a minute, son. Where are your arm garters? Your string tie? Your woolen vest? You look nothing like a dry goods clerk from the Garfield administration. But, Dad No buts! You're a Mumford. Now get upstairs, put on a jaunty travelling hat, and write the same song Okay, now, Chris, if you want to be a success, you gotta look worldly and sophisticated. And to do that, you got to dress like Lenny Kravitz, with little something from every part of he world pinned on you. Leather bracelets! Nipple ring! Zippers where zippers shouldn't be! Wilma Flintstone pearl necklaces! A fur shrug with crocheted sleeves! A hat on a hat! A watch on your pinky toe! And nothing says, ""Look at me, I've been places"" like two lit road flares hanging from your sunglasses. Hey, you look like you've been places. Stop looking at me! I do not want this attention! Come on, Chris, let's get out of here. Uh, what are you doing? Well, I been trying to make Chris less of a fat dummy, and nothing seems to be working, so now we're high-stepping around in giant hats. Tip of the giant hat, sir. And to you, sir! Yes, sir, smart day to you, sir. And I thank you, sir. (yelps) (cries) I scraped my knee bad! Get up, Chris, you're embarrassing yourself. You look stupid and fat. Peter, I have to ask-- are you pushing Chris so hard because it's what's best for him? Or are you trying to make up or your own disappointment about how your life turned out? Brian, these are the biggest hats I could find, so if your point is that there's even larger ones available, I would greet that with skepticism. No, no, no, my point is that you need to let Chris find his own path. (gasps) Oh, my God, you're right, Brian. He needs to be pointed to a very specific path. And then forced to go down it. No, no, that's-that's the opposite of what I just said. Chris, your best chance for success is to be cultured and worldly, like our dog. So starting right now, you gotta follow Brian around and do everything he does. What?! Come on, Brian. You gotta show Chris how to turn out better than me. I mean, you went to Brown, you're a published author, you can hear it first when Joe falls out of the tub. That's starting to happen more often. But I guess you're right. Maybe I am the guy to make a diamond out of this lump of coal. But only if it's what Chris wants. I don't care. All right, I'll do it. Just follow my lead, Chris. 'Cause I think you could be something great. Who knows? Maybe you'll even become one of those mission control leaders who gets all thoughtful while everybody's celebrating. Apollo 13, this is Mission Control, do you copy? Apollo 13, this is mission control, do you copy? Do you copy, Apollo 13? (static hissing) Mission Control, this is Apollo 13. We're all okay. Good to be home. (cheering) (sighs) Sir, you did it! Sir, is everything okay? Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader a couple of years ago and I'm still pissed about it.         Hey. Hey. Chew that way. Eh, dinner's no fun without Chris here. There's nobody here for me to wing my biscuit at. Well, Peter, he's been spending an awful lot of time with Bri-- Eh, it's not the same. Anyway, he and Brian have been spending a lot of time together. Really? You're going to let that slide? Guy throws a biscuit at you? Good evening, all. Apologies for being so tardy. Aw, Chris, you're not tardy. We tested you twice. There you guys are. We were wondering about you. Brian and I have been having a blast. First we went to a symphony. Then we saw a small independent play with real smoking in it. And then we hit the Quahog Book Festival and went to a Q and A to ask questions that weren't really questions. Wow, look at my sophisticated young man. You're certainly taking to Brian's example. If anything, he's teaching me. I mean, not really, but you-you know. Aw, see, I knew Brian could put Chris on the path to success. Hey, Chris, let's celebrate. There's a new baby panda at the zoo. How about you and me go chuck tater tots at it? Chuck them at Lois. She'll just sit there and take it. (chuckling): Oh, Dad. That would've been fine for the old me, but Brian and I have to be going. Oh. Okay. Yeah, we're off to see an old movie on temporary screen in a muddy, freezing park. That sounds awful. (chuckling): It is awful. But at least parking will be impossible. Bye! Geez, I feel like I just lost my son. Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack and it stings when I don't wipe right. This has been a bad dinner. There you two are. Sit down and join us. I can't stay, Mom. Brian's showing me all of his favorite stuff to do. Getting spooked when the furnace goes on? We're participating in an autism walk. Looks like you're doing it right now. And we may be gone a while, 'cause after that we're going down to the Civic Center. Michael Ian Black is cocking his eyebrows for four hours. Ha! He says the things we don't care to say. Bye! Man, I'm sick of how much time Chris is spending with Brian. Probably smooching pickles, 'cause they're a couple of pickle smoochers. It's like he ain't even my son no more, doing all that fancy-pants stuff. Oh, Peter, I know you miss him, but this is what you wanted, isn't it? Well, yeah, but I didn't realize bettering himself meant blowing off his old man. You know what? The hell with this. I want my son back. Peter, relax. Chris is just going through a phase. He'll grow out of it. Just like you grew out of your ""Walk Like An Egyptian"" phase. Paul was a good man. A good friend. I'll I'll always remember how supportive he was when I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't-I can't- I can't do this. Check it out, Lois-- when Chris notices that ""World's Greatest Son"" mug I made, he'll be back on board with his old man in no time. Hey, Chris, what's on the mug? ""World's Greatest Sun."" This world only has one sun. What kind of idiot made this mug?  When everything's made to be broken  (crying)  I just want you to know who I am.  (Pharrell William's ""Happy"" begins)  It might seems crazy what I'm about to say  I'm very easily influenced by music. All right, Chris, now I know you're all sophisticated now, but no man can resist the siren call of mentally impaired supermodel Kate Upton. Mm, sorry, Dad. I'm more of a Catherine Keener man now. But, Chris, you got to take advantage. The clock's ticking on Kate Upton. She's almost at the end of her window. (timer dings) Yup, we missed it. Come on, get out of here. (grunting) Sorry, Lois, I need the TV. I gotta win my son back. What are you talking about, Peter? Well, you know how Brian's got Chris watching all them fancy foreign films now? Well, I figure I can lure Chris in with this French movie-- Le RocquÃ© Trois. (accordion plays Rocky theme with French lilt) ADRIENNE (French accent): RocquÃ©! ROCKY (French accent): Adrienne! RocquÃ©! Adrienne! MAN (French accent): J'pitÃ© Le fool. ROCKY: Oh, Clubbert Lange! Peter, this is pointless. You wanted Chris to be a better person with a bright future, and thanks to Brian, that's what he has now. Yeah, but, I don't even recognize Chris these days. And I never get to spend time with him. It's like Chris ain't my friend no more. Thanks for coming to the book club meeting, everyone. Well, I gotta say, I loved this week's book-- Annie Proulx's The Shipping News. Yes, yes! Yes. Very Portnoy's Complaint. Uh, I don't What, uh, what do you mean by that? Oh, you know, just with the-the port, and the shipping. And of course, in Portnoy's Complaint you've got the guy who's living near the water That doesn't sound right. and he hated the noise from the local port, so he filed one of the very first port noise complaints in maritime law. And for those of us who read the complaints, trust me, they were very warranted. Brian, could I talk to you over here? Oh, let's dog-ear this for a sec. (chuckles) This one gets it. Brian, what the hell are you talking about? You clearly haven't read either of those books. Whoa, Chris, now you're starting to sound like Mark Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens. Oh, that is so your go-to! I can't believe you. I thought you were this worldly, sophisticated guy, but you're just a fraud-- like Moses. And the Lord's Eleventh Commandment-- ""Moses gets to be first in line at the buffet."" What?! Oh, seriously? I know, you guys, it's so lame, but that's what it says. Why are you doing that? Why are you hucking tater tots at a baby panda? 'Cause I'm oddly attracted to him and it frightens me. See, this is why you're so great, Dad. You don't pretend to be someone you're not. You do what you want, and you don't care what anyone thinks. Well, I-I care what you think. Look, Chris, you're my kid, and I want what's best for you, but I guess I just don't want you to become too good for your old man. Don't worry, Dad. I could never be too good for you because you're the best. And I want to be just like you when I grow up. Really? Aw, thanks, Chris. Tater tot? It's fun, right? Yeah! And the mama panda doesn't do anything about it, because she was blinded to make her more submissive. Ha-ha! You're right. You know, Chris, all this started 'cause I was feeling bad about being a failure. But you know what? I got you for a son. So maybe I did something right. I love you, Dad. Come on, Chris. Let's go get an $18 Coke at the terrible zoo restaurant. Yay! Sticky tables covered in bees! Coming up, we'll tell you where to look when talking to a coworker in the bathroom. The answer might surprise you. Well, I think we all learned something today. In other news, TVs still make noise, even when people resume their conversations. Yes, studies have determined That's right, Peter. And it's the most important lesson. (Tom continues) Everyone should be who they are. Success is being true to yourself. Amen, Mom. (Tom continues) But to have the love of your family, that's true success. Let's go ahead and turn off the TV. TOM: There we go."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Hey. What are you working on? Oh, just trying to make some sense of these numbers. (women moaning, giggling) What the What did you hit? What happened to my spreadsheet? What exactly was the endgame if I hadn't walked in? Ugh, there's nothing worse than grocery shopping on the day before Thanksgiving. (turkey thuds) Yeah, that's the sound a rich family's turkey makes. There's still a lot more groceries in the car. Well, it's not a race. Take a break. Ugh, if you knew how close we were to putting you down last year. Geez, what's her problem? Eh, Thanksgiving's exhausting. You know what she could use? A little sip of that drink I invented. Hi! Stewie Griffin here with my latest creation: Monster Energy Drink. What is it? I don't know, but it's free from this truck that stopped outside your work. Mix it with booze. Ever been wide-awake-blacked-out? Ever try to jump over a train on a bike? Ever bit the beak off a bird? Monster Energy: put it in your body and ask questions later. It's green, so it's nature. TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to Guy Friends. So, you must be pretty pumped. For what? Oh. Olympics. Oh, yeah. I guess that's starting soon. I thought you were a big Olympics guy. Yeah, I like 'em okay. Huh.  Guy friends   A computer made us roommates in college   That's why we're friends   Guy friends!  Mail's here. Any fliers of Hispanic women running for city council? Yeah, there is. Thank you. Peter, you got a letter from your sister Karen. What? You've got a sister, Dad? How come we've never met her? Is she a prim and proper aunt (""ONT"") or a big, fat, dirty aunt (""ANT"")? I have no obligation to tell any of you anything. Mr. Griffin has shown good faith in appearing here today and will not be subjected to this sort of hostile interrogation. Your father doesn't like to talk about his sister, Meg. They've never really gotten along. Wow, Peter. In all the years I've known you, you've never even mentioned a sister. Big deal, I don't talk about my sister. I also don't talk about that tickling uncle. All right, Uncle Dan, remember: no tickling. (chuckles) You got it. (laughing) You didn't say anything about Uncle Neil. Whose uncles are you? It says here your sister's coming for Thanksgiving. She what? CHRIS: If we're having guests, can I invite Rosario Vargas from the third district, a leader you can depend on? I don't want Karen here. Peter, you've been avoiding your sister for too long. Besides, she says she's been having Thanksgiving with your mother for the last 20 years. And now that your mom has passed, she'd like to spend Thanksgiving with you. (whispering) No. Peter, Karen's coming and that's that. How cool! I didn't even know I had an aunt. I can't wait to meet her. Look, I'm telling you guys, it's gonna be a disaster. Just like the alternate ending of Back to the Future.   Well, if I'm gonna disappear into nothing, I might as well bang my mom. Hey, Lorraine, wait up! Hi! My name's Marty! I'm in a picture!   To be contondered! TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to The Cosby Show, knowing what we know now. (The Cosby Show theme playing) Huh. I was so busy not seeing color, I didn't see the raping, either. Okay, everyone. It'll be another hour before the turkey's done, but I made more appetizers. Ooh, grape jelly on a Triscuit. You're a whiz. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Save your appetite. And don't think I haven't noticed you've already had two drinks. You're, like, all the worst parts of a girlfriend. (doorbell rings) Oh. That must be Karen. I'll get it. Aunt Karen? And you must be Meg. Do that to me! (giggling) Wow, it's so cool that I've got an aunt I didn't know about. Oh, Karen, I'm so happy you could make it. Lois Pewterschmidt. The one that got away. I'm just joshing, kid. Auntie's not a biscuit-bumper. (laughter) (laughs) I'm not, either! (laughs) Peter, come say hello to your sister. (sighs) Fine. Hey, Karen. Welcome to our Bring it in, Pee Pee! (farts) (laughter) I like her. Hello. I am City Councilwoman Rosario Vargas. Quahog doesn't work if it doesn't work for all of us. That's a beautiful pantsuit, Ms. Vargas. Wow, Karen, nice to meet you. I'm Glenn Quagmire. I didn't know Peter even had a sister. What are you, ashamed of me, Chin Nuts? Oh, my God. His chin kind of does look like nuts. Ha, ha! I never noticed that. How could you not notice it? Watch this, I-I'll punch him in the nuts. Eh, sort of clever. Wait a second. I know you. You're that lady wrestler. Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's right. Hey, w-what do they call you again? Heavy Flo. You're Heavy Flo! In the flesh and blood. Gross. Man, you're amazing. I remember when you called out Andrea the Giant the day after September 11. What just happened was a national tragedy, but it's nothing compared to what I'm gonna do to Andrea the Giant! We will never forget what happened yesterday, but you'll also never forget what's gonna happen September 17 at the Jack Witschi Sports Arena! Peter, I can't believe you've kept your sister a secret. She's amazing! Yeah, she's crazy strong. Like Superman on a date. Yeah, I wasn't here, but I heard her scream, so I came flying in and found her like this. It's weird. Same cause of death as those three guys in that local public bathroom. Unsolvable. Now do you see why I didn't want Karen here, Lois? She terrorized me my whole childhood. Now she's got to embarrass me in front of my friends? Peter, Bonnie just changed Joe on the table. What are you worried about? Still, I don't want to go back out there. Look, I know you've had your differences, but Karen's your sister. And you're grown-ups now. Can't you just go out there and pretend to have a good time? Fine, I'll play along. I guess I've lied before. Where you going? Home. Where's home? The White House. Okay, I'm here. This is my house. You can go now. Thanks for taking me home. Go ahead, go inside. I will. You can drive away now. No, no, I-I want to make sure you get inside safe. Yeah, but I-I got to look through the mail first. You know how it is. Really, I insist. I-It's totally okay. Go. At this point, it's more about me than it is you. It's a bad neighborhood. If I don't see you go inside, I'll be thinking about it all night. (sighs) (whispering) Uh come on in, Mr. President! (laughter) And then, so I'm like, ""Peter, how was I supposed to know you didn't want your teammates to know you wore a bra?"" (laughter) It was a custom-designed sports halter top. More stories! More stories! Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop or maybe a Silly Billy. (laughs) Oh, man. Okay, let's just carve the turkey. Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it. She did? But that's my thing. I always do my ""are you a leg man or a breast man"" joke. Aunt Karen did that, too. It was hilarious. I never really got it until she said it. Ha, ha! Hey, Karen, later you got to show us some of your wrestling holds. Yeah, what's that trademark finishing move of yours? The Toxic Shock. Oh, yeah, that move is badass! You're awesome. Know what else is awesome? This stuffing. Thank you, Glenn. You're welcome. I'm in a good mood. Sure, what the hell, I'll show you my moves. Maybe after dinner. No, no, no. The family football game is after dinner. We do it every year! Peter, calm down. You're making a scene. It's not my fault, Lois. She's ruining Thanksgiving! The way Tim Burton ruined the Fourth of July!  Spooky! Happy! Spooky! Happy!   Weirdness! Weirdness!   Spooky! Happy!   La, la, la!   Weirdness, weirdness   Patriotic weirdness   Barbecuing human heads   Every president is dead   Everybody's gonna die   Have a dark and dead July!  (yowls) Fat chicks with black hair get tattoos of me! God, I love this time of year. It's just past all the amazing colors of fall, and before the white of winter. Just brown and gray. Magical. All right, let's do this. All right, listen up, I'm the captain. The teams are chosen by a lottery system where Aunt Karen, can I be on your team? Yeah, yeah, me, too! Uh, yeah, sure, I'll take, uh, Meg, Skinny, Hot Chocolate and The Bus. Pee Pee, you get the crumbs. Let's go. All right, let's do it, Pop! I'm gonna make some sports points for you! We'll kick off. Hey, time-out! Did anyone tape the parade? Please tell me someone taped the parade! (grunts) (sighs) (groaning) Oh, my God! She's doing The Toxic Shock! (groaning) (gasping, wheezing) Y-Y-You're a j-jerk, K-K-Karen! What the hell was that? That's his stutter. And whenever he stutters, he usually pees his pants. N-No, I d-d-don't. (groans): Oh. So this is football. I like it. Hi, Dad. Look, I-I just want you to know, I feel bad about what happened with you and Aunt Karen the other day. Oh, you mean when she put me in that no-bottom James Bond chair and assaulted my grundle? I didn't even know about that. Well, that's 'cause it didn't happen. I'd kick her ass if she tried something like that! Dad, stop. Even I can see that your sister's a huge bully. And trust me, I know more about getting bullied than anyone. You do? How?  Celebrate good times, come on   Let's celebrate   Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh   Celebrate good times, come on.  Man, I love that song. Dad, what I'm trying to tell you is, I now see why you've been so tough on me all these years. 'Cause it makes my friends laugh? No, because that's how Aunt Karen treated you when you were a kid. (gasps loudly) That's right. And that's why you need to confront Karen. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, I can't do that. I tried for years to stand up to her. Nothing ever worked. What, so now you're gonna quit? You can't quit. What if Muhammad Ali had quit? Ah, my grandchildren! Who would like me to read them a book, or maybe paint their name on a grain of rice? Honey, dinnertime! Ah, my favorite. Hot soup. Right in there. Dad, I know you can stand up to Aunt Karen. And maybe if you finally do, she'll stop terrorizing you, and you won't have to take it out on me for the rest of my life. You know what, Meg? You're right! I'm gonna do it! You are? Damn right! Yay, Dad! I am gonna become a lady wrestler and defeat Heavy Flo in the ring. Wait. What?! No! What?! I meant go talk to her. Nope, it's got to be a lady wrestling match. Hey, Meg, Thanksgiving's over. Come help me with the Christmas decorations. Meg! Help me with the Christmas decorations! Comments? Questions? What the hell are you I'm sorry. Chris had his hand up first. Chris? What's the capital of Maryland? I do not know, but that's a very good question. Now, Lois? Peter, what the hell are you doing?! First, it's not Peter. When I am in this outfit, I am Maxi Paddy, the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo. Peter, you look-- okay, that's clever-- but, Peter, you look ridiculous. Take that off. If you want to settle things with your sister, just go talk to her. No, Lois, the only way to settle a family dispute is in the cage. I mean, you don't understand. Karen made me feel worse than a guy getting cut from a baseball team. You wanted to see me, Coach? I'm sorry, Kyle. You can't do this boring, stupid thing with us. All right, Peter, your sister's the real deal. So I arranged for you to get some combat pointers from my old buddy, Steven Seagal. Uh, this this fat guy? Yup. Go on, ask him anything. How how did? Uh, why-why you so fat? Okay, ask him about anything but his weight. (sighs): Uh uh, you act Asian, you look Native American, your name is possibly Jewish. What are you? He fat. All right, Peter, most professional wrestlers become addicted to painkillers at some point. So I figure, why don't we just start now? Uh okay, yeah, I'm in. Where you getting all these? Stepdaughter's purse. Ain't my problem. Man, I love putting my hand down my pants when I'm on drugs. We should just go live on a boat in some guy's backyard. So, you gonna do that wrestling stuff? Nah, I'm gonna stick with these. I would crime for more of these. Okay, now if you're gonna defeat your sister in the ring, you got to get to the root of your fears. We got to go back to your childhood, so I'm gonna hypnotize you. Okay, go back. Now, we need to go back in time. (high-pitched voice): My jeans are husky. Okay, further. Further. Little further. Now, open your eyes and tell me what you see. (demonic voice): I see the six stations of the Lord's order, and they will all burn! Okay, too far! Too far! Too far! Come back. Come back. Come back. (high-pitched voice): Hey, can I make my husky jeans into cutoffs for swimming? Ah, forget it. You're ready. Yeah, Peter. I think you're gonna win! All right! Hey, thanks for all your help, you guys. You know, there's only two things I've wanted to do my whole life: put my sister in her place and go to Chico's Monkey Farm.    Chico's Monkey Farm   Come and have a howling good time   Ooh-ooh, aah-aah, ooh-ooh, aah-aah   Chico's Monkey Farm   The only drive-through monkey farm   In Northern Southern Rhode Island   Ooh, aah!   Chico's Monkey Farm   After a prolonged litigation, we're finally open again   Ooh, aah!   Chico's Monkey Farm   There's a fair amount of paperwork   Before you get to see a monkey so allow for extra time   Ooh, aah!   Chico's Monkey Farm   Keep your windows rolled up 'cause the monkeys   Will pry 'em open and they're known to strangle kids   Ooh-ooh-ooh, aah-aah-aah!  ANNOUNCER: Chico's Monkey Farm! Now open pending how it goes. (crowd cheering) (grunting) And we've got quite a match tonight between Heavy Flo and another woman whose name I've forgotten but I'm sure is a gross pun. Right you are, Bill. Tonight, she's up against Her Vajesty's Secret Cervix. Interesting fact: these two gals have over eight meters of ass crack between them. One! Two! Three! (crowd cheering) It's over! And once again, a Heavy Flo has ruined another lady's evening! (cheering continues) PETER: You ain't no champ! Not till you go through me! Who the hell are you?! I'm Maxi Paddy, which is short for Maxine Patricia. I was named after my father, Maxwell Patrick. But that's enough about me. I'm here to kick your ass! Get out of here! I'm not fighting some fat loser from the crowd. Huh. It looks like this Heavy Flo is pee, because you're yellow! CROWD: Oh! Well, that didn't quite track, but the crowd seems to be on board. It sure does! Looks like Heavy Flo has a challenger! All right, get up here, but make it quick. I got a Lampoon reunion to get to. Heavy Flo, always finding a way to drop her Harvard degree into conversation. Yes, very off-putting, Bill. Those of us who went to Harvard really don't appreciate it. (bell dings) (grunting) Ow! Damn it, Karen! Karen? Peter, is that you? What are you doing here? Something I should have done a long time ago. I'm tired of you bullying me! You're going down! VENDOR: Butt-scratcher?! Butt-scratcher!   (grunting) D-D-D-Don't, K-K-Karen! CROWD (chanting): Toxic Shock! Toxic Shock! Oh, my God, she's taking it too far! Heavy Flo is gonna break this girl's arms! Woman's arms. Come on, Bill. N-N-No! Tell Stewie he's in charge of the show now. Say hello to Teen LaQueefa! One! Two! Three! (crowd cheering) I don't believe it! Heavy Flo is down, and we have a new champion! I tell you, this is one for the books, if anyone kept track of this nonsense! Wow, you really saved me! Thanks, stranger. Dad, it's me. (gasps) Meg? It was you who saved me? That's right, Dad. Wow, even after all the crummy stuff I've done to you? But why? Because you're my dad. And I couldn't stand by and watch you get hurt. Wow. Thanks, Meg. You know, that's something even my own mom and dad never did for me. They just stood by and let Karen pick on me. Well, you deserve better. We all do. You know, Meg, I'm really sorry I treated you so badly over the years. I guess I was taking out all the pain I felt on you. I understand. Better than anybody. But I still love you, Dad. I love you, too, Meg. Did somebody order a hot-ass bitch and this lady? Oh, you're alive. Sorry, I was told I was in charge now. Well, if you die, this is kind of the creative direction I'm leaning toward. Well, I'm proud of you, Dad. You finally stood up for yourself. So, Peter, have you talked to Karen? I called, like, four times, but she's not out of the coma yet. Apparently, they usually use fake chairs, but Meg used a real one. Do they think she's gonna survive? It could go either way. (phone ringing) Hello? No, I think I'm a different blood type. No, I don't want to check. Doctor says there's nothing they can do."

                    			It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!  Ah, Smitty's Steakhouse. You know, this was the fanciest restaurant in Quahog when I was a kid. The ladies' room has a big space with chairs in it, like a living room, before you get back to where the crappers are. Good evening and welcome to Smitty's. I'll be back with martinis for Mom and Dad, and for you kids, some martinis. Dad, can you pass the bread? Sure. But don't forget the butter that looks like decorative bathroom soaps and is impossible to smear. Thanks, Dad! This really ruins it! What will you be having, sir? Yes, I'll have what I had last time: pheasant on the glass. Don't you mean ""pheasant under glass""? Nope. (chirping) Yeah. Now turn around and lay an egg on the glass. Aw, yeah. I defy you to tell me exactly what's wrong with this. Oh, Peter, look. You can put your business card in this bowl and maybe win a free lunch. I don't have a business card. And I think you knew that. I hope you enjoyed your meal, sir. May I offer you a toothpick? Oh, I-I don't know. We've already spent a lot of money in here tonight. No, sir, it-it's free. Oh! Peter, that's not how you use a toothpick. You pick your teeth with it. I cannot believe I have to explain this to you. There are gaps in my knowledge. This is hardly news. Wow, this is awesome! This is like I'm having a whole second meal! Man, this just feels right. That's it. From here on out, I am about all things toothpick. I'm gonna go everywhere with it, always be chewin' on it, #-and start all my sentences with, ""All right, here's what you're gonna do."" Excuse me, we're from out of town. Where do people go to listen to live music around here? I'll handle this. All right, here's what you're gonna do: skip the live music. Get yourself a room over at the Wickford Marina. Take her out on a balcony, point to any boat in the harbor, and tell her it's yours. Now, you got rubbers? Now that I'm a toothpick guy, I call 'em rubbers. Or you could just pull the hose out of the bucket and let it spray free. I've had a vasectomy. Chris, now that I'm a toothpick guy, it's my job to sit on a BMX bike outside the rec center and ask every kid if they're the new kid. Hey. You the new kid? Why? Never mind why. Got any cool toys? Uh, I got an Xbox. How about you? I got a Barbie with a wiener on it. Took a thumb from a G.I. Joe, put it on with superglue. Looks pretty real. Real enough, anyways. Does the job. Does what job? You get it. My family moves around a lot 'cause I do stuff like this. Um okay. I got to go now. You sure you don't want to come over and pull on my cat's nipples? We can do anything, 'cause my mom has two jobs. All right, I'm off to the fish market. What? Why? Well, the most intimidating people are toothpick guys who work at seafood counters and make people uncomfortable for not knowing about fish. What's good here? It's all good. What's the freshest? It's all fresh. How 'bout the halibut? Is it gamey? Gamey? I mean, you know, is it fishy? It's all fish. Is there a special way to prepare it? I'd cook it up. W-Well, what's the best fish here? What's your favorite fish? I don't eat fish. I only like spaghetti. Ugh, when are you gonna get rid of that toothpick? It's disgusting, and it's starting to smell. Why would I give it up? It's gettin' me tons of tail. What? And check this out. The rare triple toothpick flip. (choking) Oh, my God, are you all right? (coughs) No, I swallowed it! My toothpick! It's gone! Damn it! I'm gonna need you to put that large two-handed colander over the toilet. Peter, that was a wedding present from my aunt. Well, let's use the ice cream maker! We've never used it once! Calm down. You can always get another toothpick. Oh, my God, you're right! Lois, we got to drive to Smitty's right now and get one. Now? But we told Chris we'd be there when he wakes up from surgery. All right, we were able to fix your hernia, but you've got to stop lifting sewer hole covers. But the Ninja Turtles live down there. I'm friends with them. Hey, fat ass, I brought you flowers. But stay out of the sewers! We're trying to work down there. Thanks, Donatello! (tires screech) Oh, thank God! Quick, we need another toothpick! Thank you, Maurice. Just get your toothpick and let's get out of here. Ugh. No, thanks. That old lady has ruined toothpicks for me. Just like how Meg ruined broccoli. Hey, Meg, look, they're little trees! No, they're not. They're not?! Hey, Peter! Oh, look, there's Quagmire and his transgendered mother, which is now great. Hey, Quagmire. Hey, Ida. I didn't know you liked Smitty's. Oh, yeah, I've been coming here for ages. They even named a sandwich after me. It's an inside-out hot dog slathered in ketchup. Please, please join us. Oh, we wouldn't want to interrupt your brave dinner. Nonsense, we're happy to have you. All right, but we already ate dinner, so maybe just an iceberg wedge, a steak, and some sides. And then I said something random that suggested a whole crazy story! (all laugh) Oh, God, that's hilarious, Lois. I could listen to you talk all night. Yeah, but we got to get going. Carter's our babysitter, and if he's with the kids too long, they start sayin' racisms. Aw, I wish the fun didn't have to end. I always enjoy spending time with you two. Well, why don't you come over tomorrow? We'll fire up the grill and have the gang over for a cookout. Well, that sounds wonderful. Well, great, we'll be there! Hey, before you two leave, let's take a photo. Yeah! Selfie! (laughs) I just learned that word. Perfect! Well, good night, you guys. See you tomorrow, hashtags! You're not doin' that right. Boy, that Lois is really something, isn't she? Yeah. Peter's a lucky guy. Glenn, do you do you have feelings for her? What? (scoffs) No. A mother always knows. You like to play the field, but, deep down, you really wish you had a woman like Lois, don't you? No, I don't want a woman like Lois. I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. She's warm and kind and beautiful. I've never been so in love with anyone. Glenn, that's very sweet, but you're talking about your best friend's wife. I know, I know. It's wrong. And Peter's a good friend. Not like Cleveland. Hey, I got two of these phone books. Didn't know if you wanted one. Hey, how long have we known each other? Long time. And yet we've never discussed mothers' maiden names, the names of old pets, high school mascots, favorite teachers. Heck, I don't even know the last four digits of your Social. Cleveland, do you need to borrow some money? I do! They're gonna kill Donna! Really? No. I just want to buy a man's fur coat. Get out of here. (distant knocking) (door opens in distance) Hey, Peter, I had an extra phone book, and I PETER: I'm not buyin' you that coat! (door slams) (snores, coughing) Huh? Who? What? Yeah, what? What? Which doggy in what window? So, how'd everything go? Hard to tell. I was coughing the whole time. By the way, I couldn't figure out how to use your oven, so I destroyed it in a blind rage. Well, good night. Ooh, after that steak, I got to go lay down on the toilet. (phone vibrates) Huh. Looks like I got a couple of messages. (banging sounds on voicemail) STEWIE: Uh, Dad? Dad? Grandpa's going nuts on the oven. Can you come home quick? Who the hell is that? Huh. There's one from Quagmire. (muffled conversation) Huh, must've pocket-dialed me again. QUAGMIRE: I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. She's warm and kind and beautiful. I've never been so in love with anyone. Oh, my God. Quagmire's in love with my wife? (phone rings) Hello? LOIS: Peter, I'm having troubles on the toilet. Bring the ice cream maker. Brian, there's somethin' I got to talk to you about. Quagmire pocket-dialed me last night. You got to hear this. QUAGMIRE: I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. Oh, my God! He's in love with Lois? Yeah, and if you keep listenin', you can hear a Puerto Rican busboy get fired in the background. It's pretty funny. He cries. But can you believe Quagmire?! Well, I guess it's not that shocking. I mean, he has said 100 times that he wants to bang Lois. No, no, no, that's just Quagmire bein' a horndog. This is love. I don't know, I think you're making too big a deal out of this. Too big a deal?! The guy's been sitting next to me all these years, acting like he's my friend, when all he really wants is to be with my wife! Geez, calm down. No, I'm telling you, he's gonna try to take Lois away from me. You know what? I'm going over there right now and hit him with a shovel, like a white trash YouTube girl. Peter, wait, wait. Listen. Delete that message and pretend you never heard it. What? Why? Because you weren't meant to hear it. If you act on this, all you'll do is wreck your friendship and cause heartache for everyone involved. What, so what am I supposed to do, just ignore it? Yeah. Ignore it. Like you do with the ghost of that colonial woman who died falling down our stairs. (moaning): I saw you eat a crayon It was purple. I thought it was grape. Look, you've got to be the bigger man. You got to just keep this to yourself. (sighs) Fine, I won't say anything. Good. And don't be passive-aggressive, either. Like one of those songs in an old musical. (jaunty melody plays)  You're hideous   To be without   You're big and fat   In the heart, no doubt   You're a horrible loss   If you won't be my wife   You're a raging, continuous   Love in my life  Pretty good turnout for this thing. Oh, yeah, Mort and Neil Goldman. It's like Coachella. There's that son of a bitch! He's got some nerve showing up here. Peter, remember what we talked about. Look at them clouds up there. Yeah, that one look like Nathan. That one look like Shawn. And there go Wanya over there. How blessed are we to have all them Boyz II Men just floating around in the sky? Glenn! Ida! You made it! Hey, Lois. I brought the hamburger buns, like you wanted. I wasn't sure what people like, so I got some with seeds on them and some without. What does he mean by that, ""seeds""? Like semen? Is that what he means? Semen on her buns. Am I the only one hearing this? Get the hell away from my wife, you scumbag! Peter, what are you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about! I'm talking about this! PETER (recorded): Idea for a movie. Fop Cop. It's a cop who's, like, a fancy guy. Nobody heard that! None of you take that! What I meant to play was this. QUAGMIRE: I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. Fop Cop. That could work. Glenn i-is this true? Wait a minute, how the hell'd you get that recording, Peter? You pocket-dialed me, you bastard! Peter, that was a private conversation. That doesn't change the fact that you want to steal my wife! Hey, get your hands off me! LOIS: Oh, my God! JOE: Oh, come on, you two. MAN: Come on, man. Hey, what are y'all doing? Someone stop him! Kill him, Dad! Murder him! (Quagmire and Peter grunting) That's it! End of cookout! Get out of my house, and don't ever speak to me again! Wow, that turned ugly fast. Just like my trip to Tampa Bay. Hey, city boy, what's with the arm pants? QUAGMIRE (recorded): I want Lois. She's perfect. I've loved her for years. (groans) You're still listening to that thing? It's like, I can't even process why he'd feel this way. Maybe you know, maybe play it one more time and I can't believe this. I thought Quagmire was my friend! Peter, it's not that surprising. He's always had a potent sex drive. Remember his grandmother's funeral? (quietly): Yeah, get it in there. Oh, I wish this was about sex. If he was just home busting one to his buddy's wife, hell, we've all done that. I've heard. Allegedly. But not often. And never to Donna. Except when she wore those shiny gold shorts to parent-teacher night. Oh, yeah, that was hilarious. (laughing): Yeah, that was that was so tacky. But Quagmire actually has feelings for you. I'm afraid he might take you away from me. Peter, nobody's taking me anywhere. I love you. Mmm. I love you, too, Lois. Hey, you ever heard any of the other wives saying they're attracted to me? (laughs) No, um, not that I recall, no. Look, now that this is settled, maybe you and Glenn can put this behind you. No way! How am I supposed to be friends with someone who's in love with my wife? Quagmire is dead to me and needs to be dealt with in an appropriate manner. Shame. Shame. Shame. (bell ringing) Shame. (to ""Chain of Fools""):  Shame, shame, shame   Shame on you-hoo   Shame, shame, shame   Shame on Q  This was serious, but it turned into something fun. Glenn? Is that you? Oh, yeah, yeah. I was just buying a a grocery store cane. See you, Lois. Glenn, wait. Look, if you and Peter aren't gonna talk this out, you and I should. What's there to talk about? Everyone knows I'm in love with my best friend's wife. It's pathetic. And humiliating. Glenn I can't trust myself around you. It's probably best if I just never see you again. Well, you can't just avoid me forever. We live on the same street. Mm. Well, then I know what I have to do. Good-bye, Lois.   Oh, sour cream. You wanted me to remind you. Sour cream. Mr. Quagmire, which box do these beads go in? Let me smell 'em. They go in the big box. Quagmire, I can't believe you're moving. Look, give it time-- this whole thing will blow over. No, it's too awkward. It's best for everyone if I just leave. That's too bad. We never got to do that ""Joe-Quagmire"" lunch. Well, that'll do it. Peter, Quagmire's serious about this. You got to do something! You're right. Quagmire, wait! You almost left without this! You want me to be the one that says ""jiggety"" now? TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to Dateline. Our story tonight: The guy you think did it? He did it. Now go to bed. Your grandkids are coming tomorrow. I had a pretty good egg dish last night. What? What-what am I supposed to do with that information? Well, I don't know. Maybe ask me for the recipe? Do you have it? No. So what's going on with you guys? Nothing much. See, this is where Quagmire normally would have told one of his outrageous sex stories. Aw, we don't need him. I got a sex story for you. So I'm bangin' this chick, and she's sayin' to me, ""I'm worried that Chris won't get into college."" And then I says to her, ""Yeah, that seems like a legitimate concern."" And then I lost my wood, and so we just watched Colbert, and then I took a dump completely nude. Who else but Peter? Peter, face it-- without Quagmire, we're boring. Oh, come on, that ain't true. Yes, it is. He had all the fun ideas. Remember? He even took me parasailing. This is awesome! It's like I'm flying! (whooping) I've never felt so alive! Oh, if only I had a pair of legs. All right! (munching, gobbling) It was the fish part of me that wanted 'em! (munching, gobbling) (sighs) Look, Peter, I'm sorry Quagmire moved away, but you can't just sit around the house and drink all day. It's all your fault Quagmire fell in love with you. Traipsin' around in your tan pants and your green shirt and your soothing voice. My fault?! Yeah, everything is messed up. I lost my best friend, my buddies are all fighting, that chick at work is saying stuff that ain't true. Okay, you know what? Enough feeling sorry for yourself. We're fixing this now. Get in the car. What? Why? You'll see. Why should I trust you? You're always trickin' me into going places I don't want to. Oh you said we were going to a place Walt Disney built. No, Peter. I said supported. (bright fanfare playing) LOIS: By the way, don't go on the train ride. I've been playing a game I invented called ""mini racquetball"" in your garage. Uh-huh. It's pretty fun. He has not won a single point. You don't have to win to have fun. (knocking on door) Lois? Peter. Zod. Hey. You're parked behind my trapezoid-thing. Yeah, yeah, I'll move it in a sec. Glenn, all this nonsense has to stop now. The only reason this became an issue is because Peter heard something he wasn't supposed to hear. CLEVELAND: Guy from Superman lives here?! And the truth is, we all have private thoughts we don't act on, and that's okay. For instance, every time I'm on the subway, I want to push a stranger onto the tracks. And that's fine! I don't do it! I guess you're right. I don't totally disagree with what Kim Jong-un's doing, but you don't see me moving there. I take medicine I get from the veterinarian. Is that one? No, no, it's not, but the point is, we all have secret thoughts. But there's no reason they should ruin our friendships. Sometimes I think about going to the hospital and switching the babies around. Somali pirates seem cool, too. I wouldn't mind eating the Phillie Phanatic. See? We're all terrible people inside. Joe's a little worse than the rest of us, but we all just shove our thoughts deep down, where they can't hurt anybody. Huh, maybe you're right. Of course I'm right. The secret to happiness is burying all your true feelings and living a life of bland compromise. So here's the question, Glenn. Do you love Peter enough to repress your love for me? Peter, if you're willing to forget all about this, I'm more than happy to continue hiding my true feelings. I do miss us hanging out together. Huh. Sorry I kind of went a little crazy. Ah, that's all right. And I'm sorry I will always love your wife. Which I don't. Thank you, Glenn. All right! What do you say we all celebrate with a game of mini racquetball? Wait. Is mini racquetball just Ping-Pong? Kind of. Boy, it's good to have the gang together again. Yeah, welcome home, buddy. Man, I missed sitting around, just shooting the breeze. Hey, so how'd you get your house back? This ought to be good. I suspended escrow. Oh. Hey, guys, you know that egg dish I was talking about? Turns out that was just a dream I had."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    We now return to the extended director's cut  of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.    Charlie, don't forget what happened to the boy  - who got everything he ever wanted. - What?  He lived happily ever after.  But he did have to earn it.  Hint, hint.  Do it, Charlie!  I'm not going back to that four-person bed!  Hell, I'll do it, if you want!  No! It has to be a child!  What did he just say?  Brian, this does not seem appropriate  to watch in front of the baby.  Not appropriate?  You took me to see Magic Mike XXL.  Uhp, this one's wet.  Uh, this one, too.  Also wet.  Huh. This one's dry,  but the back of the seat in front of it is wet.  Let's put on something more child-friendly.  Time to ""Too-tooty-too"" with The Turtlenecks!  Oh, God, no. These guys are horrible.  Do you kazoo?   I often do   When I am blue   I do kazoo   Tootooty-Too   Goes my kazoo   I will kazoo   Hey how 'bout you?   - (kazoos playing on TV) - Uch. All they're doing  is announcing that they play the kazoo,  and then asking if others also play the kazoo.  This doesn't seem so bad.  I mean, after all, it's a song for babies.  Yeah, but-but that's the thing.  Baby songs never tackle real baby issues.  You know, like like loud noises.  Or teething.  Or when Dad uses me as a lumbar pillow.  - Eh - Ow.  - Eh - Ow. Ow.  - (grunts) - Ow.  - (irritated grunt) - Ow.  (sighs) This thing works better in the car.  Well, how could they address baby issues?  Children's songs are written by adults.  And, dollars to donuts, white adults.  I-I.. Who-who are you mad at, Brian?  Uch, how much time you got?  Not enough for that, but you're right.  If you want a song a baby'll like,  you've got to get a baby to write it.  Well, call John Mayer.  He's a big, fat baby.  No, I'll do it, and you can help.  Well, I I did write  a musical about Alexander Hamilton.  (chuckles) Not-not that one,  but, uh, sure, I'm in.  Ooh, I'm excited.  This'll be great.  And those guys back at the factory can suck it.  I'm gonna get out of this place one day.  Hey, Butch.  Get a load of Stewie.  He says he's gonna get out of here.  (laughing)  You don't know me, man. I'm different.  I got ideas.  Hey, Butch, you hear that?  Stewie's got ideas.  Shut up!  I'm gonna go across that river  and make it to the city on the other side.  I'm gonna be a singer.  BublÃ© over here says he's gonna be a singer.  Hey, BublÃ©, I got a tune for you to sing.  It's called ""Get Your Ass Back on the Forklift, Lunch is Over"".  Hey, Stewie, don't listen to those guys.  Follow your heart.  Shut up, Butch.  You're the loser of this crew.  Hey guys, you hear that?  Butch told me to follow my heart.  (laughter)  Dad, can I have 50 bucks for a shamrock tattoo?  It's time.  All right, but make sure you get it  where everyone can see.  Hold on, Peter.  I-if Chris wants money for something,  maybe it's time he got a part-time job.  He could mow lawns or-or babysit.  I can't work.  I'm too young.  Well, Will Smith's little kid  works as a movie star,  even though he looks like a wet baby horse.  All right, I suppose I could get a job.  Well, maybe even my old job as the guy  racing through an airport  at the end of a romantic comedy.  Taxi! Taxi!  (tires screech)  Hey. Are you crazy?  Crazy for love.  The most amazing girl I've ever met  leaves on a plane in five minutes.  Get in.  I get knocked down, but I get up again   You're never gonna keep me down   I get knocked down, but I get up again   You're never gonna keep me down   What the hell's going on?  This guy's in love.  Is she worth it?  She's a once-in-a-life-time girl.  I'll give you an escort.  He drinks a whiskey drink, he drinks a vodka drink   He drinks a lager drink, he drinks a cider drink   He sings the songs   No charge.  That remind him of the better times   P.A. ANNOUNCER: Final boarding call for Ashley's flight  to stuffy New England college. Final boarding.  Ooh, whoa, whoa, whoa, child.  What's the hurry?  The love of my life, that's what.  We got a code Romeo.  Repeat, code Romeo.  If you get there on time,  there's an extra 50 in it for you.  I love this job!  I get knocked down, but I get up again   You're never gonna keep me down   CHRIS: Ashley, wait!  (panting)  I wouldn't miss this for all the rush hour fares in Bigtown.  Chris, you came. Oh, my God!  Let me get my grandma.  Chris?  Ashley. I love you.  (both grunting)  (groaning)  Oh, you're groaning at me?  You paid $19 to fly Spirit Air.  You get what you get.  All right, Brian, I've written a few songs,  all about stuff babies actually care about.  No more rainbows and unicorns.  Real baby issues.  Right, like heartworm and parvo?  No, baby stuff.  Oh, oh, human babies.  I didn't I didn't realize there was an agenda.  Okay, look, just pay attention.  Momma liked to party when you were in her belly   Drinking, she did some   Momma liked to party when you were in her belly   That's why you are dumb.   I call that ""Momma Liked to Party (Chris's Song)"".  Stewie, that's good. Hey, can I write one?  Yeah, we need as many as we can.  Our first gig is Saturday. It's a birthday party.  Wow, already?  How'd you book a gig so fast?  Easy. I figured out the perfect way  to get the word out to middle-aged moms.  Musical entertainment, available for parties.  Musical entertainment, available for parties.  Hey. Where you drinking that Chardonnay?  Oh, hey, Chris, how's the job hunt going?  Terrible. I can't find a job anywhere.  A lot of people seem to be turned off  by my dishonorable discharge.  What, from the Army?  No, it's a euphemism.  Oh, yucky.  Uh, you guys, I need help unloading the groceries.  My undiagnosed mom injury is flaring up.  These little things of applesauce  better not be for desserts.  WOMAN: Go to hell, Glenn Quagmire!  I'm sorry, but Mondays are Asian only.  Why is your last name Wong?  It's my married name.  Now I see why you're here.  Geez, what was that about?  Ah, a little scheduling mix-up.  I am just so busy, I-I don't have any time  to organize my own life.  Wait a minute, what if you had someone  to help keep you organized? Chris is looking for work.  Maybe he can help you out, be your assistant.  Huh, maybe.  You have any references?  Uh, ""cowabunga,"" ""schwing,"" ""yada, yada, yada.""  Those are pretty good references.  You're hired.  (indistinct conversations)  Look at that. Look at the cake.  ""Happy Birthday Charlie and Uncle Craig.""  And Uncle Craig's written in a different color.  Oh, poor Uncle Craig.  Hey, is that your ex-girlfriend, Olivia?  God, what's she doing here?  She was always such a nightmare.  (children laughing)  Olivia?! Oh, my God, do I look okay?  I hate this shirt. Switch shirts. Switch shirts!  Stewie? Oh, I thought that was you.  Hey, Olivia, hey, what brings you here?  Oh, the birthday boy and I met  at Burt Reynolds' acting camp in Jupiter, Florida.  Well, I'm glad to hear you're still acting.  You know, the last time I saw you, you were  Burning in a cardboard house?  Yeah, burning in a cardboard house, yeah.  Uh, hey, listen, uh, I don't know if you've heard,  but we're the entertainment.  Aw, that's good. Good for you.  Okay, great to see you.  Come on, Stewie, it's not about her.  It's about those six children watching and the spazzy kid  who's just waiting for the snakes.  BOY: Bring out the snakes!  It's a hot crowd, have fun out there.  I'm gonna go feed everything in my van to each other.  Okay, kids, if everyone's done washing their hands  from the snakes, we have some fun music for y  No climbing on the boat!  Okay, now please welcome Red Shirt Blue Shirt.  All right, we're Red Shirt Blue Shirt,  and here's a song we call ""Mommy and Daddy's Room.""  And we think it's one you can all relate to.  When everybody's gone to sleep   And you've said good night moon   There's plenty of noise still coming   From Mommy and Daddy's room   Oh, Daddy says ""please,"" Mommy says ""no""   Daddy says ""come on,"" Mommy says ""whoa""   Daddy goes (grunts), Mommy goes ""ow""   Daddy says ""I'm done,"" Mommy goes ""wow""   Daddy rolls over and falls asleep   Mommy drinks wine in the dark.   My God, did you hear 'em, Stewie? We're a hit.  We got to go out and celebrate.  Oh, he can't go out with you tonight.  He's got a date with me.  Really? Awesome.  Brian, I can't go. I'm not feeling well.  Stewie, I've been standing here the whole time.  But, you know-you know what, that's fine.  I'll just go have a dog-style celebration by myself.  Yeah!  Awesome time!  This is very fun for me!  - Hey! - Oh, hey!  - This is fun, right? - The best!  And me, too!  Great crowd, babe.  What are What is this?  Oh, Olivia's president of our fan club.  She's also doing half the band.  Do you even know what that means?  Uh, let's just say I couldn't toddle right for a week.  Okay, you don't.  All right, if you'll excuse me,  I have a poo poo diaper.  You really think this Olivia thing is a good idea?  Why wouldn't it be?  I don't know. It just seems like  it always ends badly for you two.  And it can be tricky working with an ex.  Look at Kermit and Miss Piggy.  How are you feeling, Miss Piggy?  I heard you called in sick yesterday.  Yeah, I had a frog in my throat.  (short laugh) Right, Kermie?  Eh? Right?  Please stop drinking.  Okay, Chris, I think you're gonna be a great assistant.  Your paperwork appears to be in order,  but before we get started, do you own  a pair of rubber boots that you'd have to wear  if you worked on a fishing boat?  Uh, no, I don't think so.  All right, I guess it'll be a light day today,  but tomorrow you should come wearing those.  Okay, got it.  Now, the first thing I need you to do every morning  is punch me in the stomach because I'm a bad person.  Is this a trick?  It's the furthest thing from a trick. Go ahead.  And it should be pretty hard,  I'm a worse person than you think.  (grunts) Okay, that's really good.  Now I need you to call Time Warner about my cable bill.  (indistinct conversations)  All right, this one is for all the mommies out there.  This is what we're really saying when we're crying.  Please put some butt paste on my button   Butt paste on my button   Smear it on my button for the fire down below   Oh, oh, oh, butt paste on my button   Butt paste on my button   Need it on my button 'cause it   Cools and quells me so.   Stay away, stay away   From the big kid in the baby swing.   There's a little metal box   At the top of the stairs   In the back of the closet   And a tiny little key   That's hidden in a book   In the drawer with the socks   And I know how to use it   To open up the box   And that's where the gun is.     You know, I talk a lot of smack, but at the end of the day,  these guys are pros.  Even Broken Arm Coyote with Washboard.  Hey, let's keep this party rolling.  I'll go get us another badly-scratched  plastic pitcher of soda.  Ugh, finally, he's doing something useful.  What? What do you mean?  Nothing. It's just, you write all the songs,  you've got a better voice, you've got the sweet bod  Oh, my God, babe.  Plus, you've got all the cool catchphrases like ""damn you all""  or ""what the dude"" or whatever.  Uh, it-it's ""deuce."" But, uh,  but yeah, you're-you're right, it I-I do.  Does it-does it sound through the mic  like I'm saying ""dude""? Should it be ""dude""?  Meanwhile, everyone thinks Brian is the star of the group.  Who thinks that?  I don't know. I'm just saying,  after every show, the fans are always petting Brian,  and not you.  No one's allowed to pet me. It's illegal.  I just hate to see Brian  getting all the attention that you deserve.  You should really watch your back.  Wow, it's hard to believe Brian would betray me.  I mean, he was there for me when I hit rock bottom.  See, Brian?  That's a rock bottom.  Thanks for being here for that.  Now get out of here, we're about to drink some Chardonnay.  Chris, could you please get Hannah a thank-you basket  and schedule her next appointment?  I'd like to see her again in two weeks.  Of course. Mr. Quagmire can fit in you  at 3:00 a week from Thursday.  That works.  And you know to fast the night before?  Yup.  And would you like to leave your panties in the fishbowl  for a chance to win a free lunch?  Good luck.  When you gonna do that drawing anyway?  Oh, there's no drawing, I just like smelling the bowl.  You know, you're doing a great job, Chris.  Why don't you jerk the rest of the day off.  Man, this is the best job ever.  And to think I almost took that pop-up restaurant gig.  - Hi, you hungry?! - Aah!  Check, check, Malia.  Check, Obama.  Check, check, check, Malia, Obama.  All right, that's a creepy mic check.  Let's just do a quick run-through of ""Little Brother.""  -  I want a little brother  - (humming the tune)  On second thought   I think I'd   Kill him dead.   Could-could we just cut Brian's mic?  His humming sounds like my table's ready at Chili's.  Stewie, what the hell is your problem?  I'll tell you what my problem is: I'm doing all the work  and you're just riding my coattails.  What are you talking about? I'm just as big a part  of this group as you are.  Oh, really? You're writing about  all your authentic baby experiences?  You asked me to do this with you.  Why you being such a dick?  Because I lost the baby!  What was that?  I don't know, he saw that in a movie or something.  Brian, this seems as good a time as any.  I think it's time to talk about your future with the band.  Are you serious?  You're actually kicking me out of the band?  Not at all. In fact,  I think you and I should kick Stewie out.  And I'll take his place.  - What? - BOY: Bring out the snakes!  Does he just come to all of our shows?  So, you want to fire Stewie  and be Red Shirt Blue Shirt with me?  Absolutely.  You're the whole reason the fans even like the band.  Kids love dogs.  Besides, we've both seen what Stewie's become:  an impossible diva.  Yeah, but he's my friend.  Yeah, well, your friend  has been talking about kicking you out of the band.  Wait, what? He has?  And I don't know if you've considered this,  but the clock is ticking on Stewie's cuteness.  Huh. I guess you're right.  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up  looking like an exact mash-up of Lois and Peter.  (giggles)  Groceries.  Hey. I had a thought about our costumes for today's show.  I could wear a shirt that's both red and blue,  and you can do spin art with all the wussy kids  who are afraid to go on rides.  Yeah? Well, how about this, Stewie?  - You're fired. - Pardon?  That's right. Olivia's taking your place in the band.  You are looking at the new Red Shirt Blue Shirt.  What the dude? Uhp, you know what, ""deuce"" was right.  Come on, Brian. You and I should probably rehearse.  We've got a show in 20 minutes.  Fine, go ahead! It's not gonna be the same!  Like Cheers wasn't the same when they brought in Kirstie Alley.  ALL: Norm!  No, I'm-I'm Rebecca.  Meg, do you know how to use Microsoft Excel?  Yeah. I'm actually pretty good.  Yeah, you would. Dork.  But I do need to make that spreadsheet or I'm fired.  Oh, my God.  Peter, our dishwasher is full of sex toys.  Oh, yeah, Chris put those in there.  It's for his job. He's workin' for Quagmire now.  He's washing sex toys for Quagmire?  Not just that. He also takes pictures  of Quagmire's genitals to track sore growth.  So, brace yourself when you open iPhoto.  It's on the ""Griffin Family"" account.  Peter, my parents have access to that.  What's wrong with this worm?  And you knew about this?  How could you let him do this disgusting stuff?  What? You're the one who wanted Chris to get a job.  Yeah, like mowing lawns or trimming bushes.  Oh, he's doing one of those.  That's it.  I'm calling Quagmire right now and putting an end to this.  (line rings)  CHRIS: You have reached Glenn Quagmire.  Neither he nor his assistant is available.  To schedule a liaison, press one.  To cancel a liaison, press two.  If you're calling to report a pregnancy, please fill out  our online form, and we will mail you a check for $180.  Thank you, and have a giggity day.  (beep)  Chris, this is your mother.  Get these dildos out of the dishwasher.  (cheering, applause)  When everybody's gone to sleep   And you've said good night moon   There's plenty of noise still coming   From Mommy and Daddy's room   Oh, Daddy says ""please"", Mommy says ""no""   Daddy says ""come on"", Mommy says ""whoa""   Daddy goes (grunts), Mommy goes ""ow""   Daddy says ""I'm done"", Mommy goes ""wow""   STEWIE, BRIAN & OLIVIA:  Daddy rolls over and falls asleep   Mommy drinks wine in the dark.   (cheering, applause)  Thank you, Quahog.  That was great. They loved us.  Yeah, I guess, but did you see what I saw?  That kid with the cane?  Yeah, what do you think is wrong with him?  No, Stewie was out there.  - So? - So?  We're singing a song he wrote.  This whole thing was his idea.  Brian, don't mess this up.  We've got a good thing going.  I-I hate to tell you this, but I'm afraid  Red Shirt Blue Shirt is done.  I can't do this. I'm out.  I don't care. I don't need you.  I can get a hundred dogs to fit that stupid blue shirt.  You're a monster.  Like Frankenstein, when he became a loan officer.  So, I'm looking for money to open a small business.  We plan to sell antique lamps.  (intrigued grunt)  Handmade blankets.  (intrigued grunt)  And pitchforks.  (furious grunt)  Chris, there you are. We need to talk.  What, are you walkin' a horse?  Did Quagmire get a horse?  Oh no, here we go.  I want a horse!  Peter, it's not a horse.  Chris, what the hell is that?  Oh, this is Mr. Quagmire's horse gimp.  What is a ""horse gimp""?  It's a sexual fetishist who derives erotic pleasure  from dressing in horse-themed leather gear.  Want to see me feed him a carrot?  - Absolutely not. - Hell yes.  Chris, this is no job for a teenage boy.  You have to quit right now.  I can't quit. I'm actually good at this job.  Plus, I'm making decent money.  MORT: You could work at the pharmacy.  Quiet, Triscuit!  Ooh, hook me to the plow!  Chris, I have $1,100 in a paint can in the garage.  Just take that, and we'll never speak of this again.  Okay.  Great. Now let's all go home.  Well, that's what I get for horsing around.  Ah, your joke wasn't funny enough.  (indistinct conversations)  Stewie?  Oh, hello, Brian.  I'm here to apologize.  And to let you know I quit the band.  You did?  Yes. It's nothing without you.  You were the band.  Those were your songs.  And I'm sorry if I let Olivia manipulate me.  (sighs) I guess she manipulated both of us.  There's just something about her flat chest and muscular legs.  Look, I never should've treated you the way I did.  I suppose I didn't treat you so well either.  So, what do you say? Can we put this all behind us  and go back to the way things were?  Of course we can.  Hey, I wonder if she's gonna keep the band going.  Probably. She told me  she was just gonna replace me with another dog.  Yes, but who?  I don't know. Probably some dog  neither you or I have ever met.  (cheering)  All right, listen up, you little pieces of garbage.  This song's about gettin' heartburn from baked clams.  And other kid stuff."
Family Guy s15e02 Episode Script            ,"


                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    (CROWD CHATTERING, LIVELY ITALIAN MUSIC PLAYING)  Ah, the Feast of San Gennaro.  Every child here has seen a relative  murdered in a barber chair.  Step right up!  Teach an old Italian lady how to use an iPad!  Now, that sounds like fun. I'll give it a try.  Hey, how are you? Look what I got for you.  What is it? It's a tablet computer.  I don't want it.  But you don't even know what it is.  I don't want it.  But you can watch movies on it.  My eyes hurt.  I'm trying to do something nice here!  For the last time, I don't want it.  I bet you if Joey was giving it to you, you'd take it.  Don't you bring him into this.  Joey was a good boy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, Joey was a good boy?  You thought he was making 100 grand a year hauling lumber?  Don't you start with this.  He was dirty, Ma!  I can't hear this! I won't hear it!  - He was an angel! - Oh, that's right.  ""Angel Joey,"" great Joey, perfect Joey.  I got to go to the church.  Oh, yeah, sure, light another candle.  That'll bring him back.  You watch your tongue.  Admit it, you wish it was me in that car instead of him!  Just take your little TV and go!  It's an iPad, you dumb cow!  (GROANS)  I guess I don't have any sons now.  Ma! I'm sorry, Ma!  Ma! Ma!  Hey, Bri, look over there.  That guy looks like Frank Sinatra, Jr.  Stewie, this is Federal Hill.  Everybody looks like Frank Sinatra, Jr.  Well, then who's that guy  who looks like a young Frank Sinatra?  Oh, that's Woody Allen's son, but you're right,  that other guy behind him is Frank Sinatra, Jr.  Stewie! Elliot!  (CHUCKLES): It-it's actually Brian.  We've-we've met many times before.  Then who's Elliot?  I-I really wouldn't know.  This is a bad start to whatever we're doing.  Well, now, what brings you fellas to the festival?  My dad will drive long distances for ice  with colored liquid in it.  PETER: They got blue!  And we all love the Italian food.  Oh, you like Italian food?  Want a meatball?  Yeah, I'm gonna pass on that, but it's a shame  we can't get good Italian food like this in Quahog.  Well, maybe the three of us ought to open  an Italian restaurant there.  Open our own Italian restaurant?  I say, that sounds fun.  You, uh, you keep meatballs in your jacket?  Oh, yeah, all my pockets are lined with Reynolds Wrap.  I learned that from my old buddies:  Dean Martin, Jr., Joey Bishop, Jr.,  and Sammy Davis the Third.  Hey, where's Chris?  He's over there playing that carnival game.  (ITALIAN ACCENT): Step right up!  Everybody take a chance on Whack-a-Big-a-Pussy!  (REPEATING RAPIDLY): Hey, Ton'!  This is not what I thought it was!  (YELLS)  Oh, my God, Chris is out of control!  I know!  It must be all the violence in movies and sex on TV.  Oh.  See, I listen. (CHUCKLES)  Peter, we need to talk about what happened  at the street fair.  Lois, it's an Italian festival.  You're supposed to yell ""Bella, Bella""  and grab as much fat ass as you can.  No, I'm talking about Chris.  I had no idea he had so much pent-up aggression.  We have to deal with his anger issues before he hurts himself.  Ah, that's good thinking, Lois.  I've seen what happens  when people hold in their aggression for too long.  Don't forget, I was in that elevator with Jay-Z.  Hey, could you have your guy hit ""two""?  I got to get down to the business center  to print out my boarding pass.  Oh! Hey! That's gonna leave a mark!  (CHUCKLES) That's from a movie.  So, you girls traveling with your dad here?  Hey, don't kick him, Muddy Shoes.  He's got a white suit on.  Hey, look, I don't know if you guys are really staying here,  but you can't get into the pool without a room key.  Okay, Chris, your mom and I want to help you  get out some of that aggression, so I thought you and me  could huck rotten apples at passing cars.  Oh, I didn't know we had brown apple in the forecast.  Welp, we needed it.  Wow, can I have a turn?  (TIRES SCREECHING)  Hey, which one of you threw that apple at my car?  He did it. He dragged me out here.  I wanted to be in school, sir.  Where'd you get a cannon like that, kid?  I work out my right arm three times a day.  Mm, Free weights?  No, mostly JPEGs of Helen Hunt on my hard drive.  Well, I'm Coach Doyle, and I head up the baseball team  at James Woods High.  What fake class do they also make you teach?  - Driver's ed, right? - No, wood shop.  Ah, that was my second guess.  Tell me, son, how would you like to pitch  for the high school team?  Baseball's the sport people play while eating, right?  Oh, yeah, sometimes I even watch a whole Blacklist.  I don't know, I've never played baseball before.  Oh, come on, Chris, you got to do it.  If you don't, you'll regret it.  Just like Jesus' friend, Evan, who bailed on the Last Supper.  Aw, they did a painting?  I would've gone if I knew they were gonna do a painting.  Here we are, fellas.  The future site of Quahog's newest Italian restaurant.  Wow, this is a great location.  Can we afford this?  Sure we can.  I set up one of those Kickstarters.  Then I realized how stupid that is  and I went to the bank for a loan like an adult.  Now, fellas, the tables should all be bolted to the floor  to prevent theft.  You know, most restaurants go out of business  because people are stealing the tables.  The toilets should also be bolted to the floor.  I think that's pretty standard, Frank, but okay.  Great. Now let's go find some chump's restaurant  and steal his tables and toilets.  James Woods is winning for now, but y'all never know  what might happen in the moments to come.  I mean, look, there's two baseball guys  out on the bases right now.  What if they's run to the scoring place?  BRUCE (OVER P.A.): Oh, here comes a new boy.  All right, Chris!  Wow, I've never seen him run onto a baseball field  when he wasn't chasing a duck or being chased by a duck.  That a duck over there?  Ah, come on!  What the hell's Coach Doyle thinking  bringing in that fat slob?!  You know what?  I bet you a hundred bucks that ""fat slob"" strikes this kid out.  Ha, you're on.  Strike one!  (CROWD MURMURING)  Strike two!  BRUCE (OVER P.A.): Ooh!  (EXHALES)  Strike three!  (CHEERING)  BRUCE (OVER P.A.): Three strikes and he's out,  just like my cousin Freddie with the drugs.  Holy crap, a hundred bucks!  Hey, nice going, Chris!  Wow, look how proud my dad is.  Oh, my God, a duck!  It was a trap!  (LOUD QUACKING)  Guys, tonight the drinks are on me.  I just won a hundred bucks off Chris's baseball game.  Really? How'd you do that?  This dad took one look at Chris and thought he'd suck,  but it turns out Chris is a great pitcher.  I'm so proud of the money I won betting on him.  You know, I bet there are plenty of other baseball dads  who'd also assume Chris stinks.  Peter, we could make a lot of money.  Yeah, we could make Toni Braxton money.  Is that is that a lot?  It's a lot, and then nothing.  And then a record whose proceeds go directly to creditors.  (""CENTERFIELD"" BY JOHN FOGERTY PLAYING)  Put me in, Coach   I'm ready to play   Today   Put me in, Coach   I'm ready to play   Today   Look at me   I can be   Centerfield   Well, I spent some time in the Mudville Nine   Watching it from the bench   You know I took some lumps   When the Mighty Casey struck out   So Say Hey Willie   Tell the Cobb   And Joe DiMaggio   Don't say it ain't so   You know the time is now.   Frank, where the hell is everybody?  This was supposed to be our big opening night.  I'll tell you what the problem is.  Every successful restaurant has a hook or a gimmick.  That's what we're lacking.  (GASPS) No, we're not.  Frank, you're the hook! That's right.  We just need to make you the face of the restaurant.  It may be the five loaves of garlic bread  I ate this morning talking, but I think that's a swell idea.  (TUNE OF ""I WISH I WERE IN LOVE AGAIN"" PLAYING)  You'll love the meal   The fancy feel   The showbiz stories while you eat your veal   It's family dining with a mobster feel   At Frank Sinatra's restaurant   Junior!  The wine is red   With lots of bread   (AS MARLON BRANDO): And portions bigger than a horse's head.  You'll burp up sausages tonight in bed   At Frank Sinatra's restaurant   Here's a toast   To our host   The food's not great, but   Drink enough and you won't know   The guests will swoon and Frank will croon   A ""beep-bop-dooby-dop"" Italian tune   You dine like royalty   At Frank Sinatra's restaurant   We got big plans to please our fans   Our cocktail waitress has enormous cans   A men's room servant who will dry your hands   At Frank Sinatra's restaurant   Our pizza pies could win a prize   The jukebox catalog is double size   It plays both Capitol and, yes, Reprise   That's ""Repreeze.""  At Frank Sinatra's restaurant   Gorgeous views   And top-shelf booze   Yes, we serve Jews   Um, that was never an issue   So, raise your glass   You'll have a gas   But seating's limited, so move your ass   And plant it firmly   Here at Frank Sinatra's restaurant   Frank's restaurant   Frank's res taurant.   (MUSIC ENDS)  (CHUCKLES) Wow!  Look at this, guys.  I can't believe we made all this in one game.  Yeah, I'm having a great time  handling this money and then touching my eyeball.  Jerome, another round for my blurry friends.  Yeah, we got a good thing going.  We just have to keep Chris's talent a secret.  TOM TUCKER (OVER TV): Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.  Our top story tonight, the James Woods High baseball team  is headed to the district championship,  thanks to their secret weapon, star pitcher Chris Griffin.  Ah, crap, now everyone knows Chris is a ringer!  Tom Tucker just ruined everything.  This sucks even worse than when I stubbed my toe.  Aah!  Why does everything bad always happen to me?!  Answer me, guy in box and guy on cross!  (LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING)  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Stewie, can I talk to you?  Look, Brian, I affectionately pat all the waiters on the ass.  And if anyone has a problem with it,  they should come to me directly!  No, no, it's not that.  I-I've been going through our receipts,  and we're actually losing money.  Well, yeah, duh.  Frank comps every meal.  Look, he's doing it again.  Little-known secret about Charlton Heston.  Never used toilet paper.  Just drop and go.  Uh, here, let me get that check for you.  (SIGHS)  Well, it's official.  Nobody wants to bet against Chris now.  Damn it! I can't believe my kid  isn't making money for us anymore.  I feel like Jessica Simpson's dad.  Well, there are plenty of guys willing to bet  on James Woods High to win, I'll tell you that.  The only way we could ever make money now is if Chris lost.  Wait a minute, Joe, that's it!  All we got to do is take those bets  and get Chris to take a dive!  Wait, hold on, Peter.  You're gonna ask your own son to lose on purpose?  Damn, Quagmire!  Your fridge gives you water from the door?  Hey, champ, what you doing?  My Spanish homework.  Oh, well, then maybe I'll just say this to you in Spanish.                Chris, what the hell are you doing?!  Calm down. This is how they package Snapple now.  They're trying to trick kids into drinking it.  You may not believe this,  but there was a time when Snapple ruled the nation.  Preposterous!  It's true. Even Jerry Seinfeld drank it.  And he was the president of the '90s.  But why are you so down?  Dad told me I have to lose the championship game on purpose.  He what?!  Peter, get in here right now!  Wow, someone's day-horny!  Oh, hey, Chris.  Did you tell Chris he had to lose  the district championship?!  Let me just get a garbage bag. Hold on.  Okay, now that I'm decent.  Yes, I did tell Chris to throw the game.  But it's okay; it's for gambling.  What?! You're betting on Chris's baseball team?!  Technically against Chris's baseball team.  Are you crazy?!  Do I look crazy?!  What do you think puts the food on our table  and the garbage bags on our backs?!  Chris, your father's a jackass.  When you get on that field,  you try your very best and play to win.  You understand me?  Yeah. Thanks, Mom.  But, Lois, if Chris wins that game,  I'll be out a ton of money and I'll have to kiss a fella!  I take all kinds of bets.  Hey, Frank, we have to talk.  You've got to stop giving away all the food for free.  Yeah, otherwise there's no way we're gonna make a profit.  Oh, we don't have to worry about money.  I might be doing a Duets thing with that Lady Goo-Ga.  Uh-huh, that's wrong.  Anyway, the restaurant's gonna go under  if you keep giving away food.  All right, all right.  Thank you, Frank.  I appreciate you trying it my way.  Thank you.  What was that?  Oh, I get 40 bucks  every time somebody says ""my way.""  Nancy gets 60.  What do you mean Chris won't take a dive?!  We already took a ton of bets!  Look, I'm sorry, you guys,  but my hot piece-of-ass wife says no way.  It's a weird time to brag about your wife, Peter.  I don't know, I've just been so horny today.  Oh, man, I don't need to know that!  Well, pull it together, Peter,  'cause we're about to lose a lot of money!  (SIGHS) I know.  We're screwed once Chris takes the mound  with that awesome arm of his.  Wait, so what you're saying is Chris isn't the problem,  his arm is.  I guess.  Okay. We hear you, Peter.  Loud and clear.  Yeah, we'll fix this problem.  You guys are creeping me out.  All right, I'm gonna exit while discreetly  checking out the hot chick by the door.  You guys heard what I heard, right?  Peter just asked us to break Chris's arm.  Well, he intimated.  I don't know what that means,  but let's go rough up a teenager for beer money!  Oh, I call biting!  Okay, there's the baseball team's locker room right there.  Perfect! And we look like regular high school students,  so we'll fit right in.  Joe, are you sure about these clothes?  Trust me. I bought the absolute latest issue of Archie comics,  and this is what the kids are wearing.  Oh, hey, fellow teens.  Wait a minute, teenagers don't have wheelchairs!  (SOBBING): No! Oh, no!  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Okay, guys, we've served our last free meal.  Here I go with the check.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Last time we ate here,  Mr. Sinatra's son said it was free.  Okay, uh, everyone, new policy!  As is the case with many restaurants,  you're going to have to pay for your food.  What? This food ain't worth paying for.  Yeah, the only reason we eat here is 'cause it's free.  Look whose restaurant thinks it's so good!  Oh, yeah? If it was Joey's restaurant, you would've paid.  (CRYING)  Ma!  I'm sorry, Ma!  Ma!  I can't believe it.  They hated us.  Well, fellas, we gave it our best shot.  If you need me, I'll be back in Palm Springs,  which has been completely taken over by the gays.  So, want to grab whatever wine is left  and then burn the place down?  Maybe, but first, let's have an unearned  end-of-the-series moment where we turn out the lights  on our own place.  Sorry, pal, we're closed.  (PIANO PLAYING SOMBER MUSIC)  Peter, we've got great news!  Chris isn't playing!  He's not? Why?  Well, 'cause we broke his arm like you told us to.  Shattered. We shattered his arm.  You what?! I never told you to do that!  You didn't? That's what I thought I heard.  Quagmire, this is humbling, but it may be time  for all of us to talk about hearing aids.  I feel terrible! I got to go find my son!  Chris!  Dad, my arm's broke! And look, a Camaro!  Oh, that guy must be so boss.  But listen, Chris, I had no idea this was gonna happen.  Look, I was wrong to bet on your games,  and it's even worse that I told you to lose.  I'm so sorry.  Oh, that's okay, Dad.  I just feel bad that my arm is broken  in so many places and hurts so much.  No, Chris, I've been a terrible dad lately.  You found something you were great at,  and instead of being happy for you,  I tried to use it to make money.  And now your arm is broken and your baseball career is over.  Not necessarily.  What? What are you talking about?  Well, for the last few weeks, since my right arm's  been exhausted from pitching, my left arm's had to, uh,  pick up the slack in the bathroom.  (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING)  (CROWD CHEERING)  You see the pitcher?  That's my kid.  Aah! Son of a bitch!  CHRIS: Oh, my God!  Sorry, Mr. Quagmire!  I heard that bone break.  My ears are fine.  Well, Chris, we're very proud of you  for making it to the district championship.  Thanks, Mom.  It was really something, Lois.  The next pitch Chris threw hit his coach in the head,  so there was no one to take him out of the game.  Chris walked the next 46 batters.  State record.  Wow, Chris! State record!  Yeah, they got crushed.  But at least I didn't have to pay out  all those bets and kiss a guy.  But I saw you kissing the driver of that Camaro.  That that-that was something else.  (WEAKLY): Baseball!"

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.  Coming up, why one hello a day  to the receptionist at work is the magic number.  But first, pilot strike at Quahog Airport.  Picketing began on Thursday Weird day to start a strike  And both sides appear to be at an impasse.  So ground control is telling Major Tom  this could be long one.  (CHUCKLES) Does anyone else like David Bowie?  Hey, what the hell is up with this letter?  It says I'm no longer covered on your health insurance.  Oh, yeah. They don't cover dogs no more.  You could do COBRA for $7,300 a month though.  Would that be something you'd be interested in?  I need that health insurance. You know I have a hernia.  What if I need surgery?  Well, if you need insurance that bad,  maybe it's time for you to go out  and get a job of your own.  This sucks.  How did you get a hernia?  Actually, I got it performing  an incredible act of heroism.  (CAR CRASHES, WATER SPLASHES)  Oh, my God!  Somebody help me! I'm sinking!  (GRUNTING)  Hurry! I can't hold it!  Okay, let me just unstrap my baby.  Oh! Oh! Oh! Slipping, slipping. Sorry.  What do we want?  PILOTS: Fair wages!  When do we want it?  Originally now, but it's been delayed until 9:40  due to weather in Philly!  (SIGHS) This is a mess.  Like when Peter rode that Access Hollywood bus.  (WOMEN LAUGHING, CHATTERING)  (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING INSIDE)  Ah, bachelorette party.  Can I fit this in?  Okay, cool. I got time.  Hello, ladies.  Wow, here comes the bride, huh?  More than once, if I have anything to do with it.  Finally, the stripper's here!  What? No, I'm not a stripper. I'm a pilot.  (WOMEN WHOOPING)  See? This is a real uniform.  Ooh. Take something else off, sexy.  (EXCITED CHATTER) Oh, yeah!  (LAUGHS): All right!  Oh, yeah?  You want a little more, huh?  (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES, WOMEN CHEERING)  Yeah! All right.  Who wants me to stow my bag under their seat?  (CHEERING CONTINUES)  Boy, and I thought the Federal Hill bakery had nice buns.  (LAUGHS)  You're talented, Denise.  You should really go for it.  Wow.  What a day.  Please don't comment.  Oh, look at you.  - Did you get a job? - Bitch.  Did I get a job?  Um, this ain't a life-vest, sista.  It's a work vest from a little place called Mega Hardware.  'Cause that's basically what I am now.  Just an everyday, working-class Joe.  Well, good for you.  No. No, Brian.  This doesn't feel right today.  Yes.  There's a rat trap in that cabinet.  With a foot in it.  And somewhere in this house, there's a footless rat.  Well, I'm off to watch some Fox News  in front of the old boob tube.  Tommy used to work on the docks   Union's been on strike   He's down on his luck   It's tough, so tough.   - Hey. - No.  - I wasn't sure. - I'm sure.  - Okay. - Well, got to go.  Got to do some more picketing.  Seriously? It's, like, 9:00 at night.  Yeah, uh well, it's, uh  Cleveland's stealing shot glasses!  I don't like drinking NyQuil out of them little cups.  Where the hell's Quagmire going?  The airport's that way.  He doesn't know we're following him, Joe.  You don't have to duck down.  I'm not. You took a pretty hard right turn back there.  I've been like this for a while.  (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING INSIDE)  What's he doing?  This is one of them places  where women go to see male strippers.  Some bisexual men go as well.  (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES)  I don't see him.  Ladies, this is your pilot speaking.  I am in the full, upright and locked position.  (WOMEN CHEERING)  Oh, my.  (MUSIC STOPS)  Oh, my God! What are you guys doing here?!  PETER: Crap. Our disguises didn't work.  Quagmire, I didn't know you were a male stripper.  I wasn't. Not until the strike, anyway.  I've been out of work for three weeks.  I'm out of money. I-I had to do something.  God, I'm so embarrassed.  Why? Stripping is a very respectable profession.  If it weren't respectable,  why would real estate agents go to strip clubs for lunch?  He's right. This is tremendous.  Are you banging all these chicks?  Hey, hey! That is offensive.  I am a dancer, not a gigolo!  Captain Cockpit, my friend is about to get married,  and we were wondering if you'd have sex with her for $500.  I'm a gigolo.  Oh, hey, it's that guy.  Are you gonna say, ""Who else but Quagmire?""  (CLEARS THROAT) N uh, no, I, uh, uh,  w-wanted to know if Quagmire  was available tomorrow evening?  Are are you gay?  Uh, of course not. No.  Uh, but I'm unable to properly  have sex with my wife, so I figured, you know.  Eh, who else but Quagmire?  Hey, awesome cameo.  Hey, sorry I'm late, guys.  Had to stop at the dry cleaner.  The dry cleaner?  Wow, somebody struck it rich.  You know, I got to tell you,  I was sweating that pilot strike,  but now that I'm a gigolo, I'm making money by the fistful.  Is that a giggity?  That is a giggity.  Hey, Quagmire, I couldn't help but notice  you got some dry cleaning hanging up  in the backseat of your car.  - Did you win the lottery? - No.  Well, I hope you're not actually doing that gigolo thing.  You know, prostitution is illegal.  Uh, uh, no, no, no. It's, uh, it's something else.  Uh, uh, Quagmire's, uh,  selling online Internet cyber stuff.  Wow. Good for you, Quagmire.  (LAUGHS)  You and Gates, huh?  (PHONE VIBRATES)  Uh, geez, I got to go home and change into my Tarzan costume.  Uh, uh for for for the Web.  Huh. I got to get a computer.  Excuse me. How many BTUs does this grill have?  (CHUCKLES): Oh, man. That puppy?  More than you need, less that I want.  E-Excuse me. Do you have a small grocery cart  I could put this boat-sized hunk of lumber in?  Probably out in the parking lot.  Can you tell me where I can find extension cords?  - Aisle 25. - I was just there.  - 26. - There is no 26.   So Goby gets up on the lift  Don't mind me.  Just grabbing myself a cup of mud.  I like mine black.  Black as night.  Black as sin, know what I'm saying?  (CHUCKLES) Haven't introduced myself.  Guys in my crew call me ""The Ratchet.""  Brian, it's not your break.  Get out there and help the customers.  Brian? (CHUCKLES) Who are you, my father?  Ha! This guy.  - Get out there! - Yes, sir.  That guy's got no idea how hard I'm work  Bird! A bird got in! Awesome!  (PLAYING GENTLE CLASSICAL MUSIC)  (CELL PHONE RINGING)  PETER: Hello?  Hey, Quagmire, what's going on?  Oh, you need a ride?  Yeah, sure. I can come get you.  I'm not doing anything.  (FOOTSTEPS DEPARTING)  (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES)  Meg, that was the last guy,  so just lock up when you're done.  Thanks for the ride.  One of my tricks drove me here from the Clam,  and I didn't have any money for a cab.  Why not? Didn't she just pay you for sex?  No. After it was over, she said she wasn't gonna pay.  Well, that ain't fair.  You can't let these women take advantage of you like that.  What apartment is she in? I'll go talk to her.  She's in unit 17.  You know, if you're going back in anyway,  can you grab my belt?  It's reversible, so I'd hate to lose it.  PETER: Hey, you didn't pay my friend!  So I'm gonna play with your doorbell until you pay up.  (DOORBELL RINGING RAPIDLY)  WOMAN: Stop it!  PETER: I can do this all day. I love buttons.  WOMAN: Fine, here's your money!  (DOORBELL STOPS)  Here you go.  Peter, this is amazing. Thank you.  Hey, you know what?  Here's a little something for your trouble.  You're giving me a cut?  Wow, thanks!  No problem. It's just too bad you're not here every time.  Well, I could be.  I mean, my days are pretty open,  and I don't sleep a lot at night 'cause of health stuff.  Huh. That'd be kind of nice, actually.  Hey, maybe you could drive me around and help me out,  and I could even pay you a little something for your time.  Sure, that sounds great. And you know what?  It'll be nice having a little extra cash  to bet on college football.  Yeah, I'd like to bet a hundred bucks.  You want to pick a team?  No, just take it.  I thought you had the day off.  Maybe from the store, but it's not like things  take a day off from needing repairs, am I right? (CHUCKLES)  Oh, looks like this cabinet door is a good place to start.  Yup, she's off-kilter.  I'm gonna have to plane her down.  Lois, what year was this house built?  Uh, I don't know. Maybe 1945?  Good, it's grandfathered in. Thought I'd need a variance.  Don't want to get a code vi.  (CHUCKLES) ""Vi"" is violation.  ""Code"" is just code.  I don't know, Brian, it looks straight to me.  - What? - It's straight.  I-I don't know what that means. ""It's-it's straight""?  Oh, you mean plumb.  Y-You're saying the door is plumb.  Wow, Brian, you do know all the lingo.  Ah, come on, that's just stuff you pick up on the site.  I'm gonna go use a miter to jerry-rig a shim jamb  strap hinge quarter-round soffit  two-by-six dowel cherry-picker flim-flam.  You know, Rupert, Brian's douche-iness  should infuriate me, but the truth is he seems happy.  So I guess I'll just do nothing and that's that.  (THEME SONG PLAYING)  Can't do it. Let's get him fired.  (""WORKIN' FOR A LIVIN'"" BY HUEY LEWIS AND THE NEWS PLAYING)  Some days won't end ever and some days pass on by   I'll be working here forever, at least until I die   Damned if you do, damned if you don't   I'm supposed to get a raise next week   You know damn well I won't   Workin' for a livin', workin'   Workin' for a livin'  Workin'   Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'   I'm takin' what they givin'   'Cause I'm workin' for a livin'   Workin' for a livin', livin' and a-workin'   Whoo!   Boy, I have a whole new respect for Hayden Panettiere.  - (PHONE RINGS) - Giggity.  PETER: I'm pulling up. You ready?  Oh, hey, Peter, listen, I can't work tonight. I'm spent.  That last trick was like  trying to use an empty bottle of hand soap.  But you got to work. I set up five appointments.  That's a lot of money. Sorry, I can't do it.  You're just gonna have to cancel them.  What the hell did you say to me?!  Peter, what are you doing?!  You trippin', boy?!  You're going out if I tell you you're going out, bitch!  Okay.  What what's in your pimp cup?  Uh, it's actually a wheatgrass, ginger mixture.  I was in the middle of a cleanse.  I didn't know we'd be doing this pimp thing,  but I made a promise to my body.  (SIGHS): Ah.  Not great.  Peter, what you doing all dressed up for church?  This ain't Easter.  No, Cleveland, these are my work clothes.  - You hosting Family Feud? - No, I'm a pimp.  Um, Big Pete, if we're gonna be sitting,  may I use my penis donut?  Bitch, I don't care.  Dang, Quagmire, you're lucky.  He take care of you.  Yeah, no, no, it's great.  Um, I'm making a lot of money.  I'm actually really happy.  I'm actually very hungry.  Nobody's gonna want you if you're fat!  You want to eat?  Get up to that bar and earn your keep.  W-What should I ask for, $500?  You're not worth that much. You're trash!  Ask for two.  You know I hit you and whore you out  because I love you, right?  Hi, there. You want to party?  And can I have some of your bread?  Hi, handsome.  You can't have my bread, but you can have  something of mine that smells like bread.  Okay, let's go.  Just so you know,  it takes me a long time.  All right, Rupert, if we're going to teach Brian a lesson,  we're going to need some muscle.  You, you and you, 20 bucks for the day.  Hop in the back.  No!  Asiento trasero Trasero!  Forget it, just get in.  Anyone who doesn't enjoy the music of Josh Groban  can get out of the (BLEEP) car.  You raise me up   Okay, if you had a friend who worked at Mega Hardware,  how would you get him fired?  You ask him for papers?  Okay, good.  Uh, that, unfortunately, won't work in this instance.  But I like your effort, Luis.  Uh, any other ideas?  You could kill a guy.  You know what, Carlos, you stay quiet for a while.  I really only need two of you.  You'll still be paid.  You ask for papers?  Okay, is there any idea out there besides killing a guy  or getting someone deported?  We do good job, we live with you?  Well, you just offered to kill a guy,  so you're not exactly number one on my roommate list.  Now, let's go. I paid good money for you, I need answers!  I want your best, and I won't stand for  even one more stupid idea!  You shake up boss's soda and give to him.  When he open it, it explode!  This is why I pushed you.  Huh. I guess that Brian Griffin is a good egg after all.  (SHOUTS)  Griffin, you're fired!  (MELANCHOLY JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)  HOOKER 1: I never liked prostitutes  because they sell their bodies to all types of men.  HOOKER 2: I turned my first trick  when I had my first one-night stand.  I had sex for dinner and drinks.  QUAGMIRE: Being a prostitute is no fun.  You have to work nights, weekends.  I hear on SNL the women are funnier than the guys now,  but I don't know, I'll never see it.  NARRATOR: We meet Quagmire,  a small-town boy with big-city dreams  who has fallen deep into the game of prostitution  at the Point.  You know, some people ask me,  ""Would you want your son to be a hooker?""  My answer is always, ""Hey, lady, are we talking,  or am I beefing ya?""  I kind of want to see Guardians of the Galaxy,  but I also kind of feel like there might be scary parts.  Hey, honey, you shopping for groceries?  You know what that means?  ""Shopping for groceries"" is what I say instead of,  ""Do you want to pay me for sex?""  so I can't get arrested.  Stewie, did you hire three Mexican guys  to shake a soda can and give it to my boss?  What?!  One's Guatemalan.  Damn it, Stewie, you got me fired!  Oh, who are you kidding? You got yourself fired.  Parading around there,  pretending you know the first thing about tools.  You know what?  You're going down there with me right now  to tell them what you did.  Get your hands off me!  I'll go floppy dead weight on you!  (GROANS)  Ah, crap! My stomach!  I think my hernia ruptured!  Oh, my God!  Damn it, it's bad. It's bad!  I'll get Lois. She can take you to the hospital.  No, she can't.  Thanks to you, I don't have insurance anymore.  What are we gonna do?!  I'll get the gun!  No, Stewie, you have to fix me.  What?! I'm not a doctor!  Just look it up on your phone or something!  Ugh, hold on. I've got to update iOS.  Stewie!  Okay, okay, got it.  It says I have to make an incision,  retract the hernia sac,  and then suture the abdominal lining.  How am I supposed to do that?!  Grab my tool belt.  Use the self-sharpening linoleum blade.  (SCREAMS): Ah!  And then hold the incision open with a vise grip,  and use the slip-joint pliers to get the muscle back in position.  Okay, okay.  Now it's saying I have to suture it.  I've got some monofilament line you can use.  It's from aisle eight, above the chains and cables.  ""Monofilament line,"" ""slip-joint pliers.""  I've got to say, Brian, it seems like you really did  learn something on that job.  You're right. I guess I did.  But please, stitch me up.  Just be careful and take your time.  This is the delicate part, because  Yeah, I'm gonna just use the staple gun.  Ah! Damn it! Ah!  You know what? That was really easy.  That guy who killed Joan Rivers must be terrible at this.  Hey, there Oh. What are you doing here?  Quagmire?  Uh, oh uh, uh  I have a hobby that takes me this way.  Hey, I'm freezing. You got a blanket in there or something?  I got a towel, but it's wet because I'm eating peaches.  I lied about the hobby.  I was sinning.  I'm going to drive away backwards now.  Hey, baby, you want to party?  Get in.  You guys having a good night?  I like that it's getting dark earlier.  What are you guys gonna be for Halloween?  Big Pete, help!  She wants to do German things!  German things!  What? No! He hasn't eaten anything in days!  It's not gonna work!  Nein! Nein!  (GRUNTING)  Ah! She's got us both!  Help us, pimps and hos!  Help us, HBO camera crew!  God, Quagmire, most of that was horrible.  I know.  Eventually, I might want to try it again.  Hey, listen, buddy.  I'm sorry about all this.  I guess I just got caught up in the money  and-and assumed you were okay with it  because of the sex.  I don't know, Peter. I think you're just mad  I didn't come to see your Pretenders cover band.  Yes, well, that may be.  Speaking of which, the Pretend Pretenders  are playing again this weekend.  Uh, much like the real band,  we have been described as ""meh.""  Still, I'm really sorry.  Can you find it in yourself to forgive me,  and maybe we can just go back to being friends?  I'd like that.  Hopefully, the pilot strike will end soon  and I can get my old job back.  Oh, the strike ended a month ago.  What?! Why didn't you tell me?!  I did.  Are you still GlennQ10@aol.com?  No.  Ah, well. There you go."

Uh we can't go into the time machine right now.  But they're going to kill us all!  All right, all right, just one second.  So, how was your weekend?  I-Is, is it your line?  I don't Uh, no, I don't think so.  I'm-I'm sorry, whose line is it?  Cut! (BELL RINGING)  That was Peter's line. Where's Peter?  Sorry, I was in my trailer eating fancy nuts and smoking.  (SIGHS) All right, everybody, take five.  Okay, I'll be in my dressing room playing online poker.  That's me asking for help.  Hi, I'm James Woods.  You might know me from banging your niece  on a pile of your brother's pool equipment.  Or from Salvador.  But tonight, I'm here to take you  behind the scenes on the set of Family Guy.  For the first time ever, you'll see what a typical  production week is like for TV's 11th favorite family.  So please join me as we go  Inside Family Guy.    (INSTRUMENTAL FAMILY GUY THEME SONG PLAYS)  It's certainly not easy being a family  that also happens to star in a sitcom together.  Especially last year, when I discovered  those naked pictures of that 18-year-old intern  on Peter's phone.  But he explained that his phone number  was the old number of-of her ex-boyfriend,  so what was it again?  Oh, the Cloud, that's right.  So the photos were on the Cloud,  and that the-the Cloud pulled the pictures or?  I mean, even if the pictures had not been sent directly to him,  and that's why he has them.  And-and we both called the Apple store,  and they said they can't disprove that it doesn't happen,  so here we are, still married, still on the show.  A-And it's happened five times since then,  and some of the pictures had both Peter and the girl in them.  Being on this show reminds me  of one of my favorite quotes from Macbeth.  WOODS: What's the quote?  (CHUCKLES) Whoa!  I didn't realize this was a trial.  Objection, Your Honor.  Oh, yeah, it's great, you know, doing a show with your family.  'Cause what guy doesn't want to go to his office  and have his family there?  You know, and then you go home after work  and catch up with the family.  - And then, uh, - next day, same thing.  Just trying to make it to the weekend, so you can, uh  spend some time with the family.  Isn't that the dream?  WOODS: Now, I-I understand the show  was quite different when it started.  Yeah, in the original pilot, I was actually the star.  It was called, CHRIS GRIFFIN: Teen Doctor.  Sir, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.  Well, it can't be any worse than what's in here.  (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)  I ad-libbed that line.  I wasn't even supposed to talk.  What they didn't know is that I'd been privately  doing jokes about the newspaper for years.  But, you know, it's not just the Griffins  who work hard to make Family Guy what it is.  Here in the props department,  some sweaty guy is working on the Petercopter.  That's right.  You know, a lot of people don't realize SEAL Team Six  actually completed their mission in this puppy.  Oh, cool, Family Guy!  Over here! I'm down here!  Knock-knock?  Yeah? Hi, Stewie.  Hey, I was just showing the viewers around Family Guy,  and we thought we'd drop in and talk to you about the show.  You want to talk about the show?  I'll talk about the show. The show sucks.  The only reason I stay here is to maintain my profile  for my start-up business, DiscreetCrepe.com.  Hi. Are you a straight, adult male who likes  to eat crepes without people making unwanted assumptions  about your private life?  Go to DiscreetCrepe.com,  place your order, and within 30 minutes  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Very masculine pizza delivery for Stewie Griffin?  Oh, thank you.  Mmm, strawberry-banana Nutella with raspberry drizzle!  Now I just need a guy's butt to eat this off of,  and I got myself a night.  But of course, every episode of Family Guy  starts with the writing.  And here we are the Family Guy writers' room  where the writers are hard at work  with the show's talented cast.  Look, don't get me wrong, guys, I-I think it's hilarious,  and-and I totally get that the sex thing  is what made me popular, but would it kill us  to just once tell a joke that brings glory to God?  Eight years ago, Glenn opened a restaurant where he was  spying on ladies peeing in the bathroom.  As part of the class-action settlement,  he entered rehab, and that's where he found Jesus.  The restaurant was called Sprinklers.  That should've been a tip-off.  He still runs Dumpy's, but I'm pretty sure that one's legit.  WOODS: As the star of the show,  Peter likes to stay involved in the writing process.  All right, butthorns,  which one of you idiots wrote this script?  Uh, I did.  Oh, what'd you write it, like, on a computer?  Yeah.  So you know a lot about computers?  Yeah.  Can you show me how to turn off the flashlight on my phone?  (BEEPS) Don't touch my phone!  And another thing, I read this piece of garbage script.  It's only one page.  That's never gonna cut it.  Uh, that's just the cover.  You can turn the page, like this.  Well, why you hiding all these pages behind the first page?!  What's wrong with them?!  Stand by your work or get out!  Now, spit in each other's mouths.  (WRITERS SPITTING)  You know I'm only tough on you 'cause I hate you, right?  Yeah, over the years, Peter's become just a total nightmare.  I mean, you know, he's not Jim Belushi.  He's not peeing in Snapple bottles on set,  which is, like, a totally real thing.  But he-he's-he's pretty bad.  Dad refuses to interact with any actors on set.  He'll only rehearse with helium balloons  with crudely drawn faces on them.  I'm sorry, Meg, but you're grounded.  MEG: But, Dad, the prom is tonight. Over.  (STATIC CRACKLES)  LOIS: You heard your father, Meg. Over.  (STATIC CRACKLES) (KNOCKING)  JOE: Peter, you ready to hit the Drunken Clam?  Over. (STATIC CRACKLES)  It's difficult having to give up my chair for the balloon.  But that's the business we call ""show.""  Excuse me, Joe.  The Fat Man's behavior has been deteriorating  for quite some time.  And I think someone may have  placed an anonymous phone call to the network about it.  STEWIE (FALSETTO):  Word around the stage is they've decided to finally fire Peter  and replace him with another actor.  And this time, it's permanent.  Not like when we killed off Brian for a few episodes,  so he could shoot that crappy movie what was it?  It was a remake of Old Yeller where the dog  gets the drop on him and kills him first.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry.  (GRUNTING)  They miscalculated the number of dogs who buy movie tickets.  It's actually pretty awkward.  I mean, Dad's the only one in the whole production  who doesn't know he's being fired.  But he'll find out tomorrow at the table read.  This is how we did that.  Bet you didn't know.  (LOW, INDISTINCT CHATTER)  The table read is where the Family Guy cast reads aloud  that week's script to see how the story  and the jokes are working.  And where Peter will learn he's being written off the show.  Okay, everybody, welcome to the table read for this week's  episode, entitled, ""Peter Dies (We're Really Serious, No Joke,  He's Dead and Never Coming Back).""  Oh, and there's other pages. You got to turn them.  Here, let me show you.  ""Interior, Griffins' living room, day.  ""Brian, Meg and Chris watch TV.  Lois enters, upset.""  You guys, I have terrible news!  Your father is dead.  He was shot in the head while killing himself.  I suppose he had his demons.  And his enemies.  Wait, I'm I'm what?  Oh-oh, I know.  Stewie's gonna fire up his time machine and undo this.  DIRECTOR: ""Stewie enters.""  Brian, bad news.  My time machine got a virus  that causes Dad to die again if it's ever used.  Oh, wait, you know what?  I-I bet this is all Chris' dream.  Wow, I am wide awake!  Okay, but there's no way this is real.  They'd have to bring in someone to replace me.  ""Uncle Ricky, played by sitcom buzzard  David Spade, enters.""  Hi, everybody.  ALL: Uncle Ricky!  Hey guys, a time period called.  They want an object back.  (LAUGHTER)  Aw, do we have to go to Dad's funeral?  Let's just play with Uncle Ricky instead.  ""The family cheers.  They do not miss Peter.""  I'm sorry, Peter, but the production  just can't deal with all your nonsense anymore.  We're letting you go.  Oh, please, don't do this!  I'm begging you, just give me one more chance!  (SIGHS) Okay, fine.  (BLEEP)  All right, that's it, you're fired!  And you guys are all okay with this?!  I'm sorry, sweetheart.  This is painful for all of us,  but we just don't see another option.  Yeah, Peter, we love you,  and-and you're still part of the family,  just not part of the show.  Look, I don't know who brought this on,  but maybe it's for the best.  All right, fine, you bastards can fire me,  but at least I'm leaving with my dignity.    Have a good life, Mr. G.  Your penis is out.  Welcome back to Inside Family Guy.  I'm your host and angel investor to the Fappening,  James Woods.  Boy, we picked quite a week to document  the production of a Family Guy episode.  Yesterday, Peter Griffin was fired from the show  and replaced by David Spade.  Given this surprising development,  we decided to follow Peter, and see if our cameras  could capture his story, as well.  We caught up with Peter at Hollywood's legendary  Chateau Marmont Hotel, where I once engaged  in the consensual murder of an underaged prostitute.  WOODS: So, what's your plan?  Are you going to be staying here for awhile?  Yeah, well, I figured if my family doesn't want me  on the show, there's no reason I should keep living with them.  I-I mean, there's no hard feelings, um, I just feel like  this is best for me, and this is best for those cancerous dicks.  And what's next for Peter Griffin?  Well, starting tomorrow, I'm getting back out there.  I already got an audition to be the caring dad  for a Cheerios commercial.  Hey, Dad?  Yeah, bud?  When you were a kid,  what did you want to be when you grew up?  Well, I wanted to be a rock star.  Why didn't you become one?  'Cause of you, bud.  I smiled at one girl in a cell phone store,  and now here I am, stuck eating cereal  for dinner with a kid.  You'll always be a rock star to me, Dad.  You ruined my life.  I'm going to bed.  (FUNKY BASS MUSIC PLAYS)  Wednesdays are rehearsal days here at Family Guy  and the first rehearsal with David Spade  appears to be going very well.  ""Uncle Ricky,  what are all these strippers doing in our house?""  ""Uh each other?""  Hmm?  (LAUGHS)  Oh, my God!  (LAUGHING): I'm sorry, I just  (LAUGHS)  Did you see the way he smirked?  He's like a naughty 53-year-old boy.  Who is this guy?  I'm not familiar with him.  That's David Spade from Just Shoot Me!  I don't know that one.  He was in Grown Ups, Joe Dirt,  Saturday Night Live.  Saturday what how?  And he was also in some movie called Senseless.  With Marlon Wayans?  Oh, yeah, he played Scott Thorpe.  Donna, I'm here with Scott Thorpe.  That's right, from Senseless.  Yeah, I got to be honest, I'm having a blast.  You know, now that I'm not tied down by the show,  it's given me more time to pursue my true passion:  weaving sexually explicit tapestries  featuring the Minions.  Did you have any questions about the artist?  Thursdays at Family Guy are reserved for shooting  all those flashbacks and cutaway gags we love so much,  and what most people don't know  is that all these gags are directed by James Cameron.  What's that?  I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES)  Apparently, I misread the cue card.  They're directed by James, the cameraman.  Tell us, how'd you get the gig?  I sell Vicodin to some of the producers.  What a wonderful Hollywood story.  You know, many viewers think our cutaways  are just whipped together, but they actually  go through a rigorous testing process before filming.  This is the planet Jew-piter,  and he could say, ""Next year is my star mitzvah.""  (LAUGHS)  They love it.  Tell the director. Where is he?  It says don't take it with alcohol,  but you should take it with alcohol.  Yeah, duh.  I also need a couple for the girl I'm babysitting.  Meanwhile, David Spade is making lots of friends on set.  Yeah, I'll definitely talk to the writers.  I agree, there's a lot about your character  that's still untapped.  Okay, thank you, because,  like, yes, I'm greased-up  and, yes, I'm deaf, but what else am I?  Totally.  Thanks, man.  DIRECTOR: Okay, we're ready for you.  (HIGH-PITCHED VOICE): I'll be right there.  Who's the new kid?  Hot-chee-wawa!  Unfortunately, things aren't going quite so well for Peter.  (PHONE RINGS)  Yeah, it's an '09, fully loaded, extra cool A/C.  Great.  I just made $500 flipping a Honda.  All I did was Armor-All the dash.  Boom.  (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)  Hey, any mail for me?  Yes, your death threats to Grimace  have all been returned.  Well, has the Shamrock Shake period been extended?  I believe that's still seasonal,  but while I have you, your bill remains unpaid,  and we saw you selling our robes on eBay.  I'm afraid we're evicting you from the hotel.  What's your home address?  I'm sorry, sir.  Now do you want to leave the regular way,  or do you want our Uncle Phil to throw you out?  I think you know what I want.  (SHOUTS)  (STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)  (DISTANT SIREN WAILING)  (HINGES CREAKING)  Door was unlocked.  I'm sure that's fine.  Well, this seems like a really cheery place,  and looks like some guy named Brooks was here,  and I think this is gonna work out just great.  WOODS: You don't miss your show or your family at all?  Of course I miss my family  but everything comes to an end eventually, a-and you just  you just got to keep moving forward.  Are you gonna be all right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I-in fact, I was just about to melt some cheese on chips  if you want to stay for a sad, single guy dinner.  You going oven or microwave?  Uh, microwave.  I don't know how to turn on the oven.  Those, uh, chips are gonna be chewy, Peter.  Friday night is tape night here at Family Guy,  but tonight they'll be filming the show without Peter Griffin.  I have to admit, it's a little strange  taping a show without Peter.  It-it just doesn't feel right.  I'm especially going to miss the Fat Man's bit  with the audience where he fires  the T-shirt cannon at his own head.  You know he once tried to hold up a store with that thing?  (BELL JINGLES) All right, everybody on the floor.  Empty the register.  Please, don't do this!  Oh, yeah?  You want to be a hero?  Here's what happens to heroes.  Anybody else want to be a hero?  Ooh, me, me, me!  Over here! Over here!  And with regard to Peter's replacement, well,  as his parents and previous co-stars have learned,  a little of David Spade goes a long way.  David, the line is, ""What's for dinner?""  Go again.  What's for dinner?  Hmm?  (SIGHS)  Okay, we can trim that in editing.  He's getting on people's nerves.  I mean, there's only so many jars I can open for one man.  DAVID: Lois, I want pickles!  Coming!  He has tiny hands but when one of my rings  went down the drain, he got it right out.  WOODS: Meanwhile, Peter has wound up  here at the Chinese Theatre, where panhandlers  dress up like iconic movie characters  and charge tourists for photos.  It's even seedier than it sounds.  Step right up, get your picture taken  with beloved comic icon, Little Lotta.  Just two dollars.  Who are you?  Uh, Little Lotta?  She was friends with Audrey and Dot.  Never heard of her.  (GROANS)  (EXCITED CHATTERING, CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)  That's it. Screw this.  I am taking back my TV show and my family.  Ah, we just missed her.  Hey, Smitty, I'm here to get my show back.  I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin, but we have specific orders  not to let you onto the lot.  Seriously?  Well, I suppose, you could come inside  if you had an idea for a show  the heads of the network wanted to buy.  Bumblr with a Tumblr.  So, you see, he's got  a Tumblr account and he's clumsy.  We really like the idea that the words rhyme.  Absolutely, but just a thought:  what if he doesn't bumble?  Um I-I guess so.  And are we married to the Tumblr account?  They bought the pitch, but, um, after a series of network notes,  Bumblr with a Tumblr eventually aired as Bamblr with a Famblr,  which made sense to nobody and is now in its third season.  It did also get me on the lot.  All right, stop the show!  Dad!  That's right, I'm back!  And, Chris, I brought you a T-shirt of Kermit the Frog  acting like a hip-hop guy.  That's so dope.  Don't put it on. It'll fall apart,  but listen, everybody, I realized something.  I've been a real jerk to you guys, and to all  the union fat asses that I assume do something  to keep this thing going.  The fact is, I got too big for my britches,  but I know now that I'm nothing without all of you.  Aw, that's nice of you to say.  Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand,  and if you guys can find it in your hearts to take me back,  well, then I promise that every day I'll prove to you  how much the show, and how much my family, means to me.  Oh, Peter.  Of course we'll take you back.  Oh, welcome back, buddy.  We missed you so much.  My online poker problem is burning like a wildfire.  Well, there's only one problem.  What's that?  What are we gonna do about David Spade?  Don't worry, I already took care of that.  I got SofÃ­a Vergara deported.  Hey, everyone, cuchi, cuchi.  I'm your mother now.  So, all right, let's do a show.  Oh, wait, if my character's still alive,  that means we don't have a script to shoot.  Oh, look at this.  We just happen to have  a whole extra script right here.  ""Pete, Don't Fail Me Now.""  (GASPS)  Sounds like I might be a teacher.  Oh, I have a goatee up till the first commercial,  and then I'm a teacher.  Every week, Peter becomes a diva  so the writers write a fake script, killing him off.  He storms out, then by Friday's taping,  comes crawling back, and we shoot the real script.  Of course, he always forgets by Monday,  and then he becomes a pain in the ass again.  Does it bother me that he does this every week?  Uh, why don't you ask my Camaro?  WOODS: So, I guess this actually was a very typical week  on the set of Family Guy.  Thanks for joining us.  I'm James Woods, and we'll close tonight with a supercut  of every time in the show's history that Peter got hit  in the crotch with a bag of nickels.  Ow!  (GRUNTS)  (GROANS)  Damn it.  Oh!  (ALL LAUGHING)  Why?!  Hey, Lois, you should do  that thing that I like (SHOUTS)  Hey, kids, have you seen my wallet?  Oh, nickels!  Son of a bitch!  PETER: Uh, ladies and gentlemen,  we have now reached our cruising  Ah, damn it!  Boy, can't beat this weather  (SHOUTS) Who is that kid?  (GRUNTS)  Hello?  Uh, hang on, I'll check.  Phone call for ""a bag of nickels""?  (SHOUTS)  (GROANS)  At least he was alone.  They usually travel in threes.  Ow! Crap.  B-B-B-Bird, bird, bird, b-b-b-bird   Ah, nickels!  (SHOUTS)  (GROANS)  Oh, damn it!  Do you think I'm ever gonna be able to have  (GRUNTS) (LAUGHS)  Ow!"

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Peter, I need you to take Chris and Meg to school.  Today's the day I finally kill that squirrel  that's been eating our tomatoes.  Try to get, like, eight of them this time.  I want to make bruschetta.  Oh, can't the kids just walk?  You know I like to watch two full movies before I go to work.  No, Peter, they can't walk, it's three miles.  (SIGHS) Fine, I'll take them.  But you better keep those goggles  'cause I'm gonna put them to good use tonight.  (POWER SAW BUZZING LOUDLY)  Once the floor is full of sawdust,  we can eat peanuts in here.  Dad, are you sure it's okay that we took Brian's car?  Yeah, it's his own fault.  He's the one who keeps his key in the visor  like a carefree hillbilly.  Okay, everybody out.  I don't want the cool kids to know I'm your dad.  Hey, Chris.  Guess who I just scored as my date to the homecoming dance.  - Vice Principal McGuire. - Really?  Yeah, her husband just died of ALS,  so she is ready to get at it.  Hey there, strong guy.  Not now, Brenda!  She says I have the body of a 50-year-old before it gets ALS.  So who are you gonna go with?  I was thinking of asking Kara Morris.  Why don't you ask her now?  Her locker's right over there.  Um y uh, yeah, okay.  Hi, Kara.  I was wondering, um, if you'd like to go  to the homecoming dance with me?  Oh, hi, robot from Big Hero 6.  No, but thank you.  His name is Baymax, you gorgeous moron!  All right, red light.  Time to text and shave and whittle and floss.  (RAZOR BUZZING)  - Thanks for getting here so quickly. - What?  I'm sorry. You're in a Prius.  I just assumed you were my Uber.  I don't know what that is on account of being dull.  Uber it's like a cab except it feels like a game  'cause it's from your phone.  Anyway, I'm late for a meeting.  Can I just give you 20 bucks to drop me off?  Wow, 20 bucks just to drive you across town?  Maybe I should be an Uber driver.  I mean, I could use the extra money.  And it's got to be easier than when I was delivering pizzas.  All right, push. Push.  Come on, come on, almost there.  Almost there, just one more push.  Here it is!  Oh, it's half Hawaiian.  I believe that's ours.  You poor fool.  (GRUNTING)  Hey, Stewie.  What's up, big guy?  None of the girls at school want to go to homecoming with me.  Probably 'cause everyone calls me names like ""Big Nips""  and ""Fat Nips"" and ""Big Fat Nips.""  Oh, don't listen to them, Big Fat Nips.  They're just being haters.  What's a ""hater""?  Oh, it's just something people say  instead of working to change their own flaws.  Anyway, you just got to do what Taylor Swift does  and shake it off.  Who's Taylor Swift?  Oh, my God!  Am I about to introduce you to Taylor Swift?  W-What is she, a singer?  She's much more than a singer, Chris.  She's she's she's the queen!  A goddess!  A gazelle in a high-waisted swimsuit!  Uh, sorry, if you're neither insane,  nor clowns, nor a posse, I'm not interested.  I have an idea.  You should ask Taylor Swift to the homecoming dance!  What? Why would she go to a dance with me?  I'm telling you, this is exactly the kind of thing she would do.  She's such a sweetheart.  Oh, I'm going limp.  (MOANS) I'm just gonna lie here moaning,  thinking about Taylor Swift.  (MOANING)  Tay-Tay.  How would I even ask her?  Oh, it's easy. You and I will just make a video  about how sad you are and put it online.  She's very interactive with all her fans.  I guess it's worth a shot.  Of course it is.  If she says yes, you'll surprise everyone,  just like you did on New Year's Eve.  ALL: Three, two, one!  Some animals give me boners!  (BALLOON POPS, ""AULD LANG SYNE"" PLAYING)  Hi. Uh, I'd like to be an Uber driver.  Okay, sure. Welcome aboard.  Don't I don't I need to fill out a form or?  Oh, right, yeah, of course.  ""Name.""  Peter Griffin.  ""Criminal history.""  This section is optional. I will skip this.  And done.  Here you go. Yeah, none of this really matters.  All I need to know is: do you have a car,  a phone and a face?  It's my dog's car.  Oh, and I know you didn't ask,  - but I am quick to anger. - Okay, great.  Now get out there and try to kiss as many ladies as you can.  The record is 60 in a month.  You, sir, are officially an Uber driver.  (BLUETOOTH RINGS, BEEPS)  (SHOUTING GIBBERISH)    This is some good stuff, Chris.  I think it's ready to post.  Actually, Stewie, I changed my mind.  I made my own video and posted it.  What? How could you do that?  Stewie, I didn't want to do all that fancy stuff,  so I just did a video of me speaking from the heart.  You know, telling her how much it would mean  if a girl like her went to homecoming with a guy like me.  I couldn't even stay awake during that description.  (PHONE VIBRATES)  Hey, she already posted a response.  What?!  Hey, Chris Griffin.  I just saw your video,  and I'd love to go to your dance with you.  All right, I got to go eat an ice cream cone.  'Cause us stars are just like you.  Oh, my God!  (BOTH CHATTER EXCITEDLY)  Uh-oh. This means I have an awkward phone call to make.  What? No, no, it was stupid.  What, two guys going to homecoming?  I-I assumed it was a goof this whole time.  Take it out.  I'm ugly and unlovable.  Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.  Our top story tonight,  pop star Taylor Swift is coming to Quahog  to attend a dance with local high-schooler Chris Griffin.  But first we go to commercial while our sports reporter smiles  and spins a football for some reason.  (SPORTS THEME PLAYS)  Wow, Chris, I'm so excited!  You actually have a date with Taylor Swift!  Thanks, Mom. Did I do good?  Can I wear Grandpa's jacket now?  I-I don't know why you always ask for that.  Th-That's not a thing in our family.  Oh, Rupert, I can't believe Taylor Swift  is actually going to be in our house.  I haven't been this excited  since I abused those caffeine pills  to get ready for the big show.  Everything will be fine, as long as I take one of these.  Pills? You actually are taking drugs?  Stewie, give me those.  I can't, Zach! I need them to sing!  (GRUNTING)  I'm so excited, I'm so excited   (CRYING): I'm so scared!  (SOBBING)  Screech is going to stab someone on Christmas.  Oh, Chris, you look so handsome in your tux.  This must be how Meat Loaf looked when he went to the prom.  - (DOORBELL RINGS) - Oh, that must be her!  (EXCITED YELL)  Hi. You must be Chris. I'm Taylor.  (SHOUTS): What's up?!  (CHUCKLES)  It's so nice to finally meet you.  Your video was so sweet.  And I can't wait to go to the dance tonight.  Me, too. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)  Would you like to come in?  Hi. Peter Griffin, leering dad.  Quick question: in ""Shake It Off,""  you invite us to get down to, quote, ""this sick beat.""  Yet the beat you then provide is rather mild.  My question is this: may I lick your legs?  Hi, Taylor. Stewie Griffin. I'm your biggest fan.  I don't mean that like a psycho, I just  I-I'm not, I'm not a psycho!  Oh, you're a cutie.  Okay, so let's talk about Harry Styles.  Now, you don't have to say anything.  I'm just gonna slowly pull out this tape measure,  and you indicate when I should stop.  Okay, here I go.  Still going.  Still going.  Oh, my God, you bitch! Seriously?  Taylor, this is my sister Meg and our dog Brian.  Nice to meet you both.  We're not all so impressed.  I've met Dan Aykroyd.  I'm sorry, uh, which cast member of Hee Haw are you?  Will you be nice!  Okay, well, we should probably go.  It was so nice to meet you all, except for the girl and the dog.  Sorry about my family.  Don't apologize. They seem nice.  Well, you wouldn't say that if you ever saw us at the movies.  All right, we got our popcorn from home,  our soda from home, our snacks from home  and Braveheart.  (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC PLAYING OVER LAPTOP)  - Where you headed? - The airport.  Great. Just a couple of errands and we'll get you there.  (NO AUDIO)  (DOOR BELL JINGLES)  That was one bitch of a class.  Anyways, what time's your flight?  It's in 20 minutes!  Oh, boy, I can't make it in 20 minutes.  I better call you a Lyft.  - Come on, hurry up, get in! - (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)  I hope you like The Offspring.  Let's go!  (GENTLE POP MUSIC PLAYING)  Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!  She's here with him?  You guys, Mr. Buell's taking  a door-open dook in the bathroom!  I hope this isn't too boring for you.  No, this is so cool!  I always sing about high school,  but I've never actually seen one in person.  (UPBEAT SONG BEGINS)  Would you like to dance?  Sure. But you're gonna have to stand back,  like, five and a half feet.  Cool!  You dance like an unattended fire hose.  Wow! It's like your dance tells a whole story.  Right?  You are the only one who's ever gotten that.  Usually people just shove a wallet in my mouth  and call 911.  You know, Chris, I'm having a great time.  You're so cool and down-to-earth.  I like you, too, Taylor.  I was scared meeting a celebrity,  but you're so nice and normal.  I feel totally comfortable around you.  Well, why don't you just kiss her, Griffin?  Sorry, I just smoked a joint with the pickup truck kids.  (FROGS CROAKING, CRICKETS CHIRPING)  That was really fun, Chris.  I hope you don't mind I made the band  pay me a royalty for each of my songs they played.  Of course not.  And I hope you didn't mind  I showed you who every locker belongs to.  No, I thought that was nice.  I've never had a locker.  I just keep my stuff in stupid mansions.  Can I finger you?  Sure!  Hi. I'm Taylor Swift.  I'm famous, but I'm really nice.  Aw, that's one of the best fingerings I've ever had.    What are you working on there, Chris?  Oh, I'm making a collage for Taylor  of some of her favorite things.  Here's flowers and crop tops  and pictures of Kanye West with his mouth shut.  Wow, you two seem to have a wonderful connection.  We do, Mom.  You know, she's the first girl to ever really understand me.  Uh, you guys?  You might want to see this video Bonnie posted on Facebook.  Why are you on Bonnie's Facebook page?  'Cause she's a (BLEEP) smoke-show.    'Cause I know you're   Just blubber in a dress shirt   He licked his armpit   Then ate all my dinner and dessert   Chris Griffin is a pig in every way   Oh, oh   Blubber, blubber, blubber, oh   Blubber, blubber, oh.   Oh, and some animals give him boners.  (BALLOON POPS, ""AULD LANGNG SYNE"" PLAYING)  What the hell?  Why would she do this?  Wait, wait, wait. What's that next video?  (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)  Oh, Daughtry!  I'm a mom, so I love this.  Chris, what happened?  I-I thought you said Taylor had a good time the other night.  We did!  She even let me grab the part of her body  which on others would be a butt.  Wow, look at these comments.  Everyone hates you, Chris.  She's right. Check it out.  You're already a meme.  Aw, man, Chris, this computer is telling me  that you done Swifted up.  Why would she do something like this?  Because this is what Taylor Swift does.  She gets into relationship with guys,  sabotages them, and then writes angry songs about it.  I just wish I could talk to her.  Well, why can't we? She has a house in Rhode Island.  We could go today.  (GASPS) Oh, my God, we can go today!  My schedule is wide-ass open!  Well, we can't just show up there.  Why not? We've done crazier things before.  Remember when we sent that tweet?  All right, you ready?  Freeze!  We're the Internet police!  You guys are going away for a long time.  Hey, what are you in for?  I said Caitlyn Jenner wasn't brave and beautiful.  Brian, there's some bad people in here.  Hey, what's up? I'm just going to Quahog Stadium.  Okay, would you like the AC on or the windows down?  How about both?  (GASPS)  Pretty great, right?  It is! It really is!  Thank you, genius person!  No problem.  Hey, you ever go in a hot tub when it's snowing outside?  Oh What?!  Ms. Swift, your songwriting team is here.  We got a socko tune for you, Taylor.  Hit it, Morty!  (PLAYING OLD-FASHIONED PIANO MUSIC)  Lox and bagels and bagels and lox   I like being a girl.   Okay, one thought.  What if we change ""lox"" to ""boys""  and ""bagels"" to ""problems""?  Oh, that's perfect.  Like when you changed ""pickle it good""  to ""shake it off.""  All right, we got our homework.  Hi, Taylor.  Chris? What are you guys doing here?  I wanted to talk to you.  Your house is way nicer than Anne Murray's.  We broke in there, too.  Taylor, why'd you write that song about me?  I thought we had a real connection.  We do. I really like you, Chris.  I just  I'm sorry. I always do this.  I ruin relationships with nice guys and John Mayer  just so I can write songs about heartbreak and moving on.  But don't you think that's unhealthy?  You're never gonna find a real relationship  if you keep doing this.  Listen, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, Chris.  Let me make it up to you.  Why don't you guys all come to my show tonight as my guests?  Are you serious?!  Backstage with Taylor Swift?  Well, that'll be even cooler than when I was in that remake  of The Princess Bride with Bill Cosby.  Now, one of these has the iocane powder, you see,  and one of them makes you go sleepy-bye with your mouth open.  Hey, pal, where we heading again?  Just go down this dark alley.  What the hell's going on?  This is what we do to Uber drivers in this town.  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTING)  Stop! Stop! Please stop!  The sound of your leather jackets is excruciating!  You can't just buy a phone and become a cab driver!  Please, I have two families!  (GRUNTING)  (CABBIES HISS)  Stay back!  Where-where did you get that?  Judd Hirsch himself.  I was a boy, no more than 11 or 12.  Was on the side of the road.  Man with a hat pulled up next to me.  Said I reminded him of him when he was my age.  I was just a boy husking corn.  Didn't know what it meant.  Of course, we were all husking corn back then  just to keep the lights on.  And you burned my car  while I was telling my fake Judd Hirsch story.  (UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING)  (CROWD CHEERING)  God, I hate everybody who's not backstage.  This next song is a new one.  It's about my boyfriend Chris.    I'm pretty and I'm rich and I'm in love   Me Taylor   I've met the guy that I've been dreaming of   Me Taylor   (CROWD BOOING)  Wow, they hate it.  This stinks!  We like you when you're miserable!  You guys, Mr. Buell's taking a door-open dook in the bathroom!  Why were they being so mean to you?  Well, I guess they're just used to me being sad  and hurt by men.  But I don't care if they like it, Chris.  I'm happy with you.  I'm happy with you, too.  But it doesn't seem like your fans like this  new happy Taylor.  Are you willing to risk losing them  and jeopardize your career and your art just for us?  I think I am.  (CROWD BOOING, CLAMORING)  Oh, well, I don't know if am.  What? What are you saying?  (INHALES DEEPLY) I'm saying that  Taylor Swift, you are a spoiled ostrich-legged,  no talent, big-footed freak.  You pretend to relate to your fans,  but you make your bodyguards carry your purse.  All your songs sound the same.  And your cats aren't that cute.  Thank you, Chris.  This next song is about my dumb ex-boyfriend,  who either mistreated me, cheated on me  or went to massage parlors when I was out of town.  (CROWD CHEERING)  Wow, Chris, that was really nice of you.  Yeah, I guess.  Don't worry, there'll be plenty of girls for you.  No one will ever be close to as good as her,  but we'll find you someone.  What about, like, a motorcycle lady?  You know, like an old gal?  Her grandchildren call her by her first name?  Let's get out of here. I called us an Uber.  (SLURRING): How many tooths is not enough tooths?  Well, kids, your father may have gotten beat up,  but Uber's still a great job  for anyone afraid to sell their blood.  And, Chris, I'm sorry it didn't work out  with you and Taylor Swift.  I think we're all sorry about that, Brian,  but I'm afraid we are out of time.  I would like to thank our guests Taylor Swift,  Chris Griffin, Stewie and Brian,  Cleveland Brown and his band of Brown Renown.  Hey, we'll see you down in Brown Town, huh, Cleveland?  Oh, I ain't even gonna go there, Peter.  (PLAYS SLIDE NOTE)  We apologize to the greased-up deaf guy.  Didn't have time for him tonight,  but let's see if we can get him back next week  when Amanda Peet will be here with stand-up Dom Irrera.  Good night, everybody.

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    ANNOUNCER: We now return to Rational Geographic.  BRITISH NARRATOR: Upon realizing a trip to Africa  would be smelly and gross,  our crew decided to stay in the office.  Aah! Mom, Dad! A bat, a bat!  Oh, my God, there's a bat in the house.  Okay, all-all right, everybody just calm down,  it might just be Grandpa Munster.  Somebody set him up for a funny joke.  Hey, Grandpa,  how did you sleep last night?  Yeah, see, if it was him, he would have said,  ""Like I do every night: upside down.""  Okay. But Peter,  we can't have a bat flying around the house.  We got to do something.  Don't worry, Lois. I'll get rid of it.  It'll be a piece of cake.  Just like my penis enhancement.  I want it to hang down to my knees.  They moved up my knees.  Everybody, I've come up with the perfect plan to catch the bat.  I bought this remote- controlled toy helicopter,  to which I have attached this handgun.  And I tell you, this thing is not easy to fly.  - Peter, that doesn't seem very - Here goes.  Now, I don't have anything to control the trigger with,  so I put it on a timer.  But I don't remember how long I set it  Aah! We're all gonna die!  Okay, so, now the bat has a gun, and the knives I gave him.  What? Why would you give him knives?  I didn't think it would matter.  I was counting on this helicopter thing working.  Peter? Wh-where are you?  What's going on?  PETER: In order to understand the bat,  we must first understand the vampire.  So I watched Interview With the Vampire.  Cast your gaze upon  Lestat.  Peter, you're not a vampire.  Oh? Then why am I clad in velvet pants  tucked into soft leather boots?  And why does my shirt billow so  in the wind of that rotating fan?  Peter, what's really going on?  I'm just tryin' to reinvent my look.  A guy at work said I dress like crap.  Well, you show 'em tomorrow, Peter.  How'd it go?  I was sent home early and labeled a distraction.  They're having a meeting about me tomorrow.  (ALARM BUZZES)  Wha Wh-What's wrong?  Ar-Are we taking a terrible 7:00 a.m. flight?  No no. I realized to catch a bat,  I need to live like a bat. So I got to be up at night.  It's a nocturnal mission, Lois.  Okay, but what are you gonna do?  Well, as everyone knows,  bats watch a ton of Cinemax softcore porn,  so that seems like the place to start.  (WOMAN MOANING)  - A-ha! - (SQUEAKS)  MAN: Welcome back to CNBC's Moneyline.  Oh come on, man, nobody's buyin' that.  You expect me to believe you own stocks?  Bat Industries was up two dollars a share today  in heavy trading.  - Huh. - (SQUEAKING)  Get back here! Damn it!  Aah!  (SQUEAKING CONTINUING)  I got you now, Bat Damon.  I named you Bat Damon.  Aw, now I want you to live.  Aah! Aah! What is it?  - Aah! - Ow!  You can beat me, but I am who I am!  Peter, what the hell did you do to Stewie's hand?  It could be broken.  I didn't mean to. It's just,  sometimes I don't think before I act.  Oh, hey, high-five.  Hey, did you just high-five that sign?  Yeah.  You think differently.  Get in.  PETER: His name was Derek.  But he went by the Prophet when times were good,  or the Law Giver when times were bad.  I moved onto his prayer farm with 45 other members  of the Salvation Star Boys, who died in a mass suicide.  But not me. 'Cause I don't like root beer.  And I only drink what I like.  After it was all over, I called Lois to pick me up.  She was mad.  But she's what Derek calls an Oppressing Doubter.  May the light of Derek's Invincible Diamond  shine through you.  Oh, thank you so much for coming in early, Dr. Hartman.  Oh, no problem.  - Hell, I used to work here. - What?  Good news. Stewie's hand looks fine.  Oh, hey, high-five.  Huh. As long as you're here,  I see Stewie hasn't had his vaccinations yet.  Should we take care of that?  Well, I suppose so.  Oh, but first, I'm required to have you read this pamphlet  about the risks of vaccinations.  God, you are aging so rapidly.  ""Possible side effects:  fever, severe allergic reaction, muscle and joint pain?""  Wait, and this can't be right:  they actually put some of the disease in the shot?  Hey, man, how many questions your lady ask?  Uh, like, a million?  But I don't remember having to read any of this  when Chris and Meg had their vaccinations.  Well, that was before Internet chat rooms  made everybody an expert.  It's a better world now.  I-I don't know about this, Dr. Hartman.  We might need a little bit of time to think this over.  Yeah, 'cause we don't want to make a big mistake.  Like when I peed next to the chatty guy.  (ALARM RINGS)  Hey, man, we should get out of here,  the building's on fire.  Hey, pal, not now, I'm busy.  Anyway, I'll tell you what's on fire, my urethra.  That's the last time I go to a water park,  I'll tell you that much.  Well, that's not completely true,  'cause I have a Groupon, and I'd hate to waste it.  Plus, the truth is, the kids  Oh, my God  I was the chatty guy.  Hey, you guys, is that my laptop?  Yeah, sorry, we were looking something up.  We were going to get Stewie vaccinated,  but now, after our research, we're definitely not.  Ah, no, Lois, don't tell me  you fell for all that anti-vaxxer crap.  It's not crap, Brian.  There's a lot of evidence to suggest there's a link  between vaccinations and autism.  Lois, all that so-called evidence has been debunked.  Listen to some of these ingredients:  ""mercury, thimerosal, aluminum, formaldehyde.""  Lois, deciding not to vaccinate Stewie  is something that affects all of us.  The only reason they work  is that if a critical mass of society gets immunized,  then the diseases won't spread.  Look, Brian, I was skeptical, too,  but then I did some research  and I found some very interesting things  from the leader of the anti-vaccination movement,  Jenny McCarthy.  See? Proof.  Hard to argue with that.  And look at this one.  Glasses.  Case closed.  I can't believe you guys.  Don't you realize you're contributing  to a potential public health disaster  by not vaccinating your child?  That's exactly the point My child.  He's my child,  and nothing matters more than his well-being.  Oh, God, this is going to be a Lois story, isn't it?  Game of Thrones is on, just a reminder.  Yeah, we made this mistake before.  We got the other kids vaccinated,  but Meg still got chicken pox.  Dad, this is acne.  Girl, you nasty.  You realize the vast majority of people think you're wrong.  Well, maybe that's the problem.  We just got to change their minds.  We're gettin' this town to change its mind  about vaccinations.  Yeah. I'm with you.  Just as soon as I finish gettin' the word out  about the one thing more important.  The brothers who made The Matrix are ladies now!  They're ladies!  Just one of 'em?  That's the thing It's both of 'em!  What are the chances?  What are the chances?!  The brothers who made The Matrix are ladies now!  All right, come on, Peter,  I've got all the stuff for our anti-vaccination rally.  I don't believe this.  It's bad enough you guys  aren't vaccinating Stewie.  Now you're trying to convince other people  to make the same reckless choice?  I'm also gonna pet a bunch of dogs without asking.  Don't do that. We don't like that.  Then I'm gonna try and look at their teeth.  Brian, all we want is for parents to have the choice.  Because parents know what's best for their kids.  I hear Sansa finally shows boob in this one.  You do realize they're putting your life in danger  by not getting you immunized.  You could get measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough  Oh, my God, are you serious?  Very serious. Even the tiniest germ  could make you very ill and, left untreated, kill you.  Really?  I'd expect this kind of thing  from the fat man, but not Lois.  Although she did act like a nutcase  that time she went shopping right before Thanksgiving.  Ready for Turkey Day?  (CHUCKLES) Clever.  Don't eat too much turkey tomorrow.  (CHUCKLES) Oh, I won't.  Now, if only the meal would cook itself, huh?  (CACKLES LOUDLY)  (OVER P.A.): Parents of Quahog  and weekend dads playing three minutes of catch,  do you know that the number of childhood vaccines  has tripled in the last generation?  And why is that?  Because heartless corporations make billions of dollars  by foisting garbage and poison upon our children.  We demand that these vaccines  be tested by independent researchers,  not by the companies who make them.  Excuse me, are you the lady selling the bullhorn?  What? No.  I'm over here.  (SIGHS) Damn it.  This doesn't seem to be working.  Well, obviously, Lois.  You can't just go to a park  and list a bunch of boring facts.  You got to spice things up.  Like I did when I was a lounge singer  with uneven lyric density.  This is a song I wrote for my beautiful girlfriend.  Her name is  Kim   I don't understand why your father   Has such problems with us   Kim   Mostly I think it's because   I don't make my car payments on time   But also because I was dating someone else   At the same time as   Kim   Two, three, four,  (RAPIDLY): five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.  Kim   I love you   But mostly I love that you let me eat crackers in the bed   Kim!   Thank you!  (PLAYS FINAL NOTE)  (RHYTHMIC TAPPING)  (RHYTHMIC CLINKING)  (RHYTHMIC ICE RATTLING)  (CLAPS) Eh, that's enough of that.  What the hell?  Peter, is that you on TV right now?  Oh yeah, that's my anti-vaccination PSA.  Hi, I'm a medical guy,  and I'm here to give you the facts about vaccs.  Fact Vaccinations cause autism,  paralysis, and even  death, death, death, death, death, death, death,  death, death, death.  Fact: ""vaccinate"" rhymes with ""masturbate.""  Would you let a doctor do that to your kid?  Fact: I still think Michelle Williams is Carey Mulligan.  Fact!  Medical delivery for badass karate doctor.  Ah yes, those must be the bones and skulls.  (BONES CLATTERING)  I see no boob bones, the victim was a man.  Wow.  SINGER:  Oh, yeah!   ANNOUNCER: Say ""no"" to vaccines.  Paid for with Meg's college fund.  What the hell is all this?  I'm trying to protect myself from all those diseases  I'm not vaccinated against.  Speaking of which, do you have any idea the germs  you routinely track into this house?  From now on I'm going to ask that you wear these shoes  while indoors.  Where'd you get those?  Put 'em on and lick your lips!  Stewie, you might be taking this too far.  Proper hygiene depends on everyone, Brian.  For instance, I've already saran-wrapped Chris.  (MUFFLED): I'm a gas station sandwich!  (DRAMATIC MUSIC ON TV)  We interrupt this program with breaking news.  Childhood vaccination rates in Quahog have dropped  to an all-time low, fueled by a recent media campaign  led by local meddler, Peter Griffin,  shown here in the basket of Henry Thomas' bicycle.  That can't be real, right?  Oh, I knew one of these had to be my house.  Damn it, Peter, thanks to you,  nobody in this town is vaccinating their kids anymore!  Do you even realize the harm you've caused?  Harm? What are you talking about?  I'm making the world a better place.  Like when I was the Instagram police.  (SIREN WAILS, THEN STOPS)  Sorry, lady, got to crop the chotch.  I will take this.  And cutaway complete.  (SIREN WAILS)  Man, there is a lot of bad art in these hallways.  All right, Stewie, see you after school.  Wait a minute, where are all the other kids?  Haven't you heard?  There's been an outbreak of measles.  It's all because everyone stopped vaccinating their kids.  Oh, my God!  And it's not just our school.  Kids all over town are getting sick.  (AIR RAID SIREN BLARES)  OFFICIAL (OVER BULLHORN): Attention! Attention!  What the hell?  (CROWD CLAMORING, SIRENS WAILING)  People of Quahog,  your town is under quarantine.  Until further notice, no one may enter or leave the city.  Oh, that's the guy who bought the bullhorn at the park.  Oh, this is awful.  It's all our fault!  And look, Joe's arguing with a state policeman  over jurisdiction.  Thanks, Swanson, we'll take it from here.  It's a state matter now.  No way, this is my town.  Thanks, guys, the feds will take it from here.  Oh, no, this is my state.  Hi, I'm a crossing guard who can walk,  so I have jurisdiction over all of you.  Must be serious.  They brought in the big guns.  You happy now, Lois?  Because of you, there's a measles epidemic,  and the whole town is quarantined.  Speak for yourself, Brian.  I, for one, am enjoying the indoor family time.  Who's up for another game of hot-breath telephone?  (LOUD, MUMBLED WHISPER)  We're all gonna die!  Chris, you're supposed to whisper that to the next person.  Peter, Brian's right!  We were wrong about everything!  We've got to get to the hospital and get Stewie vaccinated!  Eh, it might be a little too late for that.  I kind of destroyed all the vaccines in town.  (EXPLOSIONS, GLASS SHATTERING)  All right, what else did I have to do today?  Ah, yes, overdose in my apartment.  I better get home.  You destroyed all the vaccines?  Yeah, but it's fine. There's nothing to worry about.  Is anyone else feeling feverish, achy,  and acutely sensitive to light?  Oh, my God, Peter.  Y-you've got measles!  Now, hold on, hold on, before we all freak out,  it might just be full-body herpes.  Wait, you guys, Dad might not have been vaccinated.  Didn't Grandma say he was born in Mexico?  Nobody remembers that, Meg.  We got to keep you away from Stewie.  You'll get him sick.  Oh, my little guy's gonna be fine.  All he needs is a good, old-fashioned game  of hot-breath telephone.  (BREATHY WHISPER): Measles.  (YELLS) I've got to get out of this house,  or I'll be in worse shape than John Goodman!  I've got your EKG here.  How does it look?  Well, it spells out ""Pancakes.""  Oh, okay, so same as last time.  I'm recommending you go on a strict diet immediately.  Nope.  Horses that make it look like I can walk,  take me to Hollywood!  All right, I'm almost done packing.  I've got it down to four bags and a hatbox.  I'm gonna need some help, Rupert.  Rupert?  Ew, that's the tushie thermometer.  Dear God, you're burning up!  I have to get out of here!  I'm sorry, Rupert.  But the situation here has become unbearable.  Like talking to someone with adult braces.  So, yeah, last weekend, Sheila and I took the kids  up to the lake, it was great.  We had great weather, fired up the barbecue,  Sheila's parents came up towards the end of the week  (LOUDLY): When are you gonna get those off?  (WEAKLY): Meg, you must carry on my legacy.  Promise me you'll crop the chotches.  Crop them, Meg!  Crop them all!  LOIS: Peter, Stewie's gone!  I've looked everywhere!  Oh, Lois, I feel a little better.  I think I could keep down deviled eggs.  Lois, what's wrong?  I can't find Stewie.  He must've gotten out of the house.  God knows how far he's gone.  Well, look, there's a Family Circus dotted path.  It'll lead us right to him.  BRIAN: Ah, it's just Billy.  He died of measles.  And here comes Marmaduke to lick up the vomit.  Lucky.  If I can just escape this quarantine  and make it to the next town,  I'll be able to get that vaccine I need.  Stewie! I'm you from the future!  You've got to get the hell out of town before you get sick!  Yeah, I know. That's what I'm doing.  Okay, I'm really here because I know you have glue.  Give me the glue.  (INHALES DEEPLY, THEN MOANS)  Stewie, listen to me,  never, ever do this great thing I love.  There's the bridge out of town!  So we're all there at the Clam,  just kind of making music together,  and then Peter, of course, had to join in  and clap his hands, and I said, ""Eh, that's enough of that.""  (CHUCKLES) Yeah, I kind of run the group.  I'll just have to go around them.  Good Lord.  I hope my shoe doesn't fall to make me realize  how far the drop is.  (SPLASH IN THE DISTANCE)  Oh, my orthotic was in there.  (TIRES SCREECH)  Stewie?  Where are you?  Lois, what's going on?  That's one of my sidekicks' wives.  He says he's in charge of the group, is that true?  No, not in the slightest, but, Joe, Stewie's gone missing.  We can't find him anywhere.  Lois, look!  (GRUNTING)  I don't know if he can hold on much longer.  We got to get him down.  Stewie, hang on!  Mommy's coming!  (TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)  Oh, no, upside-down train!  (YELLS)  - Stewie! - Oh, no!  (CONTINUES YELLING)  Sean Penn?  That's right, two-time Oscar winner Sean Penn.  What are you doing here?  I'm bringing vaccines into your quarantined town.  Any time there's a public health crisis in a third-world land,  I'm there.  Third world? This is Rhode Island.  Oh, really?  Have you seen some of the delis on Federal Hill?  Oh-ho-ho! Rhode Island slam!  Ho-ho! I like you, Sean Penn.  Oh, my God, you saved my baby!  Thank you so mu Oh.  Sean Penn.  You're the one who played that homosexual.  Yeah.  All right, well, I'll take my son now.  I've brought enough vaccines for your whole town.  I hope you've realized that vaccinations are not  a freedom of choice issue, they're a public health issue.  Thanks to them, countless serious diseases, mumps, polio,  smallpox, and rubella, have been all but eradicated.  Like clean water and functional schools,  vaccinations are a human right.  Great, just what I needed, a lecture from liberal Hollywood.  This whole thing has been a lecture from liberal Hollywood.  Well, it's a relief that everyone's been vaccinated,  and the quarantine has been lifted.  Well, I'm just happy that Stewie is healthy,  and only 150 people died, but not anyone we knew personally.  Yeah, I know I sure learned something.  (TAPPING ON WINDOW)  Hey, do you like apples?  Yeah.  Well, I got her number.  How do you like them apples?  Oh, Bat Damon!  You got the best of me again!"

Anyway, I've got some time to kill  before this room is filled with tear gas,  so I thought, ""Why not finally read  some of the classics I never read in high school.""  Here's one right here, The Great Gatsby.  A book by the only respected guy in the world named Scott.  (1920S-ERA JAZZ PLAYING)  STEWIE: It was my first summer staying at the shore,  but I had a feeling that I, Nick ""The Situation"" Carraway,  would fit right in.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING, FROGS CROAKING)  Hey, it's Nick from The Great Gatsby.  I just checked in, and somebody left their teeth here.  I-I don't know, it's just a set of teeth.  I-I guess men's?  No, I'm not putting them anywhere.  You come and get them.  - (LIVELY JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) - Yecch. The neighbors are having a party  with loud jazz music.  Well, at least annoyingly scatting over jazz  hasn't been invented yet.  MAN:  Bop, bop, bop, ba-ba-bah   Boop, boop, boop, doo, boo   Oh, that must have been invented today!    Hey, whose party is this?  I'm not sure. Women aren't allowed to ask questions yet.  So, what's your name?  Madam, you forget yourself.    That's when I first laid eyes on him.  Jay Gatsby.  He was clearly playing with himself through his pocket,  but I pretended not to see.  Hello. Welcome to my party.  Name's Gatsby. Good to meet you, old sport.  Yeah, just a wave is fine.  I-I'm your new neighbor, Nick Carraway.  Oh, I hope we weren't too loud, old sport.  Yeah, this ""old sport"" thing,  is this is this something you're trying out,  - or is this a keeper? - I just met you,  so I want to tell you something very private.  Let's go out to the dock.    I come down here to think every night  and gaze at that green light.  It's where the love of my life lives,  Daisy Buchanan.  Um, I hate to break it to you,  but that light you've been looking at  is a gay gym called The Pump House.  I-I only know that because I saw a coupon that came with my rental.  Um anyway, Daisy's house is over there.  - She's my cousin. - Daisy's your cousin?!  Yeah. Lot of weird coincidences for an American classic, huh?  Wha I have to see her!  Well, I can set that up.  Um, only thing is she's married.  Yeah, and I hear her husband's a real heel.  Whoa-hoa! Language!  But yeah, I'll set it up.  Um, tea tomorrow at my house, 2:00 p.m.  Great. She's she's gonna be there, right?  Yeah. Why wouldn't she be there?  I don't know, I'm just getting a funny vibe from you.  You asked me down to the docks alone,  and you're getting a funny vibe from me?  (BIRDS CHIRPING)  Wow. What an ugly little house.  Oh, yeah, it's not that palace of domestic abuse you live in.  Whassup?  Oh, my God! Is it really you?  Oh, I've missed you, Daisy. You're as beautiful as ever.  You know what else is beautiful?  My bank account. Boom!  - Rich guy. - You're rich now?  - Oh, my God, I love that! - I know, right?  Come on, I'll show you my place.  Oh, you're leaving?  But I made all these deviled eggs.  - You made? - You know what I meant.  Yeah, you made them. Great job.  (DISHES SHATTER)  (DANCE BAND PLAYING MELLOW JAZZ)  You know, one of the best parts of having an enormous mansion  is being able to come out here and get some fresh air.  You know, sometimes I just want to jump off this balcony  and into that pool down there.  So do it.  Yeah, I know, right? Do it! (CHUCKLES)  Yeah. Do it.  I know. I totally should, right? Here I go.  One, two, three  (LAUGHING): Whoa! Can you imagine?  Yeah, I-I can imagine. It would be fun.  - You should do it. - If only it were that easy, right?  It is. It looks deep enough.  It's your pool. It's your house.  - You can do whatever you want. - I know, right?  Ah, you know what? I can't right now.  My pool guy's cleaning it.  Are you going to bone her?  (BAND PLAYING MELLOW JAZZ)  This is amazing!  I've never seen so many shirts.  D-Do you have enough to, you know, throw?  Yeah, you know, they're actually kind of expensive  Ah, there she goes.  Shirt! Shirt! Shirt!  Shirt! Shirt!  Okay, five is good.  Five is-is probably good.  Shirt! Shirt!  (CHUCKLES): Were you, uh  were-were you this crazy when we dated before?  Mm, Gatsby, is it?  I've been hearing about your vast newly acquired wealth  and your attentions to my wife.  So I thought I would have you over  to my equally large and fancy  but imperceptibly more classy mansion  for an awkward dinner.  And, Nick, have you met Jordan?  She plays golf, and is what kids will someday call a ""DUFF.""  Hey, yeah. Nice tam-o'-shanter.  I'll drink your finger bowl if you don't want it.  STEWIE: In the book, I actually go on a few dates with Jordan.  We're gonna skip all that.  Anyway, like I was saying, you're a trash,  'cause you earned your money a little bit more recently than me.  - What are you getting at? - I'm saying I invited you over  and sat you next to my wife to say,  ""Stay away from my wife!""  You know what we should do?  Let's all drunk-drive into Manhattan  and get a hotel room  and have the same conversation we're having here.  I'm starting to think this isn't a very good book.  I'd like to add another bit of pointless confusion  that will make sense later.  Let's everyone drive somebody else's car.  Someone can take my coupe.  I'm riding with Gatsby, I don't care which car.  I'll take someone in Daisy's car.  I don't think Daisy said you could drive her car.  Tom, why don't you take Jay's car?  - Who's Jay? - Gatsby.  Okay, I have never heard anyone call him that.  Look, if you're in your own car you're in the wrong car.  All right, you guys get gas.  I got to talk to this random mechanic's horny wife  about some business.  Wilson? Gonna need to fill 'er up!  Wilson's wife? Fill 'er up? Get it? (LAUGHS)  (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)  I don't know what they do up there,  but they sure do listen to Def Leppard pretty loud.  Gotta photograph, picture of   - (BED SQUEAKING RHYTHMICALLY) - So, seen any good movies lately?  We just saw Woman Tied to Railroad Tracks 5.  Pretty similar to 4.  (BED CONTINUES SQUEAKING) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Wow, looks like you guys are getting a head start  on the Depression here.  (PETER MOANS LOUDLY)  Thanks for stopping by, Mr. Buchanan.  Yeah, sure. Don't tell anyone how bad I look naked.  Have fun raising my bastard.  All right, let's head out.  Wait, but first I want to see  if we're in the funny horn era.  (OLD-FASHIONED HORN): Ah-ooga! Ah-ha! We are!  All right, Gatsby, you think you're so hot?  Let me show you how a classy guy does classy stuff.  Hello, room service? I'd like a bottle  of your second most expensive champagne.  And I'd like your most expensive bottle.  Wow. Walked right into that one.  Okay, fine. Well, then let's see who has higher socks.  Nya-ha!  Whatever, Tom. None of that matters.  Daisy's in love with me.  In fact, she's never loved you.  Oh, is that so?  Well, I hear Gatsby didn't even fight in World War I.  Wait, why is he calling it that?  Is there gonna be another big war?  I'm sorry, Tom.  That's right. I'm in love with Daisy,  and she loves me, old sport.  Would anyone like a deviled egg  from a tea I had several days ago?  Well, that was awful.  But I sure do enjoy driving your car  instead of you driving it,  even though we came in a different car.  Drunk. Don't forget drunk.  You're drunk-driving my car.  Gas and sandwiches!  Get your gas and sandwiches!  (GASPS)  Oh, that must be Tom, since I saw him in that car earlier!  Tom! Tom! It's me!    Oh-ho, no!  Myrtle!  Where will I ever find another woman  with a hotter name than Myrtle?  (SIGHING): All right, pool, do your thing.  You hungover? Uh, a little bit, yeah.  Okay, we're sort of racing to the end here.  And with that, I shall step  slightly out of range.  All right, I'm just gonna take a quick swim.  Oh, my God! Where are the stairs?  There's no stairs! I'm never gonna make it!  You were standing earlier in the day  next to the car that hit my wife.  (GRUNTING, GROANING)    STEWIE: I would soon return to New York a changed man,  because, for me, that will always be the summer  that I finally put my head underwater.  (PANTING): I did it! I did it!  Aw, I wish somebody had seen that.  (QUIETLY): Hi. Me again.  I'm not in that guy's library anymore.  I snuck up to the attic just before the cops busted in.  They're down there now. Look.  Only problem is, I really want to get  to that trunk of costumes in the corner.  On the one hand, I don't want to give away my location.  On the other hand, there might be a pirate hat.  (FLOORBOARD CREAKS)  Hmm, no pirate hat, but I'll make it work.  Argh! I'm a chef aboard a pirate ship!  Now, who be wantin' pancakes?  COP: I think I hear something in the attic.  Oh, crap. While I figure out my options,  here's Huckleberry Finn.    (STILTED): Hi, Huckleberry Finn!  (STILTED): Hi, Tom Sawyer.  You're Tom, I'm Huck.  Everybody good? Yup?  All right, let's do this.  Huckleberry Finn, you get inside this house this minute.  It's Tuesday morning. It's time for church.  Aw, Widow Douglas,  I already been to church three times today.  I want to stay home and play Angry Birds.  (SQUAWKING)  (PIGS SNORTING)  (CHUCKLES) This is addictive.  Hey, I'm your abusive dad,  and I've been drinkin' all day from this here jug.  Oh, my God, is that a jug full of porn?  Hey, Widow Douglas, I want to live with my dad!  Shut your hole!  Now come on, I need to use your pee.  I'm taking a wagon test in the morning.  I wish you wouldn't drink so much.  Stop countin' my drinks!  Now get over here so I can whip you!  Ow! Pap! No!  Yeah, that's right, bitch.  Now it's your turn  (SNORING)  Geez, this is worse than the Widow Douglas' house.  I got to get out of here.  I know. I'll fake my own death.  I just need enough blood to make it look real.  Hey there! You must be Huck.  Great to finally meet you.  I hope you like it here.  I'm gonna stab you for your blood.  Oh, come on! I just got shot in the pool in the last one.  (GROANING)  I can't remember why I needed the blood.  (BIRDS CHIRPING)  (FIRE CRACKLING)  Lord, I'm-a tell ya,  being a slave is a much worse job  than the temp agency made it sound.  You gonna eat all that possum?  I am. My name's Huck Finn.  What's half of your name?  Jim. Nice to meet you.  I'm a runaway slave.  I'm runnin' away 'cause people want me  to wear shoes and comb my hair.  So I guess we got the exact same problem.  (DISTANT WHOOSHING) Hey, what's that sound?  Oh, no! It sounds like  a waterfall!  Hold on!    JIM: We died.  So wait. We didn't die?  I don't know. It's all just jokes.  - Ah! Did you see that? - What?  I just skipped that rock six times!  That's a once-in- a-lifetime skip!  - That's nice. - You don't believe me, do ya?  I believe we've been out here a long time,  and a man's mind begins to play tricks on him.  It happened for real!  I can't believe you didn't see it!  Of course I saw it.  Most amazing damn thing I ever did witness.  But I wasn't gonna tell Huck, 'cause he claimed  he didn't see me hook-shot that apple core  into the garbage from way far away.  Hello, friends.  Why are you so friendly? You con men?  No, we're businessmen.  We're fake-selling the Brooklyn Bridge.  Don't say ""fake-selling.""  We're real-selling the Brooklyn Bridge.  Stop qualifying the selling.  We're just selling the Brooklyn Bridge.  - I'll buy it. - Hold on, now, Huck.  These fellas are con men.  Push off, you grifters.  We don't want to ever see you again.  Fine, we're going!  It's a river we can't control how fast it goes.  We can barely steer!  Sorry.  (ROOSTER CROWING)  Hey, what if it's spelled with an A at the end of it?  Is that okay?  Jim? Jim?  Jim? Jim?  If you're looking for a gym, Ye Olde Pump House is that way.  Can't miss it. Green light on a dock.  Tom Sawyer? What are you doing so far from home?  Rush is playing here tonight.  They wrote a song about me.  Oh. Well, I'm looking for my friend, Jim.  Huck! Great news! I'm free!  You are? That's awesome! When did that happen?  It's just being revealed now,  but it happened hundreds of pages ago.  Oh. Huh. Weird.  (SIGHING): So, uh, what's left to do?  I'll tell you what:  Rush concert!  (INTRO TO ""TOM SAWYER"" PLAYING)  A modern-day warrior, mean, mean stride   Today's Tom Sawyer, mean, mean pride   Hey. I'm Mark Twain.  Pretty cool book, huh?    Well, while I'm being booked and processed downtown,  we have time for one more classic of American literature.  This one's about idiots choking rodents.  I give you Of Mice and Men.  - Read him his rights. - You know what?  I'm like to read 'em myself.  ""Chapter one: eat my ass, pigs.""  Aah! The bones in my nose!  Wow. I remember when this used to be all orange groves.  It's it's currently all orange groves.  Tell me again about our dream, George.  All right, all right.  We're going to open a bed-and-breakfast in the country,  and we won't be afraid to let our guests know  that we are Steelers fans in this house.  - What about the rabbits? - Yeah, we'll have rabbits, too.  But we'll also have a sign in the front that says,  ""Steelers fan parking only.""  And sometimes we'll give our guests a fake hard time.  Like if they're Jets fans, we'll be all like,  (CHUCKLING): ""Okay, I hope you don't get towed.""  But obviously, you know,  of course, we're not gonna tow 'em.  Hey there, strangers.  Welcome to Phelps Ranch.  - People call me Slim. - Ironically, I assume.  Listen, we're looking for field work,  uh, if you need any extra hands.  Well, three of our guys did just get squished,  so we just might. Come on in.  So, have you done this kind of work before?  Have we pulled an object off a plant  and placed it in a burlap bag?  Yes, I think we understand the nuances of this profession.  Good, good. And how about you? Tell me about yourself.  I like to kill animals and then a lady.  I got a good feeling about you guys.  All right, you guys are doing great.  Hey, listen, my dog just had puppies,  and I thought, since you're covered with feces and I barely know you,  I'd give you a delicate, snow-white, newborn puppy.  Okay, just don't give me to Dead-Eyes over there,  'cause I've already been killed twice  in the other two stories, and I don't want  Puppy! Aw, (BLEEP)!  (CRUNCHING)  This puppy doesn't work!  Well, well, well  As you can tell by the ""well, well, well"",  he's the bad guy.  Looks like we got us some new employees.  That's right, Curley, I hired 'em this morning.  Well, tell 'em to get out.  This is where I practice my karate, 'cause I'm a dick.  I understand you like to pick fruit.  You ever pick something bruised and pear-shaped?  Fruit has seeds you can poo out!  Hey, Hodor, stop coming on to my slutty wife!  Look, I can tell by the fact that you wear a single,  Vaseline-filled leather glove that you're a reasonable man.  So, let's all take a deep breath and calm down.  No! Karate chop!  (GRUNTING)  (BONES CRUNCHING)  (YELLS) Damn it!  I tuck my jeans into my boots!  I'll get you, you stupid, giant moron.  Not great timing, I know,  but can I leave early for a dentist appointment?  So, I should be home by 10:00.  It's just this piano-bar-slash-cabaret place  called ""Tinkles.""  Rory told me about it.  Who's Rory?  You remember him.  The field hand who gave me a shoulder ride  back to the house?  That was Rory.  Anyway, it sounds like it's just a hoot.  Wow, maybe you'll meet a pretty lady to get married to there.  Yeah, well, that's the idea.  While you're gone, can I touch myself?  Uh, again, you don't have to schedule that with me.  But remember, if there's any trouble,  we meet by the big tree on the edge of town.  Everything in my head is screaming.  All right, then, I am off.  Well, hello there.  If it isn't the sexy imbecile.  Oh, hi.  Sorry about what I did to your husband earlier.  Yes, that was quite a hand job you did on him.  You know, I'm not so bad at those myself.  I'm not gonna lie to you,  you're wasting your double entendres on me.  (QUIETLY): I want you to destroy me.  Okay!  (BONE SNAPPING)  (PIANO PLAYING ""JEEPERS CREEPERS"")  Jeepers creepers   Where'd you get those peepers   Jeepers creepers   Where'd you get those eyes   (APPLAUSE)  Thank you, thank you.  Oh, I just love a song that explains what it just said.  (INDISTINCT WHISPERING, STEWIE SIGHS)  All right, evidently I have to go to the big tree  on the edge of town to take care of something.  This shouldn't take too long.  Do not take my songs off the list.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  I'm sorry, George, I didn't mean to kill the girl,  and now the whole town's gonna hang me by a rope.  Oh, I would never let that happen.  Thanks.  - Tell me about the rabbits, George. - Yeah, sure thing.  But while I do that, why don't you face away from me  and count the stars.  Okay.  All right, so the B&B will have a rack of single-gear bikes  for every guest, and yes, next to that, of course,  is going to be the big, giant rabbit hutch.  - Buh-bye, Lennie. - (BODY THUDS ON GROUND)  Goodnight, kids.  Good luck with those book reports."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    ANNOUNCER: We now return to Vedder Call Saul.  (TO THE TUNE OF ""EVEN FLOW""):  Hey, Saul   Got into a little trouble and I'm gonna need a lawyer   Hey-ey   Okay, so tell me exactly what happened.  I was driving   Had a bit to drink and then I ran into a milk truck   Yeah-ah   Were you on drugs?  ""E"" and blow.   Turn that off. I'm mad at TV.  Peter, what's wrong?  Family Guy has been around since 1999  and whenever it's time for the Emmys, they don't give us one.  I'm sick of it!  Well, I'm not making another episode with The Simpsons.  What did that get us?  I'll tell you what it got us.  More ink for The Simpsons.  Yeah. ""Simpsons plays down to competition.""  ""Simpsons step into the sewer.""  ""Shame on you, Simpsons.""  Those lucky bastards.  Well, this week, we do classy comedy.  Emmy comedy.  I think that's a great idea.  It's about time we made some quality television  like Modern Family, Girls and Transparent.  That's the spirit.  Griffins, let's make this our Emmy-winning episode.  So get all your pukes and farts out now.  - (FARTING) - (RETCHING)  (LAUGHS)  I mean, I mean, I mean  not funny.    (SALSA MUSIC PLAYING)  Kids, it's me, tu madre, Lois Griffin.  Time for breakfast.  - (MUSIC STOPS) - Oh, yeah.  Good morning, Lois, which is who you are.  My wife, Lois. Hugging my wife.  (GRUNTS)  (DOORBELL CHIMES)  Package for Peter Griffin.  Thank you, unknown delivery woman.  Forget the freaking Emmy.  If you touch her ass, I will  (GASPS) ""Amazon.""  Ay, my Uncle Alejandro lives in the Amazon.  Do you think he has sent us shoes made from banana leaves?  Boy, the, uh, the ethnic characters  on these Emmy-winning shows  aren't exactly rocket scientists, are they?  I don't know what you talkin' about, Liz Lemon.  No, this is something I ordered, for me.  I am a woman and always have been.  I've made plans to undergo surgery  so my wang don't get in the way of the woman what I am.  Ay, dios mio.  Lois, I'll still be a parent to our children.  But now I'll be a trans-parent.  Get it? Transparent?  Clever pun, right?  Please, honor me for my courage.    I think gender-reassignment surgery is very brave  and the fat man should win some kind of award for it.  - The fat woman. - He hasn't chopped it off yet.  That doesn't matter. Peter already identifies as a woman.  And on karaoke night, I identify as George Michael.  That doesn't mean it's true.  Brian's just mad because he has to be the lady one.  Which makes you the one who's gay in real life.  Daddies, I'm standing here, delivering my line  with more emotion and less of a monotone  than the actual Lily on Modern Family.  I'm now confident enough to share my truth  with the rest of my loved ones, beginning with my son, Chris.  Bazinga, Father.  Assuming father is still the appropriate designation.  What-what are you doing?  Waiting for the laugh to die down.  I'm here because I've decided  to become the woman I am inside.  Can you find it in your heart to accept me?  Oh, Dad, science has moved so far past  binary gender construction.  And if being a woman makes you happy,  then in the words of Mr. Spock, ""It's only logical.""  Wow, I couldn't follow any of that,  but look how smart your audience is.  Ha-ha.  Louis C.K.? Is that you?  Yup. I'm a big fan of yours, Peter.  Wow, that's great because if Louis C.K. likes something,  - everyone has to. - That's right.  Well, I'm glad my popularity has cooled off just enough  that you were able to get me to do this.  Bye, Peter.  Boy, he's not afraid to go there, I'm told.    - Norm! - Norm!  Ative gender roles have been turned upside down.  Correct, Quagmire.  I'm going in for gender-reassignment surgery.  What the hell, Peter?!  First my dad and now you?  Am-am I is it am I doing this to people?  Is it do you guys feel like cutting off your penises?  No, but I can turn it inside out like rolling up a dress sock.  You guys aren't supporting my choice?  Well, what do you expect, Peter?  I-I mean a sex change operation?  Why are you doing this?  I'll tell you why I'm doing all of this.  For me.  M-E. M-E.  I'm doing it for M-E.  (CRYING)  Ew. I mean, yay!  (CRYING)  Man or woman, I'm a big fat joke.  No one takes me seriously.  MEG: I do, Dad.  You've inspired me to nakedly eat this cake in a weird place.  Thanks to you, I now believe in me.  Me.  M-E.  I believe in M-E.  (CHUCKLING): Okay, okay, all right.  Don't want one that bad.  Peter, I'd like to introduce the surgeon  who will perform your procedure today.  Dr. Wang Gon.  Wow, I can't believe all you guys came out to support me.  You guys aren't just the best friends I've ever had.  You're also the best comedy.  - Aw. - Aw.  Great job, everyone.  If that don't get us the Emmy, nothing will.  Where do you think you're going?  Doc, I'm not actually going through with the operation.  I'm going home.  We're doing this whether you like it or not.  (BOTH GRUNTING)  Doc, no. Stop him! Somebody help!  You want the Emmy, don't you?  PETER: And that is how I became your mother.  So, the Emmy committee  watched our submission for Best Comedy?  Uh-huh.  All right, thank you.  They hated it so much, they gave us a negative Emmy.  We now owe them an Emmy.  (ALL GROAN)  The Emmys aren't fair.  I mean, shows like Nurse Jackie are basically dramas,  but they get comedy awards all the time.  (GASPS) That's it.  We'll sneak into the drama category.  That's how we'll win the Emmy with dark, confusing plot twists  like on Homeland or Mad Men.  Ooh, or Breaking Bad.  Or Mr. Robot Chicken.  No, Chris, it's Mr. Robot.  - Chicken. - Mr. Robot.  - Chicken! - No, no, Chris, you see,  Mr. Robot is a critically acclaimed show.  Robot Chicken is something kids used to watch in 2006.  It's basically four minutes of nonsense  on at 1:00 in the morning breaking up personal injury ads.  Chicken.  - (GUNSHOT) - (CROWS CAWING)  (PANTING)  MAN: Please, don't.  Why won't  you die?!  (CROWS CAWING)    Shh.  Shh, that's right.  I'm your dad.  Your gentle, suburban dad.  Oh, what a twist. Shh.  Hey, Dad.  Sure must be tough having a son  with goofy noodle legs like mine.  Chris, I love you  no matter how useless you are in a paddleboat.  (CROWS CAWING)  Peter, those crows keep getting in.  This whole house is falling apart.  It's okay, my long-suffering, quietly dissatisfied wife.  We'll get everything repaired.  How? We can't afford it.  We have to pay for Chris's doctor bills  and meds for our daughter in the CIA.  (FLAPPING LIPS)  Damn, she's good at her job.  How are we ever gonna pay all these bills  that have been perfectly ripped across the top  so the words ""past due"" are visible?  Oh, I just thank God  there's no devastating turn of events going on  that I don't know about.    - You have cancer. - How long do I have to live?  One week.  While I give the rest of your diagnosis,  I'm going to gradually talk quieter,  (QUIETLY): as if I'm growing distant  to show how overwhelmed you are by this news.  (EARS RINGING)  (BEES BUZZING)  (SILLY CARTOON NOISES PLAYING)  (""AH-OO-GAH"" CAR HORN HONKING)  Yo, you five-o?  No, I'm 87.  But how flattering.  Now, get me drugs, scummy drug dealer.  You got it, mayor of our city.  Mm. I wonder which of us is the bigger criminal.  Oh, that's easy. You are.  Hey, can you teach me to sell drugs?  Hold up. Are you wearing a The Wire?  No. I need money for sympathetic reasons  and I have no other option than crime.  I mean, I could sell stuff on eBay, but shipping.  Well, I am pulling a heist at a meth lab.  I suppose I could use the help.  Great! You won't regret this.  When it comes to selling drugs,  you and me will be a better team  than the old lady's eyeballs on Downton Abbey.  I'm looking way over in this direction.  And I'm looking way over here.  That way we can see all the awards flying at us.  Here comes one now.  Best Cutaway.  (""DOWNTON ABBEY: THE SUITE"" BY JOHN LUNN PLAYING)  (APPLAUSE)  Remember, kill anything that moves.  - Even a kid? - Especially a kid.  You got to kill a kid at least once a season to make people go,  ""Oh, I can't believe they killed a kid.""  Let's go.  (BOTH YELLING)    Wait, we did this already.  G-Go back.  Or-Or forward?  I'm-I'm lost.      (GRUNTS)  (GUNFIRE CONTINUES)  (GUN CLICKS)  I'll get help!  (MUTTERING QUIETLY)  (PHONE VIBRATES)  (GASPS) Brian, call off this drone strike,  Dad needs us.  Damn it, Meg, we're about to take out the head of ISIS!  Hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!  - Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! - Okay, you've made your point.  You're lucky you're so good at your job.  Wha?  (MEN SCREAMING)  (SIZZLING)  That was badass how it went from the guy burning up  to the barbecue, right? Best Director.  Hey, Peter, I was thinking about this Emmy thing.  What's the most acclaimed drama of all time?  - The Sopranos. - Right.  And what's the most memorable moment  - in the history of that show? - Well, I'd have to say    JOE: Nice briefcase full of cash.  Where'd you get the money for a briefcase like that, Peter?  I want in.  I need the money to pay off my mysterious boss, Mr. Robot.  CHRIS: Chicken!  Chris, get back in the house!  (IN SOUTHERN ACCENT): My whole plan,  fallin' apart like a House of Cards.  You know, growing up in Gaffney,  my daddy always said, ""Turn the other cheek.""  Kevin Spacey always said,  ""I was just walkin' my dog in that park at 3:00 a.m.""  I don't trust either one of 'em.  I suppose it's time to tell my wife the truth.  Like a man.  (SOBBING)  (GASPING): And then, I sold all the drugs  'cause the doctor said I had the cancer  and I killed the guys,  and Joe took all the mon the money!  (CONTINUES SOBBING)  I see.  Are are you leavin' me?  No, Peter.  I'm helping you kill that cop.  Because I'm darker than you and the audience ever thought!  What a twist.  For five long years, orange was my new black.  (SLOBBERING)  Peter, I don't care if it's drug money.  I have grown accustomed to Hulu Plus.  If you think I'm going back to regular Hulu, you're crazy!  We don't even watch that much Hulu.  I still want it just in case!  Now take off all your clothes so we don't get blood on 'em  when we kill that cop in the desert.  Oh, the beginning all makes sense now.        (PANTING)  Why won't you die?!  (CROWS CAWING)    (BOTH SCREAM)  (ROARS)    Whoa!  I did not see that coming.  One more. Let's watch one more.  Well, hold on.  Like all television viewers,  our first priority before deciding  to continue watching a show  should be whether or not it features enough diversity.  I felt very well-represented.  Aw, I'm glad, honey.  Mmm.  Hey, thanks for letting me come over, you guys.  (KNOCKS ON DOOR)  Telegram for Mr. Griffin.  Thank you, someone's nephew.  Would you mind reading it out loud  for maximum old-timey effect?  ""To P. Griffin, from the Emmy Board of Governors.  Dear Mr. Griffin, stop.  We understand you've been attempting to win an Emmy, stop.  - Stop, stop."" - Is that all?  No, there's another from Fleetwood Mac.  ""Don't stop, stop. Thinking about tomorrow, stop.""  And here's one from The Supremes.  ""Stop, stop. In the name of love, stop.""  - Are you finished? - Are you asking me to stop, stop?  Peter, close the door.  Well, that's it.  We didn't get Best Drama either.  This is hopeless. We've tried everything.  No, Lois, we haven't.  But that's just what we're gonna do Everything!  We're gonna try for every single Emmy category.  Starting with Best Stunt Performance.  Aah!  Peter, I don't think that's a category.  Oh, okay.  Best Documentary.  Aah!    (IN WISCONSIN ACCENT): Chris is playing my dummy nephew.  Our family actually lines up really well for this.  Best Competitive Reality Show!    - Peter, you're out. - I'm off the show?  No, your penis is out.  - You're in. - I'm in?  No, urine is running down your leg.  Outstanding Casting for a Comedy Series!  PETER: Okay, so the deal is, I get girls like you jobs.  The jobs pay $1,000 to $5,000 a day.  I'm recording this interview.  And then I send the demo tape to producers,  and if they like you, they're gonna hire you.  Have you done anything like this before?  Never. This is my first time.  All right, now, a lot of these scenes are gonna be  you interacting with someone else,  so I'll just come around and read with you.  Now, since I'm holding the camera,  I'm gonna need some help with my belt buckle.  And there you have it, Family Guy reaches a new low  as it grovels and begs for a meaningless award.  I would say they've got about as much chance of winning an Emmy  as the Republican Party has of accomplishing something.  (AUDIENCE LAUGHS AND CLAPS)  MAN: Peter, over here.    Bill Maher? What are you doing not smirking outside a church?  Uh, yeah, I was just doing that.  Uh, look, Peter, I'm here for two reasons:  first, to find out who that Asian girl was on the couch,  and second, to tell you that  Family Guy will never, ever win an Emmy.  Okay, first of all, that was Asa Akira.  I think you knew that.  Second, are you sayin' there's a conspiracy against us?  (WHISPERS): Follow the Emmy.    (LIGHTNING CRACKLES)  (THUNDER RUMBLES OUTSIDE)  It's back this way.  And who was that Asian girl on the couch?  I think you knew who that was.      (TRILLING)  To convey this moment of shock  at the depth of the conspiracy around me,  here's Ryan O'Neal in the movie Tough Guys Don't Dance.  - (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS) - Oh, man.  Oh, God. Oh, man.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Oh, God. Oh, man.  Oh, God. Oh, man. Oh, God!  (TIRES SQUEAK)  Peter, there you are.  I've been calling you all night.  Where the hell have you been?  No time to explain.  This Emmy thing goes deep.  The same people win year after year after year.  It's like there's some kind of secret society  that takes all the awards and is keepin' us from getting one.  Yeah, I know. They're all here to see you.  - Hello, Peter. - (GASPS)  The Michelin Man?  You're part of this?  No, I'm two-time Emmy-winner Alec Baldwin.  Peter, stop snooping around the Emmys.  Yeah, butt out. It's none of your business.  Well, why not, Julie Bowen?  Huge fan, by the way. Just huge.  What are you hiding?  What's the big, secret reason  Family Guy can't win an Emmy?  All right, we'll tell you.  Your show sucks.  Peter, I'm famous writer Aaron Sorkin.  Walk and talk with me.  You wouldn't know my work because  I don't write for Juggs magazine.  Let me explain ""writing"" to you.  You can't take a scene from Ferris Bueller,  cross out the name ""Ferris,"" and replace it with ""Peter.""  And the racial stuff on your show is just embarrassing.  You have people of color voiced by white actors.  - No! - Yes!  Hell, I'm Shonda Rhimes,  and I'm being voiced by a white actor.  And worst of all,  you take this big pile of garbage,  and you tie it all up by having everyone sit around saying,  ""At least everything's back to normal,""  as if something happened.  When nothing happened!  It was a complete waste of everyone's time!  (SAD MUSIC PLAYS)  Well, I'm glad all this Emmy nonsense is over  and things are back to normal.  Yeah, me, too.  You know, I may not get Emmys,  but I do get the best award of all My family.  And this e-mail from a young fan.  ""Dear sir, your show helped me  when I was going through chemotherapy.""  Aw.  ""My favorite episode was when Homer stays home from church""  Ah, damn it, he thinks we're The Simpsons.  Hey, what do you say, one last try?  Why not?  Ladies and gentlemen,  please enjoy this spectacular, live-action chicken fight,  starring Ty Burrell.  Good night!  (WEAK CHIRPING)  Shh. Shh.

Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    (FOOD SIZZLING)  Wow, you guys.  I've never been to a restaurant where they cook  right in front of you.  Ugh. You know, later we're going to have to take  one of those forced happiness family photos  that come in the restaurant's tacky frame.  Why are you so (BLEEP) negative all the time?  I uh wha I don't uh, what?  Come on, you guys, relax.  Let's have a fun night.  We haven't done anything as a family  since we sat courtside at that NBA game.  (SNEAKERS SQUEAKING ON COURT, CROWD GASPS)  You okay? You guys, okay?  Great seats.  Yeah, it's a whole different game when you sit down here.  Huh, ""samurai"" or ""geishas.""  Which one am I?  I'll just wait till somebody else goes in.  Well, that wasn't helpful.  Hmm, this one's holding a fan.  That's usually what I need when I'm done in a bathroom.  Oop, no urinals.  Must've guessed wrong.  Wow, look at this place.  There's candles, hand lotion.  Whoa, there's not even any swastikas  carved into the toilet seat.  And it's so peaceful.  I haven't heard a guy's booming fart  the whole time I've been in here.  I feel more relaxed than a chick on Facebook  with her legs in front of a pool.  - (NOTIFICATIONS BEEPING) -       All right, Lois, I'm off to the mall.  I'll be back in about 20 minutes.  Oh, what are you gonna buy?  Nothing. After the other night, I made a decision:  from now on, I'm only using women's restrooms.  What? You can't do that. You're a man.  You'll get in trouble.  Oh, I got that covered.  I'm going to Anthropologie.  I'll just ask them for something so ridiculous,  they'll have to check in the back for it.  And then I'll sneak into their ladies' room.  Yes, I'd like a $4,000 ping-pong table  that's shaped like Easter Islan  We have one right over there.    Okay.  How about a telephone that's made of vintage phone book paper  and doesn't make or receive phone calls or work in any way?  You mean like this one right here?    - Right, but what if I wanted - Sir, sir?  There's nothing you can possibly imagine  that's strange or useless enough that we don't have it  here at Anthropologie.  I know one thing you don't have, black customers.  Ah! I'm melting!  Ha-ha! To the ladies' room!  Wow, this is the nicest one yet.    Eh, what are the odds she's gonna show up?  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)  (WOMAN CLEARS THROAT)  Did you get your ass kicked by Meryl Streep?  No, it was just some low-class cockney woman  from the mid-1800s and (GASPS)  Bravo!  She is amazing.  (MERYL STREEP'S VOICE): Thank you.  Stay out of my crapper.  (APPLAUSE)  And the Oscar goes to  Meryl Streep, for Stay Out of My Crapper.  (TRIUMPHANT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING)  (APPLAUSE)  Ah, the ladies' room at Wimbledon.  This must be the fanciest bathroom in the world.  Uh-oh, looks like these are in use.  (WOMEN GRUNTING BACK AND FORTH)  (GRUNTS LOUDLY)  (APPLAUSE)  Deuce.  Hey, uh, don't tell Mom that we don't use car seats with me.  Unhand me! What do you think you're doing?!  Okay, Stewie, you're gonna help Daddy by holding his iPad  while he watches season one of House of Cards.  (HOUSE OF CARDS THEME MUSIC PLAYING)  Wh where was the house?  Where was the house of cards?  All right, Stewie, time to go.  Whoa, whoa. (CHUCKLES) A little wobbly.  Guess my legs fell asleep.  (YELLS)  Aah!  Stewie, Daddy can't feel his legs. Go get help!  I'm hanging from a door, you idiot!  (YELLS)  (GRUNTS)  By the way, you're down to five percent battery.  Oh, damn it, my head.  Well, no wonder you're running all the apps at once.  (GROANS)  MAN: Sir? Sir, can you hear me?  There he is.  Welcome back, buddy.  - Who are you? - I'm a paramedic.  Name's Stryker Foxx.  (BELL CHIMES)  Oh, Lois just texted.  ""Burgers or meatballs for dinner?""  I'll text back for you.  ""Same thing, bitch. Just different shapes.""  (IPAD CHIMING RAPIDLY)  (CHUCKLES): Oh, this is gonna be fun.  Oh, battery died.  Sir, you've sustained a head injury.  How many chicken fingers am I holding up, and do you want one?  Three, and hell yeah!  Mmm. Aw. These are amazing!  Did I die and go to heaven?  Well, you didn't die, 'cause I saved you.  And you're not in heaven 'cause you're not holding a margarita.  Oh, wait a minute, yes, you are.  You brought a lot of food in the bathroom.  I always do.  Oh, my God.  Are you the coolest guy ever?  Ah, that's just a silly title they gave me  down at the Karate Paintball Dirt Bike Club.  Awesome!  Okay, well, bandaged you up.  You should be good to go.  But just be more careful next time.  I know. What a stupid injury, huh?  I haven't been this embarrassed  since I was a rookie firefighter.  (ALARM RINGING)  PETER: Sorry, first day. Still learning.  Hey, Stryker, wait!  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say thanks again  for patching me up.  No problem, buddy.  Hey, that's an interesting necklace you got there.  Oh, this? It's from when I was a kid.  It's half of a ""best friend"" coin.  I always had this crazy dream  that one day I'd run into the guy with the other half.  Oh, my God. Cody?  Oh, that must be the name of the dead surfer I found this on.  TV ANNOUNCER: We now return to the Olympics.  Ugh, it's so annoying.  They always use football announcers  for events they know nothing about.  ANNOUNCER: The players are ready to take the swimming field.  (ALARM BUZZES)  And they're swimming!  They appear to be doing the forward stroke.  My neighbor has a pool.  I'll take a dip if I know they're on vacation.  It's neck-and-neck, and it looks like Canada won!  Uh, no, they're going back the other way.  What do you think? How do I look?  Like a gas station energy drink.  But you put that on to go to the Clam?  Aren't the guys gonna think you're a little overdressed?  Oh, I'm not hanging out with the guys.  I met someone new.  His name's Stryker and he's really cool.  Like, he's one of those guys whose forearm hair  makes his watch look even cooler.  (PHONE RINGING)  (GASPS) It's Stryker!  I want him to think I was listening to a cool song.  Pump up the jam   Yeah, who dis?  Oh, hey, man.  Oh, nothing much. Just getting slurped.  - Ew. - Oh, you're almost here?  Okay, just, uh, just give me a second  so I can put away all my guitars.  Okay, Seacrest out. Bye.  (MUSIC STOPS)  What the hell was that?  Lay off. Nothing.  (KNOCK ON DOOR)  Hey, Peter.  Hey, man.  Hola, cha-cha, hi-hi.  - Peter! - I don't know. It's-it's this house.  I-I got to get out of this house.  Boy, Dad sure seems excited.  I know. I haven't seen him this giddy  since he discovered that single-loop roller coaster.  (GIGGLES)  Ah  (GIGGLES)  Ah  (GIGGLES)  Ah  Uh, don't feel so good.  (RETCHES) Ew!  Ah  (RETCHES) Ew!  Ah  (RETCHES) Ew!    Wow, what a cool loft.  I bet it cost a ton to make this place look unfinished.  Hey, come over here. There's someone I want  to introduce you to, 1997 George Clooney.  Wow! That's the coolest George Clooney there is!  Hi, George Clooney, second worst Batman.  Peter Griffin, second best Homer.  You may have heard, I'm also known  for my practical jokes on the set.  One time, I nailed Nora Dunn in the head with an apple.  (LAUGHS): That-that's hilarious 'cause you're handsome.  Otherwise, you're just some dick who hit a lady.  Aw, thanks for bringing me here, Stryker.  I'm having the best time ever.  Even better than when I lived in Santa Fe.  Have you ever seen a prettier sunset?  Never.  It's just so peaceful here.  It sure is.  Mm. Sure is.  Did you also have a very public meltdown in another city?  - I did. - Yeah. Yeah.  (KNOCK ON DOOR)  Ugh, it's the guys.  What do those losers want?  Losers? Those are your friends.  Nah, they're lame.  Not one of them has ever vaped at a funeral.  Hey, Peter. Hey, what are you doing tonight?  We're gonna watch Cleveland  put a garbage can full of coins in a Coinstar.  Sometimes it takes my buttons.  Eh, thanks, guys, but I-I can't make it.  I'm, um, I'm getting re-circumcised.  Got a wedding next week.  I just want to clean it up a bit.  Oh, well, that's too bad. Yeah, maybe next time.  That sounds horrible.  Peter, why did you just lie to the guys?  'Cause I got plans with Stryker.  I don't want them to embarrass me.  Eh, I get where he's coming from.  That's why I never introduce you to my friends.  What friends?  Like the guys in my photography club.  ""Dear Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones  and Jared from Subway,  I feel like I'm the only one sending pics.  I love all the positive feedback,  but maybe you guys send a pic?  Anyway, here's more pics.""    Hey, you ever try that? Wingsuiting?  I mean, basically, yeah.  One time, I jumped off a top bunk  with a towel around my neck like a cape.  It was inside the IKEA.  I landed on a cardboard computer.  We should totally do that sometime.  Nah, I can't go back there.  They got my picture by the door.  Hey, he is in here.  What the hell are you guys doing here?  We were coming back from the Coinstar  and saw your car out front.  Rough night. Turns out the can was all buttons.  We're not gonna make our mortgage.  What are you doing here?  I thought you were too busy to go out tonight.  Peter, who are your friends?  Oh, um Stryker, this is Quagmire, Joe and Cleveland.  How do you two know each other?  Did you meet at the Harry Potter store?  Peter loves that place.  It was one wand and I was using a gift certificate.  No, we actually met when I was administering first aid to him.  - I'm a paramedic. - For real?  Hey, can I show you seven or eight things on my body  and ask for medical diagnosises?  This thing here that looks like a second elbow,  I don't know what it is.  Feels like it's filled with liquid.  Well, I could take a look at it.  No, no, no, guys, guys, it's his night off.  I have two pee holes.  Stop it! Stop it. Guys, can I talk to you?  Look, this, this right here  is exactly why I've been avoiding you.  I knew you'd embarrass me in front of Stryker.  Who cares? He's just some dude.  He's not ""just some dude.""  He happens to be the first really cool friend  I've ever had.  What are you talking about? We're cool.  You are absolutely not cool.  Oh, yeah?  Well, then why did those teenagers on the way in say,  ""Cool wheelchair, dick""?  Hey, look, Peter, if you're so embarrassed by us  and you think we're losers,  well, then we don't want to hang out with you, either.  Good. Who needs you bums? I got Stryker.  Oh, yeah?  Well, I hope you two are happy together, you jerk.  BOY: Cool wheelchair, dick.  JOE: Thanks. Did you see the backpack hanging off it?  Wow, you know,  I never thought I could be talked into wingsuiting.  You're gonna love it.  It's just a short hike from here to the summit.  A hike? It's no problem.  Shouldn't affect my old football injury.  I spilled hot chili on my nuts.  You're a riot, Peter.  Hey, you sure you're up for this?  Oh, hell yeah. When I commit to something, I go all the way,  like when I had Kathleen Turner's voice.  (KATHLEEN TURNER'S VOICE): Good morning, guys.  Peter, what's wrong with your voice?  I got punched in the throat at the Clam last night.  Now I sound exactly like Kathleen Turner.  I'm just gonna get my stromboli.  Hey! Get away from my stromboli, Kathleen Turner!  (SHOUTS)      Wow, that's, uh that's some view.  I know, isn't it?  You see that rock formation over there?  We're gonna fly right through the center of it.  It's called threading the needle.  Totally intense.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah. Or-or how about this?  Maybe you jump off this cliff  and I spin around over there and sing Sound of Music.  Or-or we could just go home and watch Sound of Music.  I can see you're a little nervous, Peter,  but I'm telling you, it is easier than you think.  Watch.    Wow, look at him go.  You know, just when I thought  he couldn't get any cooler, he goes (BLEEP)  Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Oh! What-what just There's almost nothing left of him!  And I just know I'm gonna be the one  to have to intify the body.  (CRYING): That's him. Poor guy.  He looks like a bowl of tomato soup.  Guy next to him died in a fire  He looks like a grilled cheese sandwich.  Oh, these two poor souls are the best combination  for a rainy Saturday.  So, hey, guys.  What are we drinking? Beer?  Hey, Quagmire, how about one of your famous sexual stories?  Take a hike, Peter.  Ah, oh, you-you mean something Joe can't do?  (LAUGHS)  Friendly jokes indicating closeness.  We heard about Stryker dying.  Ah, craps.  Yeah, give it up.  We know the only reason you're here  is 'cause your cool friend is gone.  That's right. We're not your floppy seconds, Peter.  It's actually ""sloppy.""  Well, for me, it's both.  But listen, you really hurt our feelings.  You can't just treat us like garbage and then expect us  to take you back like nothing happened.  Okay, that's-that's too bad 'cause that was kind of my plan.  Well, you can go to hell, Peter.  We're tired of you taking us for granted.  Yeah, and this isn't even the first time  you ditched us for someone else.  Remember when you blew us off  to hang out with Jerry Seinfeld?  Julia Louis-Dreyfus has a lot of Emmys now.  Yeah.  Why did your wife steal that cookbook?  Peter, I'm sorry about your friend Stryker.  I know it's got to be hard to watch a man explode  like a bug on a windshield.  No, it's not that  I mean, I do see that every time I close my eyes  But it's the guys.  They're really mad at me, and I'm-I'm afraid  they don't want to be friends with me anymore.  Well, it's hard to blame them.  You treated them like you don't even care about them.  I do care about them.  It's just, when I hung around with Stryker,  people thought I was cool, and it-it felt good.  No one ever thinks I'm cool.  Your friends thought you were cool, until you dumped them.  Oh, wow, I guess you're right.  I treated them like crap.  I just got to find a way to make it up to them.  You got any ideas?  Mom? Dad? Can Gary Glitter, Jeffrey Jones  and Jared from Subway spend the night?  I don't know, Peter,  but it's got to be something really meaningful,  because imagine how they feel.  After all, you were willing to jump off a cliff for Stryker.  Well, they didn't say yes, but they didn't say no.  You're right.  Thanks, Lois.  And now I know exactly what I have to do.  Uh, where the hell are you going?  Lois told me to go jump off a cliff  to prove my friendship to the guys.  Are-are you, are you sure that's what she said?  I-I don't know, Brian. Her shirt was kind of open.  I was trying to get a peek down there.  Anyway, I got to go jump off a cliff.  Peter, wait. H-Hold on. This is crazy!  Damn it.  Where's Peter going?  Huh?  Oh, for God's sake.  Hey, Quagmire, Cleveland and Joe.  It's your buddy, Peter, and I'm about to thread the needle  to prove to you guys how sorry I am  and that I'd do anything to win you back.  And if something goes wrong and I don't survive,  you can go ahead and delete  the Kennedy Center Honors from my DVR.  I'm-I'm never gonna watch that.  Okay, here goes nothing.  I just wish the sponsor on msuit was a little cooler.    CLEVELAND: Peter, stop!  Don't jump!  Brian told us you were gonna  Why are you wearing a douche suit?  They also make wipes!  They're not known for their wipes.  Peter, you don't have to jump off a cliff  to prove you're sorry.  Not all of us believe that, but we took a vote  and I agreed I'd respect the majority.  Look, you really treated us badly,  but the fact that you'd be willing  to literally risk your life just to show us how much you care,  well, that says a lot.  Listen, I'm so sorry.  If being cool means don't get to hang out with you guys,  then I don't ever want to be cool.  What do you say? Can we just go back to being friends?  - Of course. - You bet.  Totes McGoats.  (LAUGHS) ""Totes McGoats""?  Maybe you guys are cool. Fist bump.  Ah, crap! (SCREAMS)  - Oh, my God! - Peter!  Should I shoot him, make it go quicker?  I got a shot.  Too late. You didn't answer quick enough.  (SCREAMING)  PETER: Hey, I'm doing it.  This ain't so hard.  Guys, I'm gonna do it!  I'm gonna thread the needle!  QUAGMIRE: What? We can't hear you!  We're very far away!  Oh, my God, I did it!  I was actually able to thread the  Oh, crap, Canadian goose.  Look out, eh?  (SCREAMING)  (BIRDS SQUAWKING)  Oh! Damn it! Ah! Son of a bitch!  (SCREAMING)  (GRUNTING)  (GROANS)  I think I'm okay.  Ah, nickels!  Well, it's good to be back, you guys.  A-And I'm sorry again I dumped you for Stryker.  Who the hell is this Stryker guy you keep talking about?  What do you mean?  He's that cool, handsome guy I was friends with.  He's the whole reason I went wingsuiting and hurt my head.  Wingsuiting?  Peter, you hurt your head in a ladies' bathroom.  Yeah, your legs fell asleep and you bashed it against a sink.  You were in a coma for two weeks.  You must've dreamed about this Stryker or something.  No, we were buddies.  We rode on his motorcycle.  And he introduced me to 1997 George Clooney.  Okay, well, right there you should've known it wasn't real.  Huh.  Well, whether it was real or not,  I want you to know you are the best friends I've ever had.  Of course we know that, Peter.  Yeah, and we feel the same way.  Hey, this is a really weird question,  but do you boys want to go out dancing?  PETER: That night,  we danced until the sun came up.  We forgot all about my coma  and my crazy dream about a cool guy.  We were just four middle-aged men  doing Ecstasy at a Mexican prom.  I'm Peter Griffin, and these are my stories."

A show with just one character  and an unlimited number of other characters?  Peter, you can't just sit there and watch TV all day.  - You have to mow the lawn. - Aw, this sucks.  I was gonna go down to the Guitar Center  and annoy people.  FYI: My mom's not picking me up for a long time, because  she's dead!  Hey, Brian, you want a beer?  Peter, Lois is gonna be home soon.  Shouldn't you be mowing the lawn?  I am mowing the lawn.  (BLEATING)  - Where'd you get these? - Craigslist.  Boy, that's got to be some long list.  WOMAN: and pool tables and jukeboxes  Craig, are you getting all this down?  Yes. Is that it?  No! Futons, everyone's grandfather's golf clubs  I-Is that it?  No! Gay sex  - What kind? - All of it!  I have milked all the goats.  Peter, all those goats are males.  Well, the buckets are full and the goats are happy.  I just hope word doesn't get around.  I like good times.  ANNOUNCER: We now return to Top Gun  with only public domain music.  (BAND PLAYS LIVELY INTRO)  She'll be coming 'round the mountain when she comes   She'll be coming 'round the mountain   Oh, my God, what the hell did the goats do in here?  This place is disgusting!  Where's your father?  Peter!  PETER (BLEATS): Lois is maaaad.  Go to the Claaaam.  Peter, I both saw you and recognized my husband's voice.  Go baaaack.  Lois! I-I didn't know you were home.  Well, I guess we can all agree this was a great idea. The end.  Ba-na-na-na Family Guy   Enough! My parents will be here any minute.  You better get this house cleaned up.  Don't worry, Lois. I have a Roomba.  (WHIRRING)  Okay, wait, wait, wait a minute.  It'll it'll figure it out.  It's learning. That's-that's part of what it does.  I think it's getting it.  Now she's cookin'.  Hang on to your hat.  Clean floor dead ahead.  Good purchase.  Behold the future.  All right, here it goes.  (WHIRRING STOPS)  And the battery's dead.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Darling, so wonderful to be here.  (CHUCKLES): Yeah, right. The drive here is like  a counterclockwise trip around the Monopoly board.  PETER (CHUCKLES): He has no paaaants.  Peter, get out of there.  Lois, what's going on here?  Well, I asked Peter to mow the lawn.  Will somebody turn off Top Gun?!  (SONG STOPS)  So obviously he bought a herd of goats,  and now they've taken over the house.  Lois, I worry this is not a healthy environment  - for the children. - Mom, please.  You know I would never put my children in harm's way.  Oh, boy. AMBER Alert.  Stewie was last seen with a goat in a '98 Toyota Tercel  heading north on I-95.  How do you turn those off, by the way?  Lois, I've seen enough.  You're completely overwhelmed, and you have four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  (CHUCKLES) Four children.  Hey!  You need help, Lois.  And since I don't believe in psychiatry,  I'm getting you a nanny.  Well, I guess it would be good to have some help  with Meg and Chris.  And Stewie, if he's ever found.  Honey, do you think that's the goat and baby  - from the AMBER alert? - Uh, it's a Tercel,  but I don't think it's the right year.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  That must be the new nanny.  Is this the Griffin house?  Welcome to this work environment.  Oh. I'm not the nanny. I'm her Uber driver.  Your nanny's still in the car.  She dozed off on the way here.  I not doze off, Yoober.  Was looking at crinkled photos of dead relatives.  Hello. I am Natalia.  What is favorite breakfast fish?  Well, if you must know  Welcome to this work environment.  Okay, Natalia, level with me.  Why are you really here?  I have been sent to neutralize liberal Jewish dissident,  Fievel Mousekewitz.  Oh. Well, the only mouse in this neighborhood is  our innocent neighbor, Frank Maxwell.  Comrade Mousekewitz!  Did you think you could run forever?  I, uh, I think you've got the wrong mouse.  I'm just regular old Frank Maxwell,  and I'm very late for work.  Good day, ma'am.  (STARTS ENGINE)  Whoa! You killed him?  That was not me.  Someone else got to him first.  Tough break, Jew mouse. Ha-ha!  Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.  Under parody law, in order to use someone else's character  in an unlicensed fashion, we have to provide  something called ""commentary.""  The commentary here is that Mickey Mouse hates Jews.  Now, let's see what else this new nanny has up her sleeve.  Okay, Stewie, this is favorite Belarusian children book  called Goodnight Moon of Chernobyl.  ""Goodnight Chernobyl moon.  Goodnight radiation house.  Goodnight melted phone.  Goodnight glowing milk.  Goodnight bleeding grandpa's eyes.  Goodnight two-headed cat.  Goodnight nobody.  Goodnight blocks and blocks and blocks of nobody.  The end.""  Next book.  Everybody Poops  Blood.  I'll get started on dinner.  No need to start dinner.  Homework is done. Kids are fed.  You two should go out and have lovely evening.  - Together? - Yes. Everything taken care of.  Go out. Enjoy American freedom.  What do you say, Peter?  Eh, it could be fun. And we haven't been on a date  since I broke the Guinness record  for longest nasal exhale at that Tina Fey movie.  FEY: You're the baby mama? Well, that's no bueno.  (INHALES THROUGH NOSE)  (EXHALING THROUGH NOSE)  (CONTINUES EXHALING THROUGH NOSE)  Hello. I'm Steve.  I'll be your server this evening.  May I start you off with a cocktail?  (CLEARS THROAT)  You don't work here, do you?  I do not.  Oh, this is nice.  So, how's work?  Good.  How, uh  how's the stuff you do during your day?  - Good. - Good.  So is that it?  Did we do a date? Phones back on?  Peter, we finally have a chance to reconnect.  We've been given this opportunity.  It's like before we had kids.  We got to make the most of it.  H-Hang on, hang on, Lois.  Give me two of those round balls of butter and a breadstick.  You'll see where I'm heading with this.  Okay, look, look, look. Here's what you want.  - Here's what you got. - (CHUCKLES)  I'm very happy with what I got.  Hmm. Well, maybe I can give you half a breadstick later.  As long as you don't mind a little marinara dipping sauce.  That's absolutely disgusting.  And I love it.  You know what? I like date night.  To Natalia, for making it possible.  Pretty sure that's Steve's pee.  Enjoying your wine?  Oh, what an amazing night.  I told you we could have a fun time, just the two of us.  Fun's not over yet.  (MOANING)  PETER: Come on, let's get in the trunk.  I filled it with water so we can do it hippo-style.  Weightlessly,  with my feet lightly scraping the bottom as we do it.  LOIS: Okay. It's kind of sexy, I guess.  PETER: And in the hippo tradition,  first we must eat a whole head of lettuce.  - Now, do you have the lettuce? - I-I didn't know we were doing this.  Did you bring the lettuce?  Oh, no, I forgot.  Ronald, I asked you to do one thing.  Honey, honey I brought the lettuce.  So thanks to Natalia,  we've been spending so much more time together.  Let me tell you, Joe, it's really been a rediscovery.  - Hmm. - Joe, ""we time""  - is just as important as ""me time."" - Okay.  We've actually been watching The Middle together.  It's so funny! Isn't it funny, Peter?  It is actually funny. At least three times an episode  we turn to each other and we say,  BOTH: ""That's just like us!""  - (LAUGHING) - (LAUGHS)  Why are you laughing?  - It sounded funny. - But you had to be there.  Well, I was able to imagine myself there,  which is why I chuckled.  Oh, and, Donna, have you seen this Black-ish?  - Why are you asking me that? - I don't know.  It seems like you might like it.  Oh, and, waiter, have you seen this Fresh Off the Boat?  - Why are you asking me that? - I don't know.  It seems like you might like it.  Oh, there's Mort. Mort!  Have you seen this The Goldbergs?  MORT: Yes! I like it 'cause I'm Jewish.  Boy, our friends all seem to be happily married.  - (BOTH LAUGH) - Yeah, right.  You know, Donna told me in the bathroom  she and Cleveland haven't had sex  in over three months.  I love that you share things  that were told to you in confidence.  - Oh, and the poor Swansons. - I know.  Joe's dead from the waist down,  and Bonnie's dead from the waist up.  They're perfect for each other.  - (BOTH LAUGHING) - I know, I know.  I got to say, Peter, I really feel like  Natalia has helped put the spark back  in our relationship.  Yeah, we even had independent movie sex.  I want to lean over this half-eaten blueberry pie  and kiss you with black coffee breath.  - Is that okay? - Yes.  Now, can I do you to a song you know,  but sung in German?  Icht valking un sonshine   Haaa-aah   Icht valking un sonshine   Haaa-aah   Unt it feelin das good.   (PHONE RINGING)  Hello? I see.  What is it?  I've been assassinated.  Wow, what a night.  I guess someone's sleep number is 69.  Uh, yes. It was, apparently, also number two.  Would you maybe make some coffee and give me a moment?  Car is packed for weekend.  - Weekend? - Yes.  You come in late last night drunk  and tell me to pack car for weekend getaway  you book online.  Then you make me watch Diff'rent Strokes episode  with substitute teacher played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  You know, I forgot about this weekend trip.  I-Is that something we still want to do?  Well, I do if you do.  Absolutely I do I-I was just seeing if you do.  Of course I do.  I mean, we've already had six nights out together.  It'd be great to have three more.  That's what I'm saying.  That-That's what any guy wants,  the same gal again and again and again  and again and again and again and again  and again and again and again and again  and again and again, and again.  And every gal wants the same guy who keeps  getting fatter and fatter and fatter and fatter  Stop it right there, Lois. This is Family Guy.  We only do the male side of the joke.  You know what? I think this weekend will be fun.  Yeah. I mean, it's not like we're gonna  miss anything around here.  Hey, Joe, what the hell's going on here?  Oh, you didn't hear? Today is the opening  of the first-ever Spooner Street Farmers Market.  (IN SLOW MOTION): Farmers  market?  Yeah, it's really exciting.  For 50 cents, you can get your picture taken  wearing a farmer's hat.  (IN SLOW MOTION): Farmer's  hat?  Hey, have a great weekend, you two.  So glad you're finding time for each other.  Goat meat.  Get your goat meat here.  - Cleveland, are those - Yep.  I have dibs on whatever silliness  Peter loses interest in.  Remember this?  To the Cleveland copter!  The moustache obscures my view!  (CRIES OUT)  LOIS: Oh, another hawk.  Or maybe it's the same one.  You think it could be the same one?  Doubt it.  Hey, do you have the address?  I think it's in my pocketbook somewhere.  'Cause I got to know if we should take 24 or 495.  Hang on.  - Anything? - Hang on.  Exit's coming up.  Half a mile.  - Quarter mile. - (LAUGHS)  You'd think I could find it.  (CHUCKLES): Yeah, yeah, I would.  I would. Okay, I'm taking 495.  Okay, uh, here, let me see if it's  Oh, this is why I don't like big purses.  Here it is. It says take 24 to 128.  (INHALES DEEPLY)  (EXHALES SLOWLY)  (WINDSHIELD SQUEAKING)  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  Hey, look, cookies.  - Chocolate chip? - Oatmeal raisin.  (BLEEP)  Ah, I guess they stopped serving dinner at 9:30.  Looks like that missed exit had the last laugh.  Oh, look at this cute note.  ""In lieu of television,  please tune in to each other.""  - Ha-ha. - Ha-ha, indeed. And get this.  ""Sorry no Wi-Fi, but the good news is  your marriage has four bars.""  - Terrific. - Oh, here's another note.  ""How adorable were those first two notes?  I hope you read this one third.""  There's a used condom in the fireplace.  And the fireplace is decorative,  so that's here to stay.  So, do you think word just got out  in the daddy longlegs community, like,  ""Hey, come to this hotel""?  Peter, it's a little warm in here.  Do you want to turn on that overhead ceiling fan?  Sure. Looks stable.  - Can you notice that? - Yeah.  Can you notice anything in the world other than that?  Only that fist-sized moth in the lampshade by the bed.  I'm going to bed so that ""go home time"" comes faster.  I'll just sleep with the light on.  Natalia, will you be our nanny forever?  Dah, unless Belarus security force  - track me down. - I'm sorry, what?  Natalia make a few enemies  before she leave Belarus.  (GUNSHOTS)  Natalia save baby.  - Brian? - Lock door.  Why would I (CRIES OUT)  Brian!  No kissing. Under bed.  - (BONE CRACKS) - (CRIES OUT)  - (BONES SNAPPING) - Aah!    Out.  Boy, that was a close one.  Ah, my son was in the backseat.  (TIRES SCREECHING)  (ENGINE REVVING)  (HEARTBEAT POUNDING)  (TIRES SCREECH)  Daddy?  (GUNFIRE)  Where are we going?  You're going home.  Count to three and pull cord.  (SHOUTING)  I don't know my numbers!  Again! Again!  (SALIVA SMACKING)  - Oh. This. - What?  That mealy-mouth thing you do.  Take a sip of water.  I don't like water. I like pop.  Hey, will you let me know when you're done  using the phone charger that I brought?  Oh, you mean the only thing that you packed?  Yeah, I just assumed if you pay,  - you don't have to pack. - Here we go.  My husband, the Rockefeller,  letting my parents pay for the nanny.  Kids still lining up around the block  for those piano lessons?  I wonder which has more clutter on it,  the piano or your treadmill.  You know what? I'm gonna go with the treadmill.  Really? Let's go knock on the door of the next room  and ask them which one of us is fat.  Oh, I'm so sorry I'm not Bradley Hooper.  It's Cooper, not Hooper.  You're thinking of Mr. Hooper from Sesame Street,  and I'd sooner bang him.  He was a business owner. He was a successful man.  You think you're the only one in this relationship  who wants to be with a successful man?  Get over yourself.  Oh, hey, do you want these spit droplets back,  Or are they for my arm to keep?  Sorry, I was trying to scare that fly on your hand.  Oh, it's a liver spot. Never mind.  I'm hoping it's cancer. I want the ticket out.  Oh, if you die, can I have all of your nothing?  What do you mean if I die?  I've been dead since the minute I said ""I do""!  Well, the minute you say ""I don't,""  I am out that door.  - Oh, is that right? - Yep.  Well, what if I just said, ""The hell with it, go""?  What if you did?  Go.  Fine!  (""SO FAR AWAY"" BY CAROLE KING PLAYING)    So far away   Doesn't anybody stay   In one place anymore?   It would be so fine   To see your face at my door   It doesn't help to know   You're just time away   Long ago I reached for you   And there you stood   Holding you again could only   Do me good   How I wish I could   But you're so   Far   Away.   So, how was the trip?  (BOTH LAUGHING)   PETER: Just terrible."

You there, mailman.  Me?  No, the other black guy in shorts. Yes, you.  - Here. - Well.  You, sir, are a racist and a rude one at that.  So, you're not a mailman?  Okay, yes, I am a mailman,  but these are my 1983 Maurice Cheeks shorts.  So, you're gonna deliver this card or what?  Mm, fine, I will.  I took an oath.  If mail touches me, I have to deliver it.  (BELLS CHIMING)  Sorry, it's my chimes.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Hey, Cleveland, come on in.  Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!  What the hell's he doing?!  Sorry, Cleveland, he wanted a surprise party  and this is how he thinks it works.  Surprise! Surprise!  Here you go, Chris.  I also have a fat, weird boy.  Would you like a hug?  Yes. Birthdays are the hardest.  Grandpa only gave me a dollar?  Chris, you write him a thank-you note.  That will is still wide open.  Wow, a dollar.  29 more cents and I can buy ""My Sharona"" on iTunes.  Boy, that guy did not like sharing Sharonas.  Nobody will know 'cause it's in a coffee cup.   Wow, getting drunk in the morning.  Who are you, Hoda Kot-ba  Hoda Ka-Ka-ba H-Kot  Kathie Lee Gifford?  Ah, come on, it's just an eye-opener.  Just a little hair of the me.  Spoken like a truly unfunny alcoholic.  You know, I bet you couldn't go a single day without booze.  (SCOFFS) One day? You're on.  How much you want to bet?  I will bet you one dollar.

Yeah   - Nailed it. - (MUSIC STOPS)  Okay, time for second breakfast.  CLERK: Welcome to McBurgertown.  What can I get for you today?  Hmm, what's the easiest thing to eat in the car?  Um, I'll have the huevos rancheros  and an orange soda without a cap.  That'll be $3.74.  Awesome. I can pay in change.  (TIRES SCREECH)  Mmm.  I should visit the Southwest.  I know I'd love it.  Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?  - Fleek yeah! - Not really.  Well, there's this game where  you try to toss a penny into a shot glass.  And if you miss, you got to drink?  No, you just drink the whole time.  - Aw, sweet! - Fleekin' ""A""!  No more, Joe!  Yeah, that sounds awesome.  Hey, anybody got a hundred pennies for a dollar?  TOM: I do.  ""American Red Cross""?

All right, now, I see you've got large breasts.  In recognition of that, I'd like to tip you one dollar.  You know, even though you and Peter have your differences,  I'm glad it hasn't affected our friendship.  Us redheads have to stay together, right?  (BOTH LAUGH)  So this is ""stuck at work""?  Honey, please. Lois is a friend.  Really, Nicole, you got the wrong idea.  How does this bitch know my name?  Bitch?  Okay, ho.  Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.  Come on, now, ladies.

No Whammies, no Whammies, no Whammies,  Big Bucks, Big Bucks, and stop!  (FOGHORN BLOWS)  (WHAMMY LAUGHS)  Ah, rats.  Well, perhaps I press my luck with Meg.  Hey there, Meg.  I was wondering if you'd let me take you out  for a feast of Indian food, followed by  some blow-off-to-the-side curry burps?  Oh, I-I can't tonight.  I, um, I have a date with a Whammy.  (WHAMMY LAUGHS)  All right, well, if you're ever free,  here's me number.  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Oh, hi, Chris.  But well, that's that's my line.  Hey, I came by to bring you a frame  for that birthday dollar I gave you.  Hi, Meg.  What a disrespectful turd.  You brought a frame?  Why would I frame a dollar?  Chris, didn't you take a look at that dollar?  It's an extremely rare misprint.  Benjamin Franklin and Washington are both on the front,  posing back-to-back like an '80s sitcom.  Sorry, Grandpa, I lost that dollar.  You what?!  We got to find that thing!  I get the last joke before the commercial?  (GASPS) Wow, this is a first.  Okay, okay a priest, a rabbi  and a Frenchman walk into a bar  NARRATOR: Family Guy will return after these messages.  - Last line! - NARRATOR: No, it isn't.  All right, Chris, if we're going to find that misprint dollar,  we have to retrace your steps.  Now, where'd you go after your birthday party?  Well, first I drank a Four Loko,  and then I rode my bike down to the hair salon  and shouted ""Nope!"" at all the women who came out.  Huh. Call me next time you do that.  Hi, Meg.  Unbelievable.  Can I have a can of chaw and a fork?  Do you need this phone number on here?  Nah.  How long has that bike been out front?  I don't know, a couple hours.  I'm gonna swipe that puppy.  All right, got some vodka and tampons.  Now to go ask Chris how they're doing this at the high school.  - Aha! - Stewie?  Wh-What are you doing here?  Busting you. You were gonna drink that.  Technically, no.  Do you even hear yourself?  Look, I'm gonna fix this.  I know a guy who's got pills that help stop addictions.  Ugh, fine.  All right, we are buying none of these.  Please put them back. But we'll take one of these.  Ooh, Charleston Chew. Good choice.  You know about putting them in the freezer?  Yeah. I know about the freezer.  There's nothing you can teach me, thank you.  All right, this is where we can buy those pills  to get you off the sauce.  MAN: You guys ready for this?  Stewie, who is this guy?  My friend, Todd. He's gonna help us out.  But this looks like a drug den.  What are you talking about?  DOORBELL:  Drug den, drug den   Drug den, drug den.   I told you it was a drug den.  How you doing? Come on in.  (""SISTER CHRISTIAN"" BY NIGHT RANGER PLAYING)  Where you goin'?   What you lookin' for?   Hello, new friends.  Welcome to my ""prescription pad.""  (CHUCKLES) Get it?  W-We're dead. We're getting shot.  Oh, calm down.  Heads up. Sometimes my knob plays peek-a-boo  - through my pee hatch. - (FIRECRACKER EXPLODES)  So, I hear you guys need some benzos.  Yeah, we got to dry this dog up.  - (FIREWORK EXPLODES) - W-Wait, hang on, hang on, hang on.  This is my favorite part of the song.  (DRUMS BUILDING)  - Tequila! -  Motoring.   Ah, I'm thinking of a different song.  So, uh, you guys got the $500?  Here's a little taste.  And there's more where that came from.  But I got to see the merchandise first.  Good, good, I need singles.  I got to do laundry so I can stop hanging out  in my underwear with a bunch of guys.  All right, give me all your money!  Stewie, what's this guy doing?  No idea. I don't know him that well.  He was kicking a Redbox machine outside of CVS.  Seemed like the kind of guy who could help us out.  (GUNSHOT)  (BOTH SCREAM)  (SHOTGUN COCKS)  (BOTH SCREAM)  (YELLS)  (GUNSHOT, SHOTGUN COCKS)  (SQUEAKING)  Damn it.  Pistorius!  Boom! Through the bathroom door.  Did you just name-drop ""Pistorius""?  He's still a hero to us.  So I made it, Cleveland made it, and now you made it, Joe.  Yeah. Thanks for the recap.  Yeah. Everybody's made it but this guy.  Quit it! Get off of me.  Ah, what's wrong, Pete?  Boop. Boop. Boop-boop-boop.  Stop it! Stop touching me.  Hey, guys, I did it three more times  while you were grab-assing.  MAYOR WEST: Need a lift?    (RAT SQUEAKS)  (LAUGHS)  We could be a Geico commercial.  You're absolutely right.  You don't have ass or grass, so I'll be taking this dollar.  (RAT SQUEAKS)  No, no, no. I don't want ass.  Just give me the dollar.  And now to turn slightly.  (YELLS)  Ah, heck!  I did a fail.  (WIND WHISTLES)  Ah, a dollar.  Oh, my dollar.  I guess Meg didn't care.  (SIGHS) My heart broken,  and nothing to console me but the screaming black dolphins.  Man, that dollar's getting all over town.  (LAUGHS) Yeah, like your mama.  (LAUGHS) Ah, dag!  Aw, man, you know I'm just playin'.  Hey, man, you seen that movie The Cove?  The Cove?  How yous gonna be talkin' about The Cove?  I mean, I saw the movie, but I was like, ""Oh, (BLEEP).""  Ah, man, you know, what even is a cove?  I think it's like what a white dolphin calls a bay.  They be all like, ""Honey,  I'm taking Cooper and Tucker down to the cove.""  - Right, right. - Rest of us be like,  -  Sittin' in the mornin' sun.  - Don't do it, then,  - don't do it! - Oh, I'm-a do it!  All right, t-then just squeak out the whistle part.  (SQUEAKS TO THE TUNE OF ""SITTIN' ON THE DOCK OF THE BAY"")  - (BEATBOXING) - (CONTINUES SQUEAKING)  You ever had your heart broken, Jerome?  Hell yeah, man.  Married my high school sweetheart.  Week after our wedding, she was diagnosed with cancer.  At her funeral, our little girl caught pneumonia.  We buried her next to her mom six weeks later.  You never seen a casket so small.  I hear you.  I gave me number to a girl and she threw it away.  You and me, fraternity of pain, eh?  Okay, this is the one.  Son of a  (LIGHTSABER HUMMING)  - Come on, Peter. Let's call it. - No, Joe!  Nobody's leaving until I sink a penny in that glass!  - Oh, for God's sakes. - No  Say, Peter, you know, maybe you should  try this one with your eyes closed.  Just feel it.  But if I close my eyes,  you'll all disappear and I'm a-scared of being alone.  Don't worry, Peter.  (INHALES DEEPLY)  Guys?  We're right here, Peter. Throw it.  (GASPS) Oh, my God, I made it?  - Sure. - Right in.  Amazing.  Yes! I've never felt so much power.  I'm gonna go have sweaty day-sex with my wife.  Excuse me, sir,  would you like to buy some candy to send Jewish kids  to a Jewish place to do Jewish things?  Will it get you out of my bar?  It sure will.  (BIRDS CHIRPING)  Look who's still standing, bitch.  Go buy yourself something nice in hell.  Hey there, sailor.  What are you doing here?  Oh, sometimes I come here to think and fart.  So, you still up for our date?  Our date? But I thought you got rid  of the dollar with my number on it.  No, I put your number in my phone, silly.  So, what do you say? Are you free tonight?  Let me consult me charts and maps.  Low tide (MUTTERS) 5:23.  Oh, yeah. Moonrise, 7:48.  (MUTTERING)  Aye, looks like I am.  (WIND WHISTLING)  (TIRES SCREECH)  Lois, I tossed a penny in a shot glass,  so get your pants off and put a towel on the kitchen table!  LOIS: Peter, I'm in the middle of book club.  - Forget book club, we're doin' it. - (DISHES CLATTERING)  Anyone who doesn't want to see my big, white, flailing butt,  get the hell out.  Joe, I found a dollar!  JOE: That's great, Bonnie!  Let's go to dinner. We can talk all about it.  What's there to talk about?  I looked down on the ground and there was a dollar.  Bonnie, save it for the dinner table!  Crap, I don't have any change.  Hey, Seamus, you got change for a dollar?  I don't know. Is my boat parked illegally in the harbor?  I don't know.  Are you gonna make a contribution  to the Policeman's Ball?  I don't know. Are you gonna help me move next week?  Geez, what are you two, dating or something?  SEAMUS AND JOE: I don't know.  (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)  Good evening, everyone. Welcome to Whispers.  I'm your hostess, Ida, and as always,  I am joined by my trusty psychic, Ryan Reynolds.  - I knew you'd say that. - (LAUGHS)  Piano? Comedy? What don't you do?  - Windows. - (LAUGHS)  Trust me, folks, he doesn't, I've tried.  God, this is going well.  Well, Stewie, you were right. I couldn't make it a day without drinking.  Well, the important thing is  you barely tried and then got shot.  So I read a fun compatibility quiz in Cosmo.  I don't know if you want to take it.  - I don't. - I didn't either!  Compatible!  If you'll excuse me, I have to urinate  every time something good happens.  (LIGHT APPLAUSE)  I thought the show was really great.  Thank you. I couldn't help but notice you talked throughout it.  (CROWD WHOOPING, DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)  Take it off!  I want to see if mine look right.  Well, Chris, we've looked all over town.  Might as well check here.  This is where dollar bills come to die.  Wait, Grandpa, look!  I don't believe it!  Oh, no. Now we'll never find it.  Hold on. I got an idea.  Hey, can I turn off everything but the black lights?  - Sure, I don't care about anything. - Cool.  Wow, this place is gross!  Yeah, the NBA All-Star Game was in town last week.  There it is!  I got it, Grandpa!  Attaboy!  Happy Birthday, Grandson.  Thanks.  Hey, so, how much is this rare dollar worth, anyway?  Ah, well, some dildo wrote his phone number on it,  so now it's worth jack!    The best things in life are free   But you can give them to the birds and bees   I want money   Yes, ooh-ooh-ooh   That's what I want   Yes, ooh-ooh-ooh.   Ho ho!  Is everyone who was in the show!  H-Hold on, everyone. Everyone?  Ellen DeGeneres wants a selfie of all of us.  Come on, squeeze in, now.  We're gonna blow up the Internet.  Let's take all that we did today and make it all about Ellen.  MAN: Hey, I'm right here!  That caption's a phony!"

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Hi there. It's me, Peter.  You know, when it comes to making dreams come alive,  there used to be nothing like the movies.  So we thought it would be fun to ask  a few visionary Hollywood directors to create his  Let's be honest, his  Own unique version of the same Family Guy story,  ""Peter Gets Fired.""  Of the countless directors we contacted,  three did not say no immediately,  and I got a weird message from Paul Verhoeven  - that I could not understand. - (PHONE BEEPS)  VERHOEVEN: Ah, Pieoter, habinsky Vermhoeven.  Kibbensme comfurdle. Stupf.  I've listened to that over a hundred times now.  I-I got nothin'.  Anyway, here's our first director,  Quentin Tarantino.  (""VEHICLE"" BY THE IDES OF MARCH PLAYING)  Hey, well, I'm the friendly stranger   In the black sedan, won't you hop inside my car?   I got pictures, got candy, I'm a lovable man   And I can take you to the nearest star   I'm your vehicle, baby   I'll take you anywhere you wanna go   I'm your vehicle, woman   By now I'm sure you know   -  That I love ya  -  Love ya   -  I need ya  -  Need ya   I want you, got to have you, child   Great God in heaven, you know I love you   - What's in your lunch? - Pizza.  From home or from a place?  A place.  Well, if you wants to be a movie star   I'll get a ticket to Hollywood.   Griffin, you're three hours late.  Stop trying to be a clock, you ain't got the face for it.  I've had enough of your nonsense.  Here's Christoph Waltz to fire you in a weird accent.  Yer fi-yerd!  (DOOR CREAKS, PETER GASPS)  It's a clichÃ©.  You think you can fire me?  I'm taking this keg as payback.  (SURF ROCK PLAYING)  Cinema is an event.  (KNOCK AT DOOR)  (BREATHING UNSTEADILY)  - Where's my family? - ANGELA: Dead. All of them.  (GUNSHOT AUDIO SLOWED)  (GUNSHOT)  (MONITOR BEEPING)  (GASPS)  Oh, my God, where am I?  - What happened? - Ugh! Coma breath.  Coma?! How long was I out?  - What year is this? - It's whatever year  Quentin Tarantino used to watch television.  Well, can I go home?  Well, you're not really ready,  but if it's for revenge,  you can stab me with this scalpel  - and then run out. - Thanks.  Oh, that was unnecessary but cool.  So awesome!  Ah, so close.  No, this is better.  (""LITTLE GREEN BAG"" BY GEORGE BAKER SELECTION PLAYING)    Yeah.   Somebody order a wet-haired black guy  to help with your revenge and sometimes  (LOUDLY): speak louder than necessary?    PETER: Angela?  We got business.  (IRONSIDE THEME PLAYING)  Sorry, that's my car alarm. Cleveland, turn that off!  CLEVELAND: I'm pressing the button.  Y-You got to put the keys in the ignition.  I've been doing that, but  - (ALARM CHIRPS) - Oh, there we go.  Tricia Takanawa 88s!    Peter, I'm standing here because I am  the only Asian recurring character on the series.  (PAINED GRUNTING)  (BLADES CLANKING)  (PAINED GRUNTS)  (SLOWED WHOOSHING)  (JAMES BROWN'S ""SEX MACHINE"" PLAYING)  -  Get on up  -  Get on up   -  Get up  -  Get on up   -  Get up  -  Get on up   -  Get on up  -  Get on up   -  Stay on the scene  -  Get on up   Like a lovin' machine   Get on up   -  Get up  -  Get on up   -  Taste  -  Get on up   -  Of piano  -  Get on up.   Peter, you can tell I'm different  because my weapon is different.  Oh, well, then, maybe I won't be able  to chop your head off.  Oh, yep.  (BLADES RING)  (MAN SINGING OPERA IN ITALIAN)    Opera music makes violence classy.  (GASPS)  Of course.  That!  What's new, pussycat?   Whoa, whoa, whoa   What's new, pussycat? Whoa.   Welcome back to our special episode,  featuring famous directors' versions  of the same Family Guy story, ""Peter Gets Fired.""  I'm still here in front of the Hollywood Sign,  but I've asked the cameraman to adjust the shot  so that you can only see ""wood.""  I thought that would be hilarious.  You know why? 'Cause of boners.  Anyway, our next director is Wes Anderson,  a guy who makes you feel like you ate a pot brownie  and woke up in a greeting card.  Mmm.  Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum.  STEWIE: On a March day, with a temperature of 64 degrees,  my father lost his position  with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company,  near our village in central Quahogia.  Needless to say, it would change our lives forever.  What does it say? I can't read spaghetti.  You're relieved of your position.  I see. And what's to happen to my play?  The opening is only days away.  The play's off.  STEWIE: With no discernible reaction,  my father made his way home to deliver the news to my mother.  Let me tell you about my house.  We lived in a New England cottage  that was inside a vintage Army tent,  that was inside a decommissioned submarine,  that was all inside an old airplane hangar.  I've lost my position  with the Pawtucket Brothers Brewery Company.  And the play is off.  (GASPS)  We have to inform the children.  STEWIE: My brother Chris had spent his life  conjoining his twin loves,  medicine and escape artistry.  Eureka.  A possible cure.  (BUZZES)  Do you want to do a Spider-Man kiss?  STEWIE: Our dog Brian had been making a name for himself  on the pickleball court.  ANNOUNCER: And that's match for Gene Porterfield.  Are those marking sole shoes?  I'd like to officially file a grievance.  STEWIE: Brian had quietly become the most successful  grievance filer in league history.  I'll be there right away.  STEWIE: The exterior of our house is a lighthouse now.  Inside's the same.  Okay, back to the story.  I've summoned you all and arranged you  in a perfectly symmetrical form in front of me  to tell you some important news.  I've been relieved of my position at the brewery.  What of the play?  The play is postponed, indefinitely.  No, Mr. Griffin.  You need to do this play.  We'll help you.  But I've lost access to the brewery.  That's where the whole piece is set.  Maybe it doesn't have to be.  But that's where the free tape and paper is.  I'll buy you new tape and paper.  The play is back on.  STEWIE: On an overcast Thursday afternoon,  my father presented his play,  one of the most compelling stories of the 1980s,  Max Dugan Returns.  Max, you've returned!  I have.  (CHEERING)  This took a lot of work.  (GERMAN VERSION OF ""I GOT YOU BABE"" PLAYING)  STEWIE: My father passed away in the spring of his 43rd year,  and was put to rest in the family graveyard.  He died chasing a PokÃ©mon across a busy street.    Hey there. It's me again.  Wouldn't it be great if Wes Anderson's movies  were actually that short?  Anyway, the Hollywood Sign is more historic than you think.  On this very spot, 52 years ago,  a piece of beef jerky was planted in the ground  and watered with Red Bull.  A speedboat erupted from the soil,  and in that speedboat was Michael Bay.  (EXPLOSION, SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)    This already doesn't make sense.    You're fired, Griffin,  for destroying company property.  Tell it to my tongue.  (BOTH BABBLING)  Mr. President, we have a situation.  The Decepticons plan to destroy the Seven Wonders of the World,  starting with the Hagia Sophia.  The what? Is that even one of the Seven Wonders?  CARTER: The Decepticons have only one weakness.  They're allergic to beer.  I don't like the taste either so much.  CARTER: That chest plate is where they're most vulnerable.  If we could find someone strong enough to throw a keg  with enough force, we might have a shot.  (8-BIT BEEPING, EXPLOSION)  The only problem is, there's not a man alive  who can throw a keg with that kind of force.  There may be one.  BRUCE: I wonder who it is.    Our top story, stopping the Decepticons with beer?  According to our sources,  the search is underway for a man strong enough  to throw a keg with enough force  to save the Seven Wonders of the World.  (KNOCK AT DOOR)  What took you so long?  There was a train and I like to count the cars.  It was a big one.  Me, too. That is fun.  But you're wasting your time coming here.  I don't throw kegs anymore.  (SULTRY MUSIC PLAYS)  Who's this?  What are you wearing? That's my funeral shirt.  Look, Peter, I didn't want to ask you to do this  because of that maverick but awesome thing you did  in the battle war of the past.  Is this the stuff you didn't want me to ask you about?  I told you not to ask me about that.  He went rogue and saved everyone's lives,  but he didn't do it by the book.  Is that why he can't get an erection?  Everyone stop talking about me!  Listen, it's not me that's asking,  it's America.  (FIREWORKS WHISTLE)  Tell America my answer is ""no.""  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go change my mind  in the shower.  POWER BALLAD SINGER: Peter's country needs him   But he just doesn't know   He's scared he'll miss his shows   And he's expecting a UPS package   Who's gonna water his plants?   He's got a lot of balls in the air   That's for sure.   (ENGINE REVS)  PETER: Hold on!  Damn it, I'm in.  But I do things my way, and I pick my crew.  Deal. Now let me sit sideways on your motorcycle  like a Vietnamese woman, and let's get out of here.  (ENGINE REVS)  (TIRES SCREECH)  Still trying to put the world back together, I see.  Hello, Peter.  We're not joining your team.  I'm putting together a team.  - We're in. - Good.  Let's shake hands like tough guys.  Some of your sweat went in my mouth.  (ENGINE REVS, TIRES SCREECH)  (SCOFFS)  Oh, hello, Peter.  I was just out back working in the garden.  Oh, yeah?  Trying to grow some balls?  Okay, okay.  LOIS: Play nice, boys.  (SULTRY HARMONICA TUNE PLAYS)  Love the cookie-cutter house you and Poindexter got here.  Never pegged you for a burbs dweller.  Peter, you used to live here.  That was a long time ago.  It was two months ago.  Two months is a long time  when you don't sleep and only eat ground beef.  Did you tell Chris about my mission?  I thought you should.  CHRIS: This is my favorite  out of all the Seven Wonders of the World.  The Hagia Sophia.  It's like God made a basilica for himself.  Dad, nothing bad will ever happen  to the Hagia Sophia, right?  Not on my watch.  TOM TUCKER: The Decepticons' second target  has been announced.  It's Machu Picchu.  (MOANS SOFTLY)  City in the clouds.  Inca Empire.  When did our kids get so obsessed with the Seven Wonders?  They learned it from you.  Got to go, babe.  Pete.  Save that (BLEEP) basilica.  (WOMAN VOCALIZING)  (CLUCKING)  According to the calculations on my Microsoft Surface,  they have advanced cloaking technology.  The Microsoft Surface confirms it.  Microsoft Surface.  My Samsung Gear S2 watch says the same thing.  We came from outer space to step on church stuff.  That does it.  Let's have a fight with so many quick shots and close-ups,  you can't tell what's going on.  Up   To break it back down   We're building it up   To burn it down   We can't wait   To burn it to the ground   (SCREECHES)  - (CRIES) - (GRUNTS)  The colors conflict.   (SCREECHES)  Peter, don't.  It's suicide.  Take care of my kids' bikes.  They're expensive.    Oh, my God!  I can't believe Peter's gone.  I never got to repeat to him the line he said to me  earlier in the film that has taken on new meaning  in the context of all that has happened.  (BAGPIPES PLAYING)  Today is the day we honor the late Peter Griffin,  the hero who saved the Seven Wonders of the World.  PETER: Who's that ugly son of a bitch?  Peter, you're alive.  But-but how?  You were blown into a million pieces.  Luckily, I know a couple of pretty good welders.  Wait, they-they welded you back together?  A-And they knew you were alive the whole time?  You want to ask questions or you want to do it in a cemetery?  (BOTH LAUGHING)  LOIS: Is is everything all right?  PETER: Yeah, no, I-I think I'm just tired  from all the flying back and forth.  Maybe we just talk here for a little bit,  and then you can tell everyone that I functioned as I should.  LOIS: Yeah, uh, okay.  PETER: So, which director thing was your favorite?  Mine was this one.  LOIS: Oh, honestly, I-I didn't care for the episode."

Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Thanks for driving me to the library for story time, Brian.  Today we're reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar  vs. The Human Centipede.  I heard it's like Alien vs. Predator.  With a little bit more butt eating.  That does sound fun, but what if I took you  - to a different library today? - What?  But I like my library. I met Curious George there.  Mom said he was a puppet, but she's stupid.  I'm just saying we should go to the library  at Quahog University  and take your education to a higher level.  I guess I can try it. I mean, I do want to get ahead.  I don't want to end up like Meg, doing sad one-woman shows.  Oh, I love trash   Anything dirty or dingy or dusty   Anything ragged or rotten or rusty   Yes, I love trash   (QUIETLY): Whose fault is this?  You're wearing a garbage bag as a cape.  Who do you think?  - Him? - Shh. She's crushing it!  Oh, yeah. That's good library.  Aw, you didn't come here for me; you came to be a creep.  Whatever. You go do your thing.  I'm gonna go watch that young hotshot attorney over there  who's clearly in the middle of a movie montage.  (UPBEAT SOUNDTRACK PLAYS)  STEWIE: Oh! He found it. He's gonna win the case.  (GUNSHOT)  STEWIE: Oh, no. It was a '70s movie.  (SOMBER SOUNDTRACK PLAYS)  - So, who you reading? - George Eliot.  Ah, Georgie.  I'm a big fan.  - I think he, uh - She.  She said it best when she said  ""Bantam Press, 1851.""  (GROANS SOFTLY)  - Lumineers? - What?  Hmm?  You just said ""Lumineers"" with no context.  (LIKE URKEL): Did I do that?  Ugh!  Tumblr?  Wow, I've never seen someone go oh for six in 15 minutes before.  Just hard rejection after hard rejection.  (INDISTINCT SHOUTS)  - What's going on over there? - Looks like a student rally.  They probably forgot to study for an exam,  so they organized a protest.  In the '90s, you'd just pull a fire alarm  Now you hold a protest.  That is, when they're not looking down at their phones.  Hey, what's going on?  Someone wrote ""weird"" on the transgender bathroom,  and the school president didn't overreact,  so we want him fired!  Seems reasonable.  Exactly!  Oh, I see news cameras.  I'm gonna yell ""Viva la Stool"" like a young, white drunkard.  And last week, a professor told his class to have a nice day,  which is microaggression,  because in our systemic rape culture  no day is a nice day.  So we want him fired, too.  (CHUCKLES): Hey, if you don't want to get fired,  - don't become a teacher, right? - Totally.  You should tweet that. #FireEveryone.  STEWIE: Viva la Stool!  Well, I guess I could fire up my account again.  All right, open app.  Got a bunch of those. No biggie.  Typing tweet.  Blast off in three,  two, one,  and tweeted.  I am back in the game. See?  Oop, you're gone.  And the crowd is gone.  And the animators are gone.  Hey, Stewie, what do you think about this tweet?  Oh, don't be that guy.  ""Kelly Ripa no-shows at work.""  Who does she think she is, a Republican senator?  (CHUCKLES) #G-O-P-U.  Three references in one tweet. I'm sweating.  I'll just add it to my notes for later.  Why are you getting into Twitter now?  Unless you're an athlete or a celebrity, no one cares.  A lot of people like my stuff.  Oh, yeah? Someone needs to tell Donald Trump  it's not fashionable  to wear orange on your face after Labor Day.  #OompaTrumpa.  Zero retweets. Zero likes.  - Yeah, viral. - You know, I don't care.  You can't stop me. Just like people  can't stop Peter from ordering shepherd's pie.  And what can I get for you, sir?  I'll have the shepherd's pie.  I'm sorry, but that's not on the menu.  - Well, do you have potatoes? - Yes.  - Butter? - Yes.  - Cream? - Yes.  - Salt? - Yes.  - Pepper? - Yes.  - Garlic? - Yes.  - Onions? - Yes.  - Lamb? - Yes.  - Carrots? - Yes.  - Eggs? - Yes.  - Flour? - Yes.  - Rosemary? - Yes.  - Thyme? - Yes.  - Chicken broth? - Yes.  - Corn? - Yes.  - Peas? - Yes.  Lightsaber?  Remember when we did Star Wars?  Better get a tweet out before I go dark for a few hours.  (CAMERA CLICKS)  About to see the new Kevin Hart movie.  Just kidding. I'm white and went to college.  #BaywatchMovie.  (LOW WHOOSHING GROWING LOUDER)  (DISTORTED, ECHOING THUMP)  (PHONE BEEPS)  (BAYWATCH THEME ""I'LL BE THERE"" PLAYING)  Some people stand in the darkness   Afraid to step into the light   Some people need to have somebody   When the edge of surrender's in sight   Don't you worry   It's gonna be all right   'Cause I'm always ready   I won't let you out of my sight.   (ELECTRONIC CHIRP)  Wow, I haven't seen that much camel toe  since the Arab Spring.  #ThinkingInTweets.  (IMITATES EXPLOSION)  (CHUCKLES): Nah.  Hey, are you @dogbackwards from Twitter?  I am. Are-are you a fan?  You racist jerk!  I hope you get foot-and-mouth disease!  What the hell was that?  - (ELECTRONIC CHIRPING) - Uh-oh.  STEWIE (LAUGHS): Wow, you are blowing up!  Blowing up bad.  Ah, look at that Huffington Post just picked it up.  Buckle up, buddy.  (BEEPS)  (EXCITED CHATTER)  - There he is! - MAN: Where? I'm in the back.    Hey, how was Baywatch? I want to see that bad.  What were you thinking, writing that tweet?  What? It was just a joke.  Brian, it's not 2005 You can't just go online  and say whatever you want.  Yeah, remember how mad people got when DiGiorno tweeted  about domestic violence?  And they're not even a guy. They're pizza.  All right, all right, I'll delete the tweet.  You haven't deleted it yet?  (LAUGHS): What a train wreck!  There. Done. Done.  See? It's done. It's gone.  What about all those people outside?  They'll see that I deleted it,  and it'll all blow over. Trust me.  I hope so, but you never know.  They're still pretty mad at me down at Dick's Sporting Goods.  Um, what's the name of this place?  Dick's.  A-And what's that say on your shirt?  - Dick's. - (SNICKERS)  Can I have two balls and a helmet?  Hey, you're the guy from the phone.  (LAUGHING)  Start the car, Chris!  - Did you get him, Dad? - We got him!  Hey, Sid. Happy Mango Monday.  Hmm.  Hmm. Those nighttime information technology classes  must really be getting to Sid.  Hey, Curt.  Hmm.  Curt? Come on, it's me,  Lunchtime Lois. (CHUCKLES)  Gil, help me out here.  Hmm!  Gil, no! Uh, what about Barbara? Is she back there?  She can clear this up.  Let me talk to Barbara.  She doesn't want to talk to you, either.  Nobody does  Not as long as you're living with that racist dog.  Oh, come on!  It was just a bad joke.  Where's Stanley?  He'll vouch for me. Let me talk to Stanley.  Or Henry. Somebody help me out here.  - Chip? - Hmm!  - Karen? - Hmm!  - JJ? - Hmm.  - Angela? - Hmm.  - Tito? - Hmm!  - Larry? - Hmm!  You can't freeze me out like this.  We're on a first-name basis!  They're on our name tags, Lois.  But I don't even have to look! (SHUDDERS)  (QUAVERING): I don't even have to look!  Hey, how come no one told me we were going to the Clam?  Hey, Jerome, give me a beer.  Oh, why? 'Cause I'm, like, your slave?  Man, you're no better than your racist dog.  Come on, man.  B-Brian was just making a joke.  I told you about Brian. I told you.  Come on, he deleted his tweet.  But the hurt has been RT'd in our hearts.  Peter, you better get out of here  before I start saying ""sir"" like a cop.  - Come on, Joe, I - Sir? Sir?  You've been asked to leave.  - Joe, it's me, Peter. I - Sir.  I don't want to have to ask you again.  - Please leave. - All right, fine.  - Sir! - No, Joe, Joe.  - He's leaving. - Sir!  - Joe, Joe - Sir!  - He's gone. - Sir.  - It's okay. - (EXHAUSTED): Sir.  He's gone.  (LIVELY CHATTER)  Your dog wrote an insensitive tweet.  You can't eat here.  Uh-oh, Meg. It's a sensitivity mob.  It was just a joke.  There's no such thing as jokes anymore.  Yeah, we live in a post-joke world.  Chris, maybe we should just eat outside.  No, Meg, we're eating here.  I'd like to see you try.  (""FREE BIRD"" BY LYNYRD SKYNYRD PLAYING)  I can't change   (GRUNTING)  Lord, I can't change   Won't you fly high   Free bird, yeah   (SCREAMS)    (SHOUTS)  (YELLS)  (GRUNTS)  (PANTING)  (BREATHING HEAVILY): It was a joke.  (PEOPLE CLAMORING)  Can you put on the Canucks game?  No, go away.  SEAMUS: Loser.  This is getting out of control.  We can't leave the house without getting harassed.  Yeah, yesterday I went outside to try to get the mail  and I had a seizure.  That may not be protester-related,  but still, you got to do something, Brian.  What do you want me to do?  I-I deleted my Twitter account, my Instagram,  Facebook, everything.  People still won't leave me alone.  You have to apologize.  Go outside, do it now.  Tell them that it was a mistake and how sorry you are  and maybe they'll get off our backs.  Maybe you're right.  I got to face them and hope they'll forgive me.

It's whoever.  WOMAN 3: Actually, it's whomever.  WOMAN 2: No one likes you, Mary.  (PEOPLE CLAMORING)  All right, all right, just-just calm down, okay?  WOMAN 4: Now you're tone policing us!  MAN 4: That makes me uncomfortable.  Anything that makes me uncomfortable in 2017  should be illegal.  - You know what? (BLEEP) you. - (ALL GASP)  I'm not a racist, all right? I just told a bad joke.  There's a huge difference.  But nobody on the Internet ever takes the time  to ask themselves, ""Is this worth freaking out over?""  Or, ""Are there bigger problems in the world than this tweet?""  Well, I assure you, there are.  And just for the record, I love black people.  I watch tons of black porn.  So, what do you all want from me, huh?  You-you want to ruin my life?  Then congratulations. You did it.  Everybody hates me.  I can't leave the house without getting harassed.  No one will hire me.  STEWIE: That was a problem before.  I can't turn on my phone without strangers telling me  to kill myself or that they're gonna kill my family.  Leave me alone!  I'm the self-righteous, liberal douchebag, not you!  I've kissed a transsexual before!  How many of you can say that?!  Where's my (BLEEP) medal?!  I am so far left,  I'm spinning in circles, you (BLEEP).  Instead of killing myself, I should kill all of you!  I'd like to see you try.  (""FREE BIRD"" BY LYNYRD SKYNYRD PLAYING)  Ow! Jeez.  (PEOPLE CLAMORING)  Well, we started the dialogue.  You screamed ""black porn"" at the top of your lungs  in front of women and children.  I am not the person those people out there say I am.  I know that, but you also haven't done much  to prove that you aren't.  I know, I know.  All I have left is you guys.  Thank God you have my back.  - We think you should move out. - What?!  - (LOUD THUD) - Oh! Brian, listen, we love you,  but they're throwing things at our house.  We've got to keep our family safe.  I'm sorry. It's for the best.  Are you serious?! You're okay with this?!  Does this slow pan across our disapproving faces  answer your question?  I saw Baywatch.  That thing was frickin' rad.  I still think this is a drastic measure.  Yeah, I messed up,  but what about all the stupid things Peter's done?  He's never been kicked out and his life  My life is not the issue here.  Peter, calm down.  Did you eat breakfast this morning?  I had a banana and a coffee.  Why am I so fat?  I'm sorry, Brian, but this is the way it has to be.  All right, then.  I guess this is good-bye.  Brian, wait.  This collar is ours.  It has our address on it.  Peace, dude.  All right, radio, time for you to tell me what this all means.

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    JEFF PROBST: Previously on Family Guy  Certain of his own wit and intellect,  Brian opened up a Twitter account.  If you ask me, Twitter is the perfect place for that guy,  because he's a twit.  PROBST: But an off-color tweet suddenly made Brian  a pariah to all of Quahog,  forcing the family to make the difficult choice  of sending him to a crappy apartment  on the other side of town.  Brian, the family has spoken.  You know, you're the only man in America  who looks good in sandals and cargo shorts.  Good luck, everyone. I'll miss you.  Uhp, something's comin'!    MAN: Brian. Brian!  I said you're a week late on your rent.  Well, I can get you the money. Hang-hang on.  - Let me just make a call. - (LINE RINGING)  LOIS (RECORDED): Hello. You've reached  - LOIS/PETER/MEG/STEWIE: The Griffins! - CHRIS: Chris!  STEWIE: See that? I told you we should've rehearsed this.  - PETER: Lois, can we do it over? - LOIS: No, that's eight times.  - Just leave a message. - CHRIS: I'm sorry.  - (BEEP) - Hey, guys.  It's me again. Brian.  We haven't talked since I moved out,  so I figured, you know, 10:00,  you're probably on the couch watching Pawn Stars.  So, uh, pick up.  Pick up?  Uh, da, da, da, da, da, da.  Maybe you went out.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  Da, da, da  Ooh-wa, ooh  Okay. Well, again, it's Brian.  Um, guys, really, really, call me back.  - It's Brian. Bye. - (BEEP)  So, what do you think?  Is your family gonna give you money for the rent?  Yeah, I'm thinking no.  Well, you got to do something, Brian.  - You're a week behind. - Okay, okay.  Look, I'll get a job, okay?  There's got to be something I can do.  It's not like I'm Ringo.  Well, lads, what do you think of the new album cover?  Great, but it won't look good when it's shrunk down for a CD.  CD? What's a CD?  A digital compact disc.  Ringo, are you from the future?  Yeah. And I outlive two of you.  - Which two? - Yeah, come on, Ringo. Tell us.  Okay, but you all have to agree to do my song about the octopus.  Hey, before you tell us,  I'm gonna go and smoke a thousand cigarettes.  And I'm gonna move to New York City  and walk in and out of my building.  Okay, everybody, time to go to Grandma and Grandpa's house.  - They're dead. - Not your grandparents, Peter.  I'm talking about my parents.  I hate going there.  I'm not allowed to touch anything in their house.  And, besides, today's Dolph Lundgren's birthday,  and me and the guys always celebrate it  by watching Rocky IV.  Fine, we're probably better off without you.  You always find a way to embarrass us at my parents'.  (CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING)  Please pass the All Fruit.  Pass the Polaner All Fruit.  LOIS: Pass the Polaner All Fruit.  (SOUTHERN ACCENT): Would you please pass the jelly?  - (TRAY CLANGS) - (BABS GROANS)  Hi. We're concerned that many of you Family Guy fans under 40  didn't get that reference,  so I'm gonna take you through the actual commercial.  Okay, typical '80s stuffy brunch.  Please pass the All Fruit.  Clearly the matriarch. She's got the most pearls.  Pass the Polaner All Fruit.  Weird sexual tension there.  WOMAN: Pass the Polaner All Fruit.  Okay, okay, watch. Here's where it all goes to hell.  (SOUTHERN ACCENT): Would you please pass the jelly?  - (CRASHING) - (GROANS)  See? He called it jelly.  See All right, now, what I don't get is,  if they know this guy, why are they surprised  by the way he talks? Right?  And if they don't know him, why is he at the table?  Okay, now you have the information  that would've made that funny had you had it going in.  All right, you ready to watch Rocky IV?  - Let's do it! - Yeah!  Happy Dolph Lundgren Day!  (STATIC)  What the what the hell?  Try blowing on it.  (BLOWING)  - (STATIC) - Crap! It doesn't work!  Well, we got to watch the movie. It's our tradition.  We could just stream it on your Apple TV.  Is that what that is? I thought it was a coaster.  I've been putting cold, wet things on it for a month.  Turn it on. I'm sure we can find Rocky IV on there.  I don't know how to turn it on. It doesn't have any buttons.  Well, maybe it's voice-activated.  Rocky IV! Rocky IV!  Let's just go to the damn store.  Hold on, hold on, let me try screaming at the PlayStation.  Hey, you guys, why the long faces?  Eh, we were trying to watch Rocky IV  and our DVD didn't work.  And that's just Scottie Pippen.  When I was a baby,  they pulled me out of my moms real slow.  We got a bin of old movies.  Rocky IV might be in there.  Let's see.  Talladega Nights, everywhere.  Ladybugs, classic Rodney.  A Million Ways to Die in the West, no, thank you.  Here it is! Rocky IV!  Aw, nuts, this one's written in terrorism.  That's, uh, Cyrillic.  It's a Russian bootleg.  All right, we'll take it. It's better than nothing.  NOTHING: Hey!  Welcome aboard, Brian. This is your coworker, Martha.  Pleased to meet you, Brian.  Pleasure's all mine. So, any advice?  Well, there's a script you can go off of, if you want.  Ah, script. Now you're talking my language.  (CHUCKLES) Writer.  So, watch out, or you might end up in one of my scripts.  ""Martha, gorgeous, headstrong,  legs as long as spaghetti noodles, enters.""  (PHONE RINGS)  Why don't you just take your first call?  Suicide hotline.  STEWIE: Hey, I'm a pathetic dog whose family kicked him out,  and I want to kill myself.  - Stewie? - Hey, Brian!  How's the new job going?    All right, here comes the fight.  Get ready to eat it, Drago!  (BELL DINGS)  RUSSIAN ANNOUNCER: And Balboa is down!  Drago wins!  (CROWD CHEERING)  - What the hell? - Son of a bitch!  Those Ruski bastards changed the movie so Drago wins!  Yeah! Rocky gets up!  Not only does he not get up,  he's holding a sign that says, ""Workers of the world, unite!""  Well, that-that seems like a logical idea,  but this aggression will not stand!  I'm writing Vladimir Putin an angry e-mail.  ""Dear Vladimir""  Ho-ho! That's telling him.  ""I hope this e-mail finds you well.""  Oh, man, I wish I could see his face.  ""I'll get right to the point.  My friends and I were aghast  when we saw what you did to the end of Rocky IV.  Everyone knows that any American  can beat up any Russian on any day of the week.  Other than that, all is well on this end.  Chris continues to hit the books as best he can,  and his grades have shown some improvement.  Stewie is growing like a weed.  And Meg has become a woman in front of our very eyes.""  And send.  I think we lost a little steam there at the end.  ANNOUNCER: We now return to Captain America: Civil Union.  All right, Captain America, we have to get ready  for the big fight with the other heroes.  - Who do we have on our side? - Well, Hawkeye, we've got you,  Scarlet Witch, the Falcon, and, of course, Randy.  - Who's Randy? - You know Randy.  Lives in my guesthouse.  We've been friends since college.  He's my pal.  He's the guy I went to Paris with.  You are such a coward!  Randy!  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Vladimir Putin?!  Da. Where is bathroom?  I George Brett myself on plane.  Gross!  You can Google that during the commercial.  Oh, my God. President Putin?  What-what are you doing here?  Husband write me impertinent e-mail.  Says any American can beat up any Russian.  I am here to prove him wrong.  You're gonna beat up my husband?  Unless he American chicken.    Did you just call me chicken?  Yes. Chicken.  Fi-cray! Fi-cray! Fi-cray!  Sound different in Russia.  Nobody calls me chicken.  Outside, now.  Hi, we're from Publishers Clearing House.  I have a million-dollar check for someone named Chicken.  (GASPS) A conflict!  You're going down!  - Kick his ass, Peter! - Yeah, kick his ass!  Punch his ass, Peter!  (GRUNTING)  Oh, pretty quick, huh?  Well, how about this? (GRUNTS)  (GROANING)  Here comes the haymaker!  (GRUNTING)  (STRAINED): You had enough?  (GROANING)  He gone.  - Peter! - (PHONE VIBRATING)  Oh, looks like Putin's phone is buzzing.  - (KEYS CLACKING) - Brian?  Oh, hey, Marth a.  - What are you doing here? - I'm always here.  Suicide is not a nine-to-five problem.  (PHONE RINGS)  Yeah, so I was thinking,  maybe we could Netflix and grill.  I think it's ""Netflix and chill.""  Oh. Good, 'cause I don't have a grill.  Hey, do you have Netflix?  The credit card numbers I've been guessing  keep getting rejected.  Good night, Brian.  Well, nothing says I can't date her up here.  Let's see what kind of Facebook account we got for this Martha.  Uhp, private account.  But sister.  Similar age. Few parties they went to together.  Ooh, ""Grandpa's Funeral.""  Baby look good in black.  That's her mom?  Damn. I can work with this.  You know, this is exactly what Dr. Fishbein was talking about.  I never go for it.  Martha   You're playing hide and seek   With love   Martha   This is what Dr. Fishbein   Was talking about   Martha   With a little bit of love   And a whole lot of sass   You know what, Brian, I will  (GASPS) Oh, my God!  Gross! You scumbag!  Dr. Fishbein predicted it'd be three years of treatment   And Martha's only six months in   Come on, Marth a.  Martha   It's gonna work out.   I'll tell you something, if he were here right now,  I'd kick his ass.  Just like hundreds of dead journalists,  I'm not afraid of Vladimir Putin.  Hello? Is it me you're looking for?  Yes!  (WHISTLES ""WE'RE IN THE MONEY"")  Peter, you not coward I thought.  You put up impressive fight.  Thanks, Vladimir.  You know, as someone who doesn't read the paper  or listen to the news, you're not such a bad guy.  Well, thank you.  To show there are no hard feelings,  anyone want to go to strip club  and look at some cat emojis with me?  - Hell yeah. - I'm up for the strip club.  Great. Who's driving?  You know, you're gonna think I'm crazy, but it's such a nice day,  I was kind of thinking of taking my shirt off  and riding a horse there.  Get out.  That's totally my thing!  - (HORNS HONKING) - (ANGRY CLAMORING)  Ah, the sun feels good on my drunk chest.  You know what, you're a good guy, Peter.  Friend?  How do you say ""friend"" in Russian?  There is no Russian word for it.  Well, you're my friend now. Funny how this worked out.  Who would have thought, huh?  I guess things not always what they seem.  Yeah. I mean, except for Ronan Farrow, who is clearly  Woody Allen's son and absolutely not Frank Sinatra's.  I.. You know, I-I'm glad you could make it home  for the family dinner, Ronan.  You got it, four eyes. Wouldn't miss a dinner  with my cuckoo dad for the world.  Hey, Anna May Wong, no tickie, no shirtie.  I'm just kidding around, rice bowl. Geez, lighten up.  This room is tighter than Ava Gardner's caboose.  Us, right?  It's like lookin' in a mirror.  Well, Peter, thank you for showing me Quahog.  Ah, it was fun.  I'm gonna miss you, Vladimir.  So come with me back to Russia.  I need friend.  Ah, I'm flattered, but my home is here.  And besides, I can't go to Russia.  I'm scared of Brigitte Nielsen.  She is here with you in your country.  She-she's here now? Is she  O All ri Okay, okay, let's go.  Let's go, let's go, let's go, wheels up, let's go!  Oh, my God, she can smell the tiny bottles of booze.  We got to go! We got to go now!  (SCREAMS)  Dear Lord, please send me a six-foot-seven blonde woman  who likes to drink until she blacks out.  (CRASH)  HERBERT: I think we got our prayers crossed.    Welcome to Russia, Peter.  Man, Russia has the hottest and ugliest women in the world.  All tens and ones.  Wow! Whoa.  Wow! Whoa.  - Wow! Whoa. - Whoa.  Aw, I'm a ""whoa.""  I know what'll cheer you up.  We listen to funny morning zoo on radio.  DJ: You're listening to backwards-K-FMB.  I am The Penis, here with Buttocks.  - Hello, Buttocks. - (FARTING SOUNDS)  Ha. Humor.  Now time for government-approved prank phone call.  (DIALING)  (LINE RINGING)  MAN: What?  DJ: Is your refrigerator running?  MAN: Yes.  DJ: You are very fortunate.  I've tried everything, Lou. I told her I was sorry.  I even sent flowers.  She's gonna report me, and I'm gonna get fired.  Wh-What can I do?  Do what I do when people don't pay their rent:  plant drugs and call the cops.  I don't know, I-I may be broke,  but that seems like a crappy thing to do to somebody.  Well, then you're evicted.  (SIGHS) Okay, fine.  But where am I gonna get drugs?  Walk me to my car. My trunk is full of coke.  Brian Griffin?  Your life's about to change.  Brian Griffin?  We're not having a lot of luck today.

I just wanted to let you know I'm not going to tell anyone  about what happened, and  maybe we could get that drink tomorrow.  Tell 'em you have no idea how your hair strands  got in that baggie. Hello, Officer!  - Is this your desk, ma'am? - Yeah. Why, Officer?  Found it.  - What is that? - Like you don't know.  Cocaine. Glorious cocaine.  Best thing ever.  You're gonna have to come with us.  And, Jeff, you might want to call your sponsor.  You did this, didn't you?  I knew you were a little twerp as soon as I met you.  He did this! He planted that!

Brian, why are you dressed like a douche  who hangs out with multiracial friends  in a McDonald's commercial?  (CHUCKLES): Okay.  All right, that'll do.  Well, I'm heading out. See y'all.  Hey, Brian, that hat makes you look like a wang.  Squat and white with a dark mushroom cap,  - like Michael Jackson. - Is that true?  Yes.  Let me guess, Bri. You're off to try and get laid  - at some sad nightclub. - Shut up, Stewie.  I'm not just out for sex.  I want a woman who I can spend the rest of my life with.  I simply haven't found her yet.  And you never will, because the truth is  you're a selfish horndog who's getting too old for the game.  I beg to differ. I think I've got the lingo  of today's lady down pat.  Hey. Might I Pinterest you in a drink-point-oh?    Ladies.  How about the Verizon guy moving over to Sprint? Huh?  That seems kind of wack, right?  - Like, zero chill. - I can't understand you.

Oh, I need time.  I'm still recovering from that one thing you did  that was so obscene, it couldn't even be described  on lame, dying network TV.  Have you always been so  Freaky? No. But when I got my diagnosis,  I made a bucket list of wild sex stuff I want to try.  Jess, I would like to help you cross offos  every single item on this list.  Aw. You would do that for me?  All except for number 17.  I'm allergic to chocolate.  But isn't that only I?  You know what? Let me make a phone call.    Oh   Yeah!

I really enjoy spending time with this woman,  and I don't want you ruining it for me.  - Okay, okay, promise. - Of course. We got it.  Lois, you didn't have to go through all this trouble.  It's like a whole Thanksgiving dinner.  Oh, it's no problem, Jess.  We're happy to have you.  Chris, pass me a turkey leg, would you?  I prefer the limbs.  I got a ""limb fo' Ma.""  Uh, let's stop talking about the food. All right?  Anyone seen any good movies lately?  I saw that new Tom Hanks movie.  Oh, man, I love every Tom Hanks movie,  except The Terminal.  There's nothing worse than when you're flipping channels,  and you're like, ""Oh, God, it's Terminal.  ""Don't say it's Terminal.  ""God, what have I done to deserve this?  Why does it have to be Terminal?!""  Sir, I will tell you a great Tom Hanks movie:  Catch Me If You Can, sir.  You have literally never called Peter ""sir.""  Well, I've never told you that I can't throw a boomerang,  but it's true.  See? I told you. But at least I don't have cancer,  - like your girlfriend. - That's it.  I'm getting you out ofere.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  I like your family. They're scumbags.  I like you.  No, Jess  I really like you.  I can't remember the last time I felt this happy.    (BRIAN MOANING SOFTLY)  I feel dizzy.  Me, too.  This all happened so fast, I  Jess? Are you okay?  Jess?  Are you guys still leaving?  Oh. Yeah. Sorry.  (SIGHS)    (DOOR OPENS)  Wait, where's Dr. Hartman?  I'm afraid Jess's condition is too serious  to be announced by Dr. Hartman.  So they sent me, Dr. Gravitas.  - Oh boy. - Uh-oh.  Jess, I'll come right out and say it.  The cancer did not respond to treatment  and has spread throughout your body.  You've got approximately two weeks left to live.  Oh, my God.  Oh  (SOBBING)  (SIGHS) I'm so sorry, Jess.  If there's anything I can do  No, you've been great.  I mean, you don't even need to be here right now.  I'm just some woman  who never got to have the career she wanted  or get married or have kids.  (SOBBING)  One of those things you can do.  It would be my honor  if you spent the rest of your life  as my bride.  Oh, Brian. Yes!    (PHONE RINGS)  Oh, this is my vet.  Hello?  Oh, great.  Well, some good news.  That chocolate thing from the bucket list?  We're all good. Let's do it.  Toblerone probably isn't the best thing for this.    Brian? It would mean the world to me  if you wore my tux from when I got married.  I love you, buddy.  Yeah, I'm not wearing a fat guy's old clothes.  And Wha Is this a flap on the butt of these pants?  Yup. In case of emergencies.  My invention. Called it the Suit-Chute.  Got it patented in '97 and went into business.  Shot a local commercial and everything.  I'm Peter Griffin, inventor of the Suit-Chute.  Are you about to walk down the aisle  and afraid you'll leave it brown?  Did you eat creamy soup just before the opera?  Are you George Brett at an awards ceremony?  Then you need a tux with the Suit-Chute.  Don't take my word for it.  Ask famous Hollywood actor- slash-pants filler Dennis Franz.  On NYPD Blue, I'm known for packin' heat.  But every year when I go to the Emmys,  the heat I'm packin' is clumpy and smells terrible.  Not anymore, thanks to the Suit-Chute.  And the winner is  your socks and shoes.  The business died, and I lost $200,000, Brian.  Want to know why?  ""555"" means it is not an actual phone number.  I truly wish I had known that.  Brian, I want nothing to do with this sham wedding.  So if you're going to ask me to be your best man, don't.  I'm not. I want you to be the ring bearer,  and wear a vest and a boutonniere  - and carry a satin pillow - Sold, sold. Yes, I'm in.  But it's still wrong. There's no way  you'd be marrying this woman if she wasn't going to die  - in two weeks. - Oh, come on!  Did you know that Lois was so moved  she called Channel Five to do a profile of me and Jess?  And now get out your tissues, it's a real-life Quahog version  of The Fault in Our Stars,  the novel and hit movie your gay nephew quotes on Facebook.    My name is Jess.  I have cancer.  But cancer doesn't have me.  My name is Brian.  I have a disease  called love.  It may have started in my penis,  but it spread to my heart.    And, Brian, when you learned Jess had only weeks to live,  you proposed.  Yep. Got in right under the wire.  No one's ever loved me like Brian does.  You know, sometimes at night I just watch Jess sleep for hours.  And I go, ""Hey. Hey, you alive?""  And she says, ""Yeah,"" and then I go, ""All right, good.""  (SNIFFLES) I'm, uh I'm sorry.  (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry to be a puss.  Hey, pal.  Listen, I kn-I know we've had our differences,  - but you're a good guy. - Thank you, Quagmire.  Listen, I want to throw you the wildest bachelor party  of all time. It's gonna be crazier  than whatever Kanye West is doing at this particular moment.  I'm giving this lasagna a massage  while preparing to announce I'm joining ISIS.  Thank you for your interest.  This is delicious.  Hmm. I still think the butter cream  was the best cake I've thrown up so far.  Oh, speaking of which. Mwah!  Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you.  A-Are you the dog who's marrying the cancer girl?  Oh, uh, yeah, I am.  Oh, my God, we saw you on the news last night!  You are just the best person. I can't even.  How's she doing?  Honestly, not well.  She's only got ten days.  So in ten days you'll be alone?  I guess.  Well, maybe not.  I'll give you my number.  Here, I'll put my number in with my tongue.  Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.  I'm not sure that's a complete number,  but I'm gonna call you first.  Wow. I haven't gotten this kind of attention  since I went to see The Peanuts Movie.  - Look. - There he is.  That's him.  That's the guy who peed in his empty soda cup.  (CRYING)  (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)  Hello, Brian, I'm Jess's mother, Helen.  Oh, hey.  L-Listen, I've been wanting to talk to you.  I-I was thinking maybe you could move in with me and Jess,  because I-I know you'd want to be with her for her final days.  Well, now, thank you, Brian.  That is such a sweet offer. I would love to be there.  Now, you have a blessed day.  (CHUCKLING): Oh Oh, no.  We's all gathered here  to join this couple in holy matrimony.  (SIGHS) Yet another wedding  I'm on this side of, Jeffrey.  We's just waiting for his mama to die.  (SINGSONGY): We've written our own vows.  PETER: Oh, no.  Brian, I I haven't known you that long.  But these past weeks  I feel like you've given me a lifetime of love.  I vow to honor you and cherish you  until the day I die,  a week from Wednesday.  I'm so happy to place this ring  on the weird dog thumb you have halfway up your arm.  Jess, I wish we had a million years together.  But what we have is this moment,  and I wouldn't trade it for anything.  With this ring, I vow to honor you and cherish you  for the rest of the month.  Ma'am, do you take this doggie to be your husband?  I do.  Yay!  How about you, doggie?  Samesies?  - I do. - Yay, again!  By the power bottom vested in me,  I now pronounce y'all husband and wife.  Kiss!  WOMAN: Aw.  Everyone! Your attention, please!  Dr. Gravitas?  That's right.  I want to give you two your first gift.  These are your latest test results, Jess.  And they're remarkable.  Meaning what?  Meaning Jess is going to live.  (GUESTS GASP, CHEER)    Brian, we really will be together forever.  Forever and ever and ever!  Can you believe this?  What?  Jess is gonna live.  I-I'm sorry, I took a-a muscle relaxer this morning.  Tinazidine.  Before you drove here?!  Yeah, I took half of one before I got in the car.  And then another half at a red light.  It's fine, it's Tinazidine.  I-I might take another half.  You want a half?  Oh, no.  Come on. It was prescribed by a doctor  to a guy named John Selvaggio  who has a mailbox that he can't see from his front yard.  It's Tinazidine.  Stop saying what it is.  ANNOUNCER: Tinazidine:  the white, plastic pouch in your neighbor's mailbox  that might be three months of drugs.  Oh, my God. It is so incredible  having my appetite back.  Mm.  I love you.  Ah, shrimp.  It's like I'm a baby bird.  (SPITS, LAUGHS)  This turn me on, too.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  (FARTS)  Brian, did you hear that?  Mm-hmm.  Remember what the doctor said?  Flatulence means my digestive system is working again.  Oh, my God, I must have, like,  six months worth of cancer-farts built up.  (SHORT FARTS)  (LONG FART)  (GIGGLES)  MAN (IN DISTANCE): Would you stop farting, please?  This is a nice hotel.  - Okay, that's the last box. - (MEWING)  Aw, you're so glad to be back with me, aren't you?  Mommy was so sad  when she had to put you all up for adoption.  Yes, she was.  Ooh, I'm going straight to the kitchen  to make my favorite meal in a tiny apartment:  microwaved salmon.  (SHORT FARTS)  (FARTS CONTINUE WITH EACH STEP)  (SIGHS)  MAN: Welcome back, Brian.  - (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) - AUDIENCE MEMBER: That's Lou,  the apartment manager from when Brian moved out.  Ain't that somethin' to flip your biscuit.  (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)  What?  That's my thing I say, remember?  Oh. Uh, no.  I-I can't imagine anyone does.  Hey, listen, thanks for renting to us  even though we have ten cats and couldn't make the deposit.  Spent, uh, pretty much every last penny on our wedding.  (CHUCKLES) Dead broke.  Ain't that somethin' to flip your biscuit.  (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)  (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)  - So, Bri, this - (APPLAUSE SLOWLY STOPS)  So, Bri, this is once again your hellhole.  I was going to help you move in  but you don't really own anything, do you?  Yeah, we didn't bother to register for giftsis  because she was supposed to die!  I must say, she's looking healthy.  Putting those Juicy pants to the test.  (WHISPERING): Stewie, I've got to get out of this.  You were right all along, okay?  I'm not ready to be married.  I-I gotta I gotta get a divorce.  Oh, that'll go over well after you paraded  your ""great love"" around town.  Which reminds me, your follow-up Tom Tucker profile  is coming on now.  We got countless letters  after our profile of the Cancer Girl  who won her sweetheart's paw in marriage.  Turns out their story has a very happy ending.  Due to audio issues, the following footage is subtitled.  (CONTINUOUS FARTING)  (MEWING)  Brian, look.  - Holy - I know.  My hair's growing back.  What do you think?  You look like a baby doll found in hurricane rubble.  Aw, I'm your baby doll.  - (KNOCKING) - I'll get it.  (QUIETLY): Ain't that somethin' to flip your biscuit?  Nothing?  (AUDIENCE MEMBER COUGHS)  Oh, hey, Helen. What are you doing here?  Coming to live with you, like you asked me to at the wedding.  Are-are you watching HBO?  I'm a Christian woman, Brian.  Cancel HBO now.  We can spend the extra money  on the big photos of fetuses I hold  while I yell at people outside Panera.  JESS: Mom, guess what?  - My farts are back. - (SHORT HIGH-PITCHED FART)  - JESS'S MOM: Mine never went away. - (LOW FART)  - (BOTH LAUGH) - JESS: Oh, man.  - Uh-huh. - So the crazy ex-girlfriend  - sings this hilarious song. - Uh-huh.  It's all about how she's having her period,  but the other guy she wanted to impress  The one who created the social media app  He walks in while she's singing,  so now he's not into her, either.  Uh-huh.  - Will you get me more salsa? - Uh-huh.  Brian.  Will you get me more salsa?  Huh? Sorry. Got it.  They only had mild.  (GAGGING)  (COUGHING, CHOKING)  Well, I'm sorry it's so disgusting,  but that's all they have.  Oh, you're gonna die if you have to eat mild salsa?  Come on.  (CHOKING)  Wait, are you Oh, my G  Oh, my God, are you choking?  She's Someone I don't  Heimlich maneuver.  How do you do the Heimlich maneuver?  Come on, come on.  Damn it. I've got one song by Haim on my phone?  And every time I try to type ""Heimlich"", it    (GASPING)  Oh, my God. Somebody call 911!  Damn it, Fox.  That's not an invitation to ruin our moment  to expand your media empire.  (SIGHS)  Son of Zorn.  Ha.  (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)  (CRYING)  I'd like to thank you all for coming  to honor the memory of my beloved wife Jess  Uh  I'm sorry, I'm just realizing I never caught her last name.  - JESS'S MOM: Schlotz. - Yikes.  It was my husband's name.  What's your maiden name?  Borgwort.  PETER: That's also bad.  Look, all I want to say is  I always knew this day was coming.  But what I didn't know was  just how much I was gonna miss Jess.  I would give anything  if she were still here with me.  (GASPS)  I'm okay.  It's a miracle!  (SOBBING)"

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    ANNOUNCER: Previously, on Family Guy  Hey, who wants to play ""Drink the Beer""?  - Right here. - Heh. You win!  - All right! What do I win? - Another beer!  More recently, and better, on Family Guy  PETER: All right, you ready? All right, one, two, three.  - (GRUNTING) - Okay, all right.  - Uh, okay. All right. - Easy, easy, easy, easy.  Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, stop, stop, stop,  - stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. - What? What? What?  - No, no, no, no. Twist it. - What? I am.  - No. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. - I I  Other way, other way, you're twisting it the wrong way.  Even more recently, and not quite as good, on  Family Guy  Jess is going to live!    (FARTING)  Brian, did you hear that?  Mm-hmm.  Stewie, I've got to get out of this.  And now, the current, better-than-the-pilot-  but-not-as-good- as-Star-Wars-episode  of Family Guy.  Sorry it took us so long to have dinner together.  Oh, that's okay. You were busy  being dead.  - (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) - (BRIAN FAKE-LAUGHING)  Did you warn this guy when he married you  he also married your friends?  - (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) - (BRIAN FAKE-LAUGHING)  I love his laugh!  - (HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER) - Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Ah-ha-ha-ha!  Oh, Meg, you have to babysit for Stewie Saturday.  - Nope. - Okay. Chris, you have to do it.  What? That's not fair.  - I have a party to go to. - Sorry, Meg found pictures  on your father's computer, and she's blackmailing us.  She can do what she wants till we get some dirt on her.  I didn't know it was supposed to be hard  before I took the picture.  (WHISTLING A TUNE)  Oh, hey, Peter. Be with you in a sec.  - I'm burning the place down. - You got the bedbugs?  That don't make sense. This isn't the Red Rock Motor Lodge  in Montgomery, Alabama.  Please send the lawsuit to our lawyer,  whose address is below.  That's right, she's also a lawyer.  The mystery deepens.  I don't have bedbugs. I'm burning it down  so I can fake my own death.  Can you throw me that white fur coat  - filled with HoneyBaked hams? - What?  (SOBBING): I just I can't take it, Peter.  I thought I could marry Jess, but it's awful!  I can't live this way!  Hey, relax. You're married now.  You don't have to worry about nothin'.  Everything's done for you.  I mean, I literally don't know where socks come from.  No idea. Do they come from trees?  From bushes? I don't know.  Get a hole in one, new pair shows up  in my drawer, just like that.  Food, too. I chucked the mustard onto the front lawn last week.  That night, back in the fridge.  That would be kind of nice.  Listen, stick with me.  We're gonna have a great adventure,  like the astronaut who thinks the lowest number is three.  MAN (OVER SPEAKERS): And liftoff in five, four,  - three - ASTRONAUT: Whoa!  - two, one - Oh.  - liftoff. - Whoa!  This is our spot, Brian.  A place just for married guys like you and me.  Husbands Restaurant?  I've never seen this place before.  - Is it new? - Nope. Been here for 30 years.  You just can't see it until you get married.  Watch. Take your ring off.  - Wow! - Wearing the ring  also makes you wear giant khaki shorts  with a belt and a lot of keys rattling around in the pockets.  - (KEYS JANGLE) - You're right!  What are all these keys for?  A series of sheds.  I got a lot of sheds back home.  Oh. You have more than one shed?  'Course. You always need an extra shed.  I even got one shed that just has an extra shed in it.  - You guys talking about sheds? - Hell yes. I love my sheds.  - Me, too. - High five on sheds.  Sheds!  (BLEATING LIKE SHEEP): Sheds  sheds sheds sheds  Are those really Tom Arnold's sweatpants in that frame?  Yep. That's the Husbands wall of heroes.  There are a lot of fat guys here.  Well, yeah, Brian. Every man's true weight  is at least 20 pounds heavier than how they look.  You know how much energy it takes to hold all that in?  You can finally let go.  Just relax. Exhale for once.  Exhale like you never have to attract  a pretty woman ever again.  (INHALES)  (EXHALES)  Wow, that feels amazing.  Now, let's order some food. I'm starving.  Nice to meet you, Starving. I'm Brian.  (ELECTRONIC BEEPING)  (PAGER VIBRATES)  Oh, looks like they really want me to come to that party.  - We're gonna have to go. - You you have a pager?  - Yeah. - You get paged?  Yeah, that's how a pager works.  Why don't you just get a phone?  Um, you mean one of your government tracking devices?  No, thanks. I'm using a pager.  ""Oh, you're looking at your steps?""  No, the government's watching where you're going.  It's not nap time, Stewie. Wake up.  All right, we're out of here.  Okay, Stewie's going to the party.  - Yeah, but where's Chris going? - I have no idea!  He's completely off the grid!  Damn it! He can't hide forever.  (BEEPING)  Where are you?  Boy, this really is a high school party.  Complete with the popular kid who's clearly going to die  in a car accident tonight.  Hey, Jagger, can you help out at the soup kitchen  - tomorrow at noon? - Sure. I should be alive then.  Yeah, he gone.  I see we're smoking.  We're not smoking. We're vaping.  - What's the difference? - Smoking is for losers.  Vaping is for douchebags.  Aw. I want to be a douchebag.  Do you own 19 hats?  I only have one, but it's a Stussy hat with a flat brim.  Have a seat.  (INHALES)  Whoo-hoo, it's delightful!  Chris! Chris, isn't this cool?  Stewie, don't say my name! There's an Alexa in here!  Sir, we have eyes on Chris.  He's at a douchebag vaping party.  Sooner or later, they all get sloppy.  (CRUNCHING)  I got to say, Bri, the guys at Husbands  are a little worried about you.  They said you had four  Scott Peterson fish sandwiches yesterday.  Fireball?  No, because I'm not a Skidmore freshman  at a Lake George share-house.  Or am I?  Man, Skidmore's the best!  You said it, Pete. Race you to the raft?  - (LAUGHS) - You're on!  Yeah, let's go!  PETER: But the water was too shallow.  Bryce broke his neck and never walked again.  This put an end to off-campus drinking  and lake house rentals.  I was just fine.  I landed on Bryce.    JESS'S MOM: He's starting to smell.  He needs a bath.  JESS: He doesn't like baths.  JESS'S MOM: And I see you lost the alcohol argument.  Can't you hear them talking about you?  Yeah. I'm a dog, I can hear everything.  By the way, the Stranger Things monster just farted.  Whew! Must have been that fat chick I ate.  - Time for dinner, guys. - Awesome. I'm starving.  - (LOUD CRACK) - Oh!  Oh  Holy crap! Brian, you okay?  (GRUNTING LOUDLY)  Keep it down up there!  (GRUNTING STOPS)  Holy crap, Hal, what's wrong with you?  (CHUCKLES) You love it.  How does it look, Doc?  I'm sorry to say you have hip dysplasia.  What's that?  I'm not re what dysplasia is, but I do know  you don't often see a ""Y"" that far up in a word.  I took the liberty of X-raying my own hip  to show you what a normal one looks like.  Why does it look like there's a Batmobile in your colon?  Just keep your eyes on the hips.  So, what's the next step?  I was hoping, whenever the Bat-Signal goes up in the sky,  - this thing will just drive out. - Uh, no. For Brian.  Ah. Well, wouldn't hurt to lose some weight.  And he won't be able to walk until his hip heals.  He'll need someone to take care of him.  I'll take care of him.  Like you took care of me when I was sick.  Come back in a week, we can check your pfft-pfft.  What is that?  That's the sound a blood pressure machine makes.  I do impressions for the doctor talent show.  Do you know what this is?  Braaap! Braaap!  An MRI?  Yes! Adding that to my set.  (TOILET FLUSHING)  Oh, my God.  - Where there's smoke, there's - Just me vaping.  Stewie, if Mom and Dad see you with that thing,  they'll kill me.  Get rid of it!  No way. It's awesome. Watch this.  (INHALES)  I'm not good at the football part.  (SNIFFS) It smells like raspberry.  Yeah. It's basically the same as eating fruit.  - Vaping isn't bad for you? - It can't be bad for you  if Stephen Dorff gave up acting for it.  It does seem like they're making it for kids.  This flavor is ""baby formula.""  Let me try.  (INHALES)  Yummy.  Watch this.  (INHALES)  (LAUGHS)  Like the movie The Ring.  Awesome!  (BOTH SCREAM)  Come back here, you.  (SCREAMS)  Giggity, giggity, crabbity, giggity.  (""STUCK IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU"" BY STEALERS WHEEL PLAYING)  Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you   And I'm wondering what it is I should do   It's so hard to keep this smile from my face   Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place   Clowns to the left of me   Jokers to the right   Here I am   Stuck in the middle with you   Well, you started out with nothing   And you're proud that you're a self-made man     And your friends, they all come crawling   Slap you on the back and say   Ple-e-e-e-e-ease     Ple-e-e-e-e-ease     Yes, I'm stuck in the middle with you   And I'm wondering what it is I should do   It's so hard to keep this smile from my face   Losing control, yeah, I'm all over the place.   E-liquid, please.  Anything that tastes like a Fruit Roll-Up.  Good, all good.  - Good. - All good.  No worries, all good?  - We're good. - Good, all good.  Here you go.  You good? You all good?  - All good here. - Yep, we're good.  Good, all good.  This whole vaping thing was a very smart move.  It tastes great and I don't feel violently ill  as long as some of this vapor is in my lungs.  Plus, when you wake at night shaking  because you haven't had any in three hours,  it's so easy to vape more.  Let's face it, this is the most fun we've had  since Mom got hooked on coffee and bought that Alpuccino maker.  (COFFEE MACHINE, AS AL PACINO): Hoo-ah!  Thank you for having us over for dinner.  Sometimes it's been difficult to cook  with all the other things I have to do for Brian.  Oh, don't listen to her, I'm so easy.  I do have to go to the bathroom, though.  Jess really has been amazing.  (URINATING)  She even set up surgery for me to have my hip fixed.  (URINATING CONTINUES, STOPS)  Uhp, don't get fooled.  (URINATING RESUMES)  I don't know what I'd do without her.  I think I've really found true love.  - (URINATING CONTINUES) - Well, that's lovely.  You know, I don't think we've said grace yet.  - BRIAN: Oh, yeah. - Bless us, oh Lord,  for these thy gifts, which we are about to receive.  BRIAN: Get out of there, Mountain Dew.  I'm here for Brian Griffin.  Well, this is it, Jess.  See you after my hip surgery.  He won't be needing this anymore.  Thanks.  Good-bye, Brian.  You mean ""see you soon,"" right?  Wait, why won't I need my collar?  (DOGS WHINING)  So, what's this?  Kind of like a pre-op?  Are all these dogs having hip surgery?  Where do you think you are?  This isn't a doctor's office, this is the pound.  You're being euthanized.  What? Jess is having me put down?  Oh, my God, this can't be happening!  Did you also eat a kid?  Look, there's been a horrible mistake.  You've got the wrong dog.  Says right here I got to euthanize Brian Griffin,  and you're him.  You wouldn't kill a singing dog, would you?  Hello, my baby, hello, my honey   Hello, my ragtime gal.   -  - (CASH REGISTER RINGS)    (CROAKS LIKE MICHIGAN J. FROG)  WORKER: Oh, now you're getting euthanized for sure.  (INHALES)  (EXHALES)  Hi, honey.  Mommy needs money for scratchers.  What the what kind of brazen thievery is this?  Where'd you get this?  Chris Griffin! You get in here!  What is this?  Um robot penis?  Seriously, I'm absolutely jonesing right now,  so give it back.  I know what this is. I watch Bravo.  - I'm not doing it. - You are too young  - to be doing this. - Maybe it's his and he's just  - too dumb to hide it. - And if that's not bad enough,  you leave it out for Stewie to get his hands on it?  I don't know, Mom, I'm not my brother's keeper.  - He's just a baby. - Babies are stupid like that!  - I'm taking it - (GRUNTS)  and you are grounded, mister.  Now look what you did, you little son of a bitch.  She has my vaporizer.  You have to get it back.  That's your problem.  You lost your vape pen, I didn't lose mine.  Well, I guess you win.  - (GRUNTS) - (GRUNTS, CRIES)  - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS)  - (GRUNTS) - (GROANS)  (GRUNTS)  Hey. (GRUNTS)  (BOTH GRUNTING)  (BOTH SUCKING)  Oh, tastes so good, like skin berries.  I'm alive with pleasure.  (BOTH SUCKING)  It's possible we've taken this too far.  I'll just go down and get yours back.  I will never forget this day.  Mom, I need to talk to you.  Technically, that was not my vape pen,  but I do need it back because it belongs to a friend of mine.  We accidentally switched jackets,  not unlike that episode of The Brady Bunch when Greg  (COUGHS)  Oh, damn it, Chris, why do your lies have to take so damn long?  You're smoking the vape pen?  No, I'm sneaking a real cigarette  like frustrated mothers are supposed to do.  You're such a hypocrite!  At least vaping is healthy.  Oh, don't be an idiot.  Vaping is just as bad, and you look like a douchebag.  No, I don't. I look cool.  Go ahead.  Hold it to your mouth.  Oh, my God, I'm a douchebag.  (INHALES SHARPLY, CRIES)  It's okay, Chris.  Your secret's safe with me.  (PHONE CHIMES)  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Hey, what's up, Jess?  I came to see how Brian's  ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!  Sorry, I'm just making an Alpuccino.  Oh.  Well, anyway, I was just wondering  ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!  Sorry, my mom wanted one, too.  Oh, that's-that's fine.  - So is Brian - Can I get you one?  Uh, sure.  Is Brian going to, uh  ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!  When is Brian coming back?  Oh, never.  I'm having him euthanized.  Euthanized?  Oh, my God!    (TIRES SQUEALING)  Come on, come on.  (TIRES SQUEALING)  Euthanize, euthanize, euthanize  Oh, my God!  I got to do something!  Damn it. Now I have to do that with every dictionary here.  Hold on, Brian, hold on.  (DOGS WHINING)  (CAR HORN HONKING)  Don't worry, buddy. I'm on my way.  (DOGS BARKING)  I'm warning you, if you kill me, the Internet's gonna freak out.  (TIRES SQUEAL)  Please, it can't end like this.  There has to be something I can do.  Well, for 200 bucks, I'll strangle you  with my bare hands and stare into your eyes as you die.  What? I'm not paying for that.  I meant I'll pay you.  Stop! That's my dog!  Oh, Peter, thank God.  You got here just in time.  You want to make $200?  I do.  (CHOKING): It's beautiful.  What the hell are you doing here?  Brian, I can explain.  Explain what? How you brought me here to have me killed?  Well, you're no better.  You could have saved my life in the restaurant,  but you let me choke to death.  Okay, fine. I probably could have done more  to save your life.  I was just so unhappy being married, I  I guess I felt letting you Che was my only way out.  God, that sounds awful.  Maybe I did deserve to die.  W-Well, and I should've kept taking care of you,  instead of bringing you here to have you killed.  Maybe I deserve to be with someone who let me die.  Maybe we deserve each other.  It does seem like we're meant for each other.  I mean, gosh, maybe that's what true marriage is  two people who want each other to die.  PETER (CHOKING): Now you're getting it.  So much beauty.  Oh, Brian, I'm sorry that Jess died  during the commercial break,  but it was a very nice funeral service.  Yeah, it's sad.  She was the love of my life, my heart, my  ALPUCCINO MAKER: Hoo-ah!  I took that from her apartment.  So, Chris, I hear you been doing some vaping.  So douchey.  Mom, you told him?  - We had a deal. - Thanks a lot, Peter.  You promised you wouldn't say anything.  Oh, I'm supposed to keep your secret  after you lied to me about sneaking cigarettes?  What the hell, Chris? You told him, too?  - No, I didn't. - Brian told me.  Are you serious, Peter? You said you wouldn't say anything.  I promised Meg I wouldn't tell anyone.  Oh, good job with that, dick.  Chris, the only reason I told him  was he promised he'd keep his mouth shut.  Oh, nice job, Chris.  I should've known not to trust someone  who kisses his own brother.  What? Wh-Who told you that?  - Don't look at me. - Meg told me.  How does it feel, Meg, you frigging town crier?  - MEG: You're such a bitch. - PETER: She's a bitch?  Meg, you said you wouldn't tell Stewie's secret.  CHRIS: Stewie, you told Dad?  STEWIE: I had to get it off my chest.  I didn't think he'd understand me.  PETER: I understand pieces now and then."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    (DRONE BUZZING)  At last, I shall exact my vengeance  and snuff out the miserable flame  that has been your life, vile woman.  Growing one carrot   Taking up time   Filling up the day with nonsense   Vodka in the bushes   (HUMMING)  Making it better, making it bright   What a day   Think I'll check the mail.   Time to put you out of your misery.  What the deuce?  Sorry I broke your toy.  Toy? This is a drone.  Grown men who have never had sexual relations  fly them over people's houses  to try and see something. I don't know.  Here, want to play with my toy?  - What the hell is this? - It's a magic wand.  Watch. Alakazam!  I cast the tickle spell.  (BOTH GIGGLE)  Okay, okay, you got me.  But seriously, cross me again, and I will end you.  You're funny. My name's Hudson.  Want to play ""spin in a circle""?  I'm Stewie. Yeah, I don't think I  What the? Stop it!  I'm losing track of my surroundings.  Hey, this is kind of fun.  Whee!  Yes. Whee.  Whee!  (BOTH LAUGH)  (LAUGHING): Oh, my. Oh, my.  WOMAN: Hudson, time to go.  I got to go home now.  I'm glad I met you, Stewie.  You're neat. Bye.  Bye, Hudson.  I like him.  He's more fun than an Eddie Murphy bed.  And check this out.  (LAUGHS LIKE EDDIE MURPHY)  That's cool. Is it a queen?  Not sure, but people have said it is.  Wait a minute.  This is a self-empowerment seminar.  You lied to me.  You said we were going to Baskin-Robbins.  I said we were going to bask in Robbins' glow.  You know what you did.  I do.  ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.): Ladies and gentlemen,  give it up for Tony Robbins.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)    How the (BLEEP) is everyone?  MAN: Ooh, he swore. I trust this guy.  All of you here are capable of greatness.  MAN 2: Yay!  But some will never achieve it.  MAN 2: Oh, no!  You, sir.  Come out here.  Sheesh, your head is the size of a picnic watermelon.  Ha! I've been told that.  And you sound like you were lost at sea  and told not to drink seawater but drank seawater.  Peter, will you just listen to him?  Tony, this is why I brought him.  He's never willing to actually confront his issues.  Sounds like you have no self-esteem.  I don't deserve self-esteem.  Peter, I was once a lot like you:  unmotivated, dangerously obese, always relying on cutaways  You know, that reminds me of the time  No, Peter. No more cutaways.  - Stay in the present. - Okay.  Okay. Now tell me what you feel.  Uh, a partial erection.  I don't get touched very often.  You know you deserve a better life, right, Peter?  Yes. Getting hard to breathe in here.  I want to give you that life, Peter.  Time to seize your personal power.  (GASPING)  Yeah, by getting away from you, you weirdo.  But first, here's that cutaway I was gonna do  before you made me skip it.  Only now it'll make no sense.  ""Cast of Parks and Rec Peter"" away!  I can't believe you dragged me to that fraud.  That man has nothing to offer me. (SCREAMS)  (THUNDER RUMBLES)  Tony Robbins.  Listen, I don't have long.  If I get soaked in the rain, I'll be too heavy to move.  Peter, I've seen thousands of people over the years  and helped every single one of them.  I'm not going to let you be my first failure.  I told you, I don't want your help.  (WHEELS SPINNING)  Peter, I swear,  I won't stop trying to help you no matter what.  (THUNDER RUMBLES)  (TONY SCREAMS)  (TIRES SQUEAL)  Oh, my God! Peter, stop the car!  I think he got struck by lightning.  (TIRES SCREECH)  Wait, w-where is he?  He's gone.  This is freaking me out.  Are are you carrying a flask now?  This is about you getting better, not me.  (EXHALES)  Hey, there's Hudson.  (LAUGHS)  Stewie, you're, like, 100 times more advanced than that kid.  Why do you want to hang out with him so badly?  He's just, like, a cool guy.  Hi, Stewie. I'm putting sand on a cat poo.  Cool!  (SIGHS)  I like you, Stewie.  Can I come over for a playdate?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!  Brian, can Hudson come over for a playdate?  Sure, I guess so.  Never heard you ask for a playdate before.  I know, but there's a first time for everything.  Like when I finally built the Leaning Tower of Pisa  out of LEGOS.  I did it!  Mom! Come look! Mom!  LOIS: Yeah, be right there, Stewie.  Where's the bush vodka?  (LEAVES RUSTLING)  Where is it? Where is it?!  Ah, there it is.  Hi, Stewbie.  You playing with your kitty cat?  Ah, the privacy of all glass around me.  Finally, I can pick my nose.        TONY (THROUGH CAR): Hey, Peter, next time use a tissue.  - Who said that? - It's me. Tony Robbins.  Tony Robbins?  That's impossible. You're dead.  TONY: That may be true,  but the lightning bolt that killed me  seems to have magically transferred my personal power  Trademark into your car.  Peter, I told you I was going to help you,  and I'm not leaving until I make good on my promise.  Suit yourself.  Hey, if you're dead, can you ask Bill Paxton  if he's the same as Bill Pullman?  Sure. Hang on.  He said no, but he winked.  Ah!  Hey, Stewie, let's play cops and robbers.  Bang! Bang! Bang! Got you.  (CHUCKLES) Gun?  Oh, that's-that's not that's not a gun.  These are guns.  You're welcome, Paul Hogan.  Any time someone says a weapon is not what it is,  Paul Hogan gets a royalty.  Royalty check, Mr. Hogan.  PAUL HOGAN: Thanks, Jumpy.  Whoa! What are all these for?  Oh, the yoozh:  destroying enemies, world domination.  Oh, and killing my mother.  You want to hurt your mommy?  LOIS: Stewie?  Blast! Here she comes.  Well, look at the handsome little boys.  Come downstairs. I made your favorites:  grilled cheese cut to look like a dinosaur.  Ugh. They never look like a dinosaur.  - Your mom seems nice. - She's a slag.  Well, I hope you don't use your guns  to kill your mom or do anything bad.  'Cause if you do,  I won't be able to play with you,  and that's my favorite thing now.  It is?  - Uh-huh. - Mine, too.  You know what? I'm going to let her live.  I must say, I've been evil so long,  I've forgotten what it's like to be kind.  And it's all because of our friendship, Hudson.  - You really mean that? - You bet I do.  And I always tell it like it is,  like when I used to write tombstones.  Complained a lot is what she did.  Stewie, what are you doing?  Having a funeral, Bri.  Say good-bye to Evil Stewie.  CHRIS: Did we get a pool?  Is this a pool?  Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  Stewie, slow down, slow down. What happened?  We went to the zoo. We saw an ape.  At first we didn't think we'd see him  'cause he was, like, hiding back in his house.  But then he came out. We saw him!  We saw the ape! He was big.  And then and then and then  And then and then and then  Okay, I get it. You had fun.  Wait, you're not mad I went without you, are you?  No, no, I-I was only going for you.  And maybe to taunt the animals that aren't able to leave.  Which is all of them.  Losers.  All right, you have to take us to lunch,  but first we need to take our nap.  Here's your triple bacon burger and your onion rings.  Ah, crap.  There's only nine pieces of bacon.  I paid for 12.  But I don't wanna make a fuss.  TONY (THROUGH CAR): Peter, listen to yourself.  No one will respect you until you respect yourself first.  Yeah. But I'm a nobody.  You're not a nobody.  Your meal is just as important as anyone else.  You're right.  I'm not a nobody.  TONY: Say it again.  I'm not a nobody!  TONY: That's the spirit, Peter.  Now yell at that nobody in the window.  You there! I demand more bacon.  Oh, I'm sorry. Here's more bacon.  That's not more bacon  This is more bacon!  Big day, Mr. Hogan.  PAUL HOGAN: Keeping coming, Jumpy!  Here's your Star Wars kids' meal.  Which action figures did we get?  I got Kylo Ren.  I got the role during the two months I was a hot actor,  and now they're stuck with me.  I got Forest Whitaker.  Even as a toy you can't tell where he's looking.  I wish I had the poorly-cast Kylo Ren.  Here, Stewie. You can have mine.  You're giving me the better one?  Why would you do that?  Because you're my friend.  Yes.  You're my friend.  You're my best friend.  Let's choke on these together.  (BOTH GAGGING, CHOKING)  (BOTH PANTING)  That was fun.  Let's switch.  (BOTH GAGGING, CHOKING)  Okay, guys. Time to play ""parachute.""  Grab an end  and lift.  You know who loves ""parachute""?  My best friend, Hudson.  - You know Hudson? - I know Hudson, too.  Are you going to his birthday party tomorrow?  I'm autistic.  TEACHER: And lift.  Birthday party?  Yeah, it's at the Family Fun Zone.  Everyone was invited.  I take up a great deal of the teacher's time.  - Where's the mail? - On the table.  What's going on? You seem upset.  Oh, you're a you're a real student  of the human condition, aren't you?  Yet, somehow, it escapes your writing.  Whoa! Why are you attacking me?  (SIGHS) I'm sorry, Brian.  Everyone but me got an invite to Hudson's birthday.  I know why this happened.  I called him my best friend too quickly.  Well, maybe it wasn't meant to be.  But, hey, I'm-I'm still your friend.  (AS CLINT EASTWOOD): Yeah, but Hudson isn't.  And that's just something I have to live with.    (THUNDER RUMBLES)  Stewie, it's 2:00 a.m.  Revenge doesn't sleep.  Come on. Come back to bed.  No.  There's something I gotta do.  Go get 'em, tiger.  Hey.  Shut your (BLEEP) mouth.  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  Victory shall be mine.  (THUNDER RUMBLES)  Ha. That's what the baby used to say  when I was your age.  Shut up, Dad. I'm watching Rick and Morty.  So does Mommy have friends over sometimes at night?  Sometimes.  It must be weird having only women come over to see Mommy.  No, it's mostly men.  Oh, it is.  And you'd be comfortable telling that to a judge?  Good morning, family.  My, who's this go-getter?  Tony Robbins has helped me become a better person.  In fact, today, I'm gonna ask for nay, demand a raise.  ""Nay""? Wow.  This new you is a bigger surprise  than when they're making fun of a celebrity  on Saturday Night Live  and the real-life celebrity walks in behind them.  (CHUCKLES) Boy, they're really socking it to this celebrity.  (CHUCKLES) Yeah, can you imagine how mad the celebrity would be?  I mean, wherever they are at this particular moment,  if they're watching, they must be  (BOTH GASP)  Oh. (LAUGHS)  That's the actual celebrity  walking up right behind 'em.  He-he's catching 'em right in the act.  The-The SNL actor doesn't know.  Aw, he's gonna get in trouble.  Look how mad the actual celebrity is.  He's folding his arms and frowning.  He tapped the SNL actor on the shoulder.  Look how surprised the SNL actor is!  Oh! He's completely busted!  (SCREAMS AND LAUGHS) How is this happening?!  (BOTH SCREAMING)  Oh, my God!  I can't believe it!  I was watching upstairs on Hulu!  I saw it on my phone!  My plane has Wi-Fi!  Stewie? Stewie?  ""Quahog Family Fun Zone""?  (DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING)  Uh-oh.  Stewie's dug up all his weapons.  Oh, my God, I've got to stop him.  Go get 'em, tiger.  Hey.  Shut your (BLEEP) mouth.  Tony! You're not gonna believe it.  I demanded a raise just like you told me to  and they gave it to me.  Tony?  Tony? You in there?  TONY: Guess who, Peter.  Geena Davis?  No, it's me, Peter. Turn around.  Tony? You're alive?  But how?  I saw you get struck by lightning.  I was created by lightning, Peter,  in a lab, like Frankenstein.  And what do you think about fire?  (ROARS)  Anyway, after the lightning strike,  I climbed into your trunk  and that's where I've been living the past week.  So, whenever I heard your voice, that was just you in the trunk?  That's right.  Why would you go to all that trouble?  Peter, I told you,  I wasn't going to let you be my first failure.  Wow, Tony, I don't know how I can possibly thank you.  You don't need to thank me, Peter.  I have hundreds of millions of dollars.  I keep it in my forehead.  Well, I better be going.  You have a Smart car?  I have two.  I'm coming, broken people!  (HAPPY MUSIC PLAYING, INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER)  ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.): Hey, everybody,  we want to give a special shout-out  to little Hudson on his birthday.  (CHEERING)  (BEEPING)  (STEWIE GRUNTS)  (BEEPING GROWS FASTER)  - (EXPLOSION) - (CHILDREN SCREAMING)  Oh, no. Soda!  Sticky balls!    (CHILDREN SCREAMING)  (LAUGHING, THEN SCREAMING)  Damn you all.  (SCREAMING)    Stewie?  That's my name, don't wear it out.  Yeah, let that wash over you.  Learned that from a third grader.  Any last words?  Yeah.  I'm glad to see you.  You never RSVP to the invite my mom sent.  You You invited me?  BRIAN: Yes. He did.  Brian? What are you doing here?  And how do you know I was invited?  Because  I threw your invitation away.  You what?  I know. I'm sorry.  I-I just I saw how you were connecting with Hudson  and I-I was afraid of losing our friendship.  Friendship?  Brian, you and I have never been friends.  We We haven't?  No. Friends are people  who come in and out of our lives.  But you and I are family.  That's forever.  Sorry I caused all this trouble.  I hope you can forgive me.  Ah, that's okay, nothing could ever come between us.  I'm even going to make a speech at your wedding.  So Brian and I are down in Mexico,  and, as usual, he doesn't have any cash on him.  That's probably why your parents  are paying for all this, right, Evan?  BRIAN: Wait, hold on. Evan?  Why am I gay in this?  STEWIE: Ah, it's the end of the show.  We sometimes do something silly here.  So, now that you got me back as a friend,  what are all the great things you have planned for us?  Uh we could go see a movie.  Oh, a movie. That's a great idea.  You know what'll get me out of this funk?  The Equalizer 2.  (CHUCKLING) Okay. All right, fine.  I got I got nothing.  Exactly.  And you were such a jealous little bitch  that you had to ruin the one friendship I really cared about.  You're just a big jerk and I hate you,  and there's nothing you can do to make up for it.  Fine.  Maybe I'll just go out and get some ice cream.  Ice cream?  I like ice cream.  Yeah, I don't know. I think it's more of a bigger kid thing.  No, no, no! No. I've had ice cream, like, six times.  All right, come on, let's go.  You know, Brian, I'm starting to think  we're going to get through our Rocky Road.  (BOTH CHUCKLE)  (FORCED LAUGH)  We had a lot of laughs tonight,  but let's remember the important thing:  you can't put a price on your happiness,  which is why I have: it's $6,000.  See you in Fort Myers, probably."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    (BARKING)  - Whoa, whoa, easy, boy, easy. - (GROWLING)  I-It's just Stewie in a kitty costume.  I'm a calico, and my name is Humphrey.  He got his face painted at a birthday party.  It was the only thing this little guy could do.  He was too light for the caterpillar slide,  too short for the piÃ±ata,  and too scared to touch the animals in the petting zoo.  - Half of them had erections. - Half of them had erections.  The pony was magnificent.  The pony was magnificent.  - Oh, what do we have here? - Hey, back off!  That's my goodie bag.  Ugh. An eraser.  Raisins in an unsealed sandwich bag.  Oh, a parachute guy.  Uhp, he's already tangled.  This day started off so great.  It was awash in cake and pony boners.  Now all I have is this dumb whistle.  - (EXHALES) - Doesn't even work.  (EXHALES)  Ow! What the hell?!  Oh, it's a dog whistle.  - (EXHALES) - (SHOUTS)  I've always wondered what that sounds like to you.  (INHALES)  GILBERT GOTTFRIED: Dog whistle! Dog whistle!  Where are you, dog?!  - Give me that! - Hey.  Oh, what, you want it? Here, take it.  Give it back.  - Give me it. - No. It's mine now.  In fact, I'm gonna put it where you can never reach it.  No!  - Good luck, shrimp. - (GRUNTING)  I can't believe the nerve of that dog.  Teaching me a lesson about size?  I'm not even that small.  Tiny Tom Cruise?  Oh, hey, little guy. Forgot my sunglasses.  Hey, what's with your gay character names lately?  Stacee Jaxx? Jack Reacher?  I mean, who are you playing next?  (CHUCKLES): All right, try to make this sound gay:  next up, I play Headmaster Bates Mann.  - Anything else? - Actually, yes.  After that, I'll be taking the role of Major Dixon Butts,  then Senator Rod Clutcher.  (AUDIENCE APPLAUSE)  (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)  I'm too small, am I, Brian?  Well, we'll just see who's the bigger man.  ""Brian, sorry I got testy. Let's bury the hatchet.  ""If you're free, I'd love to hear about  any new writing projects you're working""  - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Oh, at least wait for me to send it.  - (TEXT MESSAGE CHIRPS) - (COMPUTER CHIMES)  Hey, Stewie, I got your text. What am I working on?  (CHUCKLES): What am I not working on?  Well, first off, I got this screenplay for Tom Cruise,  about the queen's private secretary, Sir Gaylord Hummer.  Well, actually, he might do that.  But, Brian, I'm more interested in short stories.  (WHIRRING)  (SHOUTS, VOICE PITCH INCREASES)  (FOOTSTEPS RUMBLING)  (ECHOING): Well, hello there, little guy.  (HIGH-PITCHED): What the hell did you do to me, Stewie?  Well, Brian, you seemed to enjoy belittling me,  so I decided to belittle you.  I've simply shrunken down your molecular structure.  It was easy, really.  Like taking candy, or a whistle, from a baby.  You dick. Undo this.  This is perfect.  I think my excitement is best expressed  by Jean-Claude Van Damme in this scene.  (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)  All right, you've made your point. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I couldn't hear that, it's too high-pitched.  - You're what? - I'm sorry.  - For what? - For calling you a shrimp.  - And? - What do you mean ""and""?  Come on, you know what I want.  And all four chairs  would totally turn for you on The Voice.  - Anything else? - (SIGHS)  And the way you salute and point is very casual  and free of affectation.  Hey, thanks, Bri. I'll go switch you back.  (RAPID FOOTSTEPS)  (SNIFFS)  - (GROWLS) - Stewie!  You know, I'm really flattered you think  all four Voice chairs would turn around.  My dream order would be Adam, Blake,  Alicia Keys, and then Kelly Clarkson,  whose chair I imagine would turn last,  'cause she's, uh she's a bigger gal.  Help!  Oh, crap.  Don't worry, Brian, I'll save you!  But I'm a millennial, so first I have to watch  a YouTube instructional video on how to do it.  What's going on, guys?  I'm Corey, and today I'm gonna teach you  how to get your friend out of a rat hole.  Now, before we get started, don't forget to subscribe  to my channel, Corey's World.  And, guys, I'll get to as many comments as I can,  but I can't get to all of them.  And don't forget to check out my other videos,  like ""How to Play Guitar.""  Uh, Brian, this might be a while.  What's going on, guys? I'm Corey.  Brian! Hang in there, buddy.  BRIAN (HIGH-PITCHED): Hurry up! Get this rat away from me!  I'll shrink myself down and come get you.  But in the meantime, they say  if you put your finger in a rat's butt, that disables it.  (RAT SCREECHES)  BRIAN: It didn't work. Now he's just angry.  Try wetting your finger first.  - (RAT SCREECHES) - BRIAN: Just get in here!  (WHIRRING)  (RAT GROWLING)  Hey, come on, guy. (CHUCKLES) Hey, you don't want to do this.  I'll have what she's having.  (SQUISHES)  Please tell me that's not the finger  you stuck in a rat's butt.  No. It I don't-I don't remember which one it was.  Yeah, that was the finger.  All right, let's get back to the machine.  Look at all this shag carpet.  This is like our Vietnam movie.  (SOUTHERN ACCENT): I miss Jenny.  - What is that? - That's Forrest. Forrest Gump.  - Yeah, I-I don't think so. - Shh.  - (DISTANT MECHANICAL HUMMING) - What is that?  It ain't a box of chocolates.  (WHIRRING)  (NORMAL VOICE): Vacuum cleaner!  (BOTH SCREAMING)  I hate my life and nobody can hear me say it right now!  (BOTH SCREAMING)  (WHIRRING STOPS)  Oh, my God, this is disgusting!  I just hope she's done vacuuming.  - (VACUUM SQUEAKING) - LOIS: Okay, everyone,  dump your toenails in the hall, I'm vacuuming.  - (VACUUM WHIRRING) - Oh, God.  That was close.  (BOTH SCREAMING)  Oh, my God, we're in the trash outside!  We've got to get down from here. Quick, pass me that baggie.  How am I supposed to get down? That was the only baggie.  Use either the tampon strings  or the discarded dental floss and rappel down.  - (BONES CRACK) - Which one did you go with?  Neither. I was hoping to kill myself.  (WHISTLING)  Two days of mail at once, nobody knows.  Don't go over two. Don't get greedy.  Uhp, got a bat in the cave.  All right, I figure if we can just  What's going on? An eclipse?  - Ah! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Holy crap! What is that?!  - Gross! Oh! - What is on us? Oh!  Ah! Snot rocket!  Oh, my God, it's so disgusting!  Get it off! Get it off!  - Are you guys eating that? - Uh, what?  Are you eating this pile of boogers?  - Uh, no. - Can I eat it?  Yeah, please. We're stuck.  Dude, dude, you got to get down here, by the big trash can.  Dude, dude, dude, just get here.  (BEE BUZZING)  - Brian, we've got to get up to my room. - Yeah, but how?  We'll just climb the lattice on the front of the house.  - When did we get that? - Well, every '80s movie had one,  so the fat man thought we should have one, too.  Wow. Okay, great.  You know, it's funny, you said ""every '80s movie,""  but I can't think of a single one.  - Ferris Bueller's Day Off? - I don't think so.  But the lattice thing sounded right when you said it.  I-I feel like '80s movies were wall-to-wall lattices.  - Sixteen Candles? - Hmm no, no.  I mean, she was being ignored most of the movie.  Who'd be climbing into her window?  Ah, good point. Risky Business?  No. Hookers don't climb.  Oh, I know, Home Alone.  Home Alone must've had a lattice.  Maybe, but that was 1990.  Eh, it feels like an '80s movie.  You know, it was probably greenlit in the '80s,  when lattices were still a thing.  Oh, wow, here we are.  All right, Brian, at this size, this is a two-man job.  While I adjust the settings, you go over there  and hit the tiny button to fire it up.  (WHIRRING)  Wait a minute.  This doesn't feel right. What button did you hit?  That one. The tiny button.  STEWIE: Wait, did you hit the tiny button  or the button that says ""tiny""?  I hit the button that says ""tiny.""  - You said, ""Hit the tiny button."" - Exactly!  I didn't say, ""Hit the big button that says 'tiny, '""  I said, ""hit the tiny button.""  The one you pressed is going to shrink us down  to microscopic size!  Well, why would you make the tiny button big?  I had to make it big enough to write ""tiny"" on it!  BRIAN: Well, what the hell do we do now?!  STEWIE: I don't  I-I'm still thinking about that lattice thing.  I want to say Parenthood?  BRIAN: Parenthood. Yes. I feel like Parenthood is right.  (CREATURES CHIRPING)  It's beautiful.  Ah, I just wish my hot girlfriend were here to see it.  Oh, yeah? Yeah, you have a girlfriend?  - What's her name? - Girly Friendston.  ""Girly Friendston""? Nice try, Stewie.  Why won't he answer my texts?  WOMAN: Girly, your piano teacher's here.  - Oh, Mom, do I have to? - Girly Friendston,  you stop mooning over that boyfriend of yours  - and get down here this instant. - (SIGHS)  (KNOCK ON DOOR)  Hi. I'm the exterminator.  An ex-Terminator? So you used to be a Terminator?  - No. I kill rats and bugs. - And Sarah Connor.  - No, Peter. We have a rat. - My stuff's in my truck.  - I'll be back. - (GASPS)  See that, Lois?  There's more Terminators around than you think there are.  (BEEPING)  I hope he can terminate  some of the bad attitudes on our kids, huh?  (LAUGHS WEAKLY) Yeah.  - (RUMBLING) - What's that sound?  Oh, my God! Look!  (CREATURES SCREECHING)  (ROARING)  (SCREECHES)  Holy crap, what the hell were those things?!  Dust mites.  One of the most dominant species of the micro world.  Why did they just attack like that?  MALE VOICE: Because they're jerks.  Aah! Who the hell are you?  Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you, little buddies.  My name's Vernon. I'm a water bear.  A water bear? What's a water bear?  They're predominantly water-dwelling, eight-legged  segmented micro animals.  They're also known as a moss piglet or a tardigrade.  You can call me tardy, but I'm always on time.  Ha-ha. Yeah.    Well, here she is. Home sweet home.  Everybody, we've got guests!  You'll see that we have quite the diverse cast of characters.  (SOUTHERN ACCENT): I'm the country water bear.  ""Yee-haw"" is what I say.  Flagellum? I don't even know them.  I'm the black one.  And I'm Patrick Stewart as a water bear.  I can't believe there's this whole universe  hidden here in your rug where everyone speaks English.  Okay, Brian, take the ride.  Here, have a sip of water.  (ALL GASP)  What the? Hey, cut it out!  You have water? Water is life.  Yeah, we need water bad.  And I'm the gay one, but I'm not, like, doing the gay voice.  Listen, Stewie and I come from a place  where water flows like well, water.  That's right. And we need to get back there.  And if you guys help us,  we'll make sure you never want for water again.  What do you say?  - (CHEERING) - All right!  Patrick Stewart!  - Well, what'd you find? - I'll be honest.  I think this is a conversation best had over dinner.  Oh. Okay.  So what's going on with the house?  I don't like talking business at the table.  - Let's just enjoy our wine. - You're right. I'm sorry.  (QUIETLY): Your wife's asleep.  Sometimes she fakes it so I can't hump her,  but this seems legit.  So, uh, shouldn't we talk about what you found at our house?  I don't know. It's so late. I have a crazy idea.  Should we talk about it over a nightcap?  Uh, sure, I guess.  I'm a little chilly.  Oh, well, I-I guess I don't need this.  Sir? Sir, I asked you what you found out about the house.  What? Oh. You're gonna have to tent the house.  All right. Thanks for your work. You're very professional.  Yeah, that's me. Professional.  Always professional.  And alone.  (LADYSMITH BLACK MAMBAZO STYLE SONG PLAYING)    What the hell is this giant wall?  We're here, Brian. That's your laptop.  If we get inside, I can remotely hack into the shrink ray.  (RUMBLING)  Oh, my God! It's the dust mites!  (SCREECHING)  Oh, no! Water Bear Consuela, can you stop them?  No, no. I only clean Wednesday.  - Can't you just clean today? - No, no. Wednesday.  (DUST MITES SCREECHING)  Here's the micro board.  I just need to reroute the circuits.  All right. The laptop is now linked to the shrink ray.  The only problem is that I can't activate it from here.  We still somehow have to press  the return button on the keyboard.  But at this size, there's no way I can do it alone.  Wait. I've got an idea.  Well, you better act quickly.  Guys! Follow me up this way!  Why is there a tiny lattice inside this computer?  I guess Steve Jobs was really into '80s movies.  (DUST MITES SCREECHING)  Brian, wait for my signal.  Hold.  - Hold. - (HISSES)  Hold.  - Now! - You-you never told me what to do.  - Jump! - Why?  - Trust me. - Aah!  (ALL SCREAMING)  (BUTTON CLICKS)  My God! It worked!  Stewie, you're a genius!  - (SCREECHING) - Oh, no.  Run!  Okay. All the gas bombs are set up.  Time to blow all those vermin to kingdom come.  Can I press the button?  Hmm, perhaps that's a question best pondered over dinner?  You-you can just press it. Go ahead.  (BEEPS)  Aah! Poison gas!  They must've gotten an exterminator for the rat!  (ROARING)  Tiny Tom Cruise?  (BOTH GRUNT)  (BOTH COUGHING)  Thank you, Tiny Tom Cruise. How can we ever repay you?  Well, you could make a sizable donation  to the Church of Spaceship Beep Boop.  You mean the Church of  Yeah, kidnapping, torture, extortion, that's the one.  And we won't get in trouble  because we didn't use the actual name.  MAN: What did he just say?  We are about love and spaceships and beep boop!  Get my lawyer on the phone!  - You have children in there?! - Oh, yeah, three.  Should-should we have mentioned that?  MAN: Meg, Chris, come to the light.  Meg, no. Don't do it.  Don't go to Prince!  Come to the purple light, Meg.  Come taste infinity.  Don't listen to him, Meg.  But he's so talented and he's got so many drugs.  Alan Thicke is here, too.  Hey, guys. Come on in. It's a hoot.  I'm coming, Alan Thicke.  No!  Google my CrystaLight aerobics competition.  It's ridiculous.  I hope Vernon and the gang survived.  That gas was pretty powerful.  Well, let's take a look.  They're okay. Let's deliver on our promise.  A little water for our little friends.  - Oh, hell no! - Set country music!  Oh, my gay God.  (SCREAMING)  Ah, they're dead. Now I'm sad.  Cheer me up, Jean-Claude Van Damme.  I haven't gone   Feeling   So good today   Ain't nobody"

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Happy birthday, Lois.  You know, today you officially become  the oldest woman I've ever slept with.  Yes. You said the same thing last year.  Well, unlike you, that joke never gets old.  Oh, and I forgot to pick up the cake.  Hey, Lois, I don't like any of these snacks.  Can I have something from the kitchen?  We can have snacks from the kitchen?  I could go for a sandwich.  No. No one gets snacks from the kitchen.  You see what you started?  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Hi. I'm here for the pony rides.  - What? - Oh, boy.  This-this must be some sort of big mix-up.  Don't worry, Lois, I'll handle this.  - What's his name? - Lightning.  (LAUGHS) That means he's fast.  So, uh, Lois, where are your parents?  Didn't they say they were coming?  Yeah, but I'm sure Daddy had a last-minute work thing.  He's always put business first.  Even growing up, he never came to any of my piano recitals.  It was the '80s, so he was always doing  cocaine-and-sushi business meetings.  All right, Hideki, it's a deal.  Now, let's celebrate the way rich guys do, by  (INHALES DEEPLY)  Ah, damn it, I snorted the wrong one.  Ah, wasabi!  Wasabi in my nostril!  (GROANS)  Still better than sitting through that piano thing.  (KNOCKING ON DOOR)  Oh, hi, Daddy. You missed the party.  I know. I thought I'd apologize  with an upper-class New England mumble-kiss.  (BOTH SMOOCHING)  - I'm so sorry, dear. - It's okay.  And here, I brought you a gift.  - A gun? - Yeah, you love guns.  No, I don't.  You don't know me at all.  I can't believe you'd blow off my party  then give me a handgun.  Especially when there's kids in the house.  Hall. Kids in the Hall.  Damn it, Daddy.  I'm trying to explain that guns are hazardous and unsafe,  not have a conversation about  a tepid 1990s Canadian sketch group.  You're wrong about guns and comedy.  I'm out of here.  Buh-bye.  Was that a tepid 1990s David Spade reference?  People are allowed to like things!  Peter, you want to watch Netflix?  Yeah, let's watch one of those stand-up specials.  There's a bunch of 'em, they got to be good.  No. No.  Tom Segura? No.  Chinese girl.  Another Chinese girl.  No. No.  Anjelah Johnson?  Geez, they're giving one of these to everyone.  - How come I don't have one? - You do, Peter.  This is the taped intro.  Mr. Griffin, you're on.  -  - (APPLAUSE)  Good evening, Ithaca Civic Auditorium.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  So I'm thinking I might get a bike.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  You know, one of these things?  Ring-ring, ring-ring.  ""I'll get you, Toto!"" (CHUCKLES) Yeah.  I'm thinking I might.  (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)  Okay, I'm off to the grocery store.  - So, what'd you do with the gun? - Gun?  Yeah, my father gave me a gun as a present yesterday.  Where was that during birthday sex?  Maybe I would have finished.  Unlike you, guns can actually fire.  I don't think this marriage needs a gun.  Anyway, I hid the gun someplace safe  until I can figure out how to properly dispose of it.  So don't get any ideas.  Good for Lois.  Guns are a major problem,  especially in the hands of someone like  (GUNSHOT, GLASS BREAKING)  It was in a box with Chris's adoption papers Oh.  You heard nothing.  Hi, I got my gun here.  I'd like to rent a stall, please.  Sure. You need a tutorial before you start?  (CHUCKLES) Yeah, it's a gun range.  I think I got it.  Wait! I think I did it wrong.  So how was the gun range, Dad?  Did you shoot up that silhouette real good?  (LAUGHS) That is so my dad.    Now here to sing the Heart classic ""Alone""  is Chris Griffin.    I hear the ticking of the clock   I'm lying here   The room's pitch dark     I wonder where you are tonight   No answer on the telephone.   PETER: Turn around.  ANNOUNCER: We now return to The Orville on Fox.  Why do you hate that show so much?  (DIFFERENT VOICE): Because it's preventing me  from doing my work here at Family Guy.  Damn it, I think I loaded a bullet wrong.  All right, let's all take turns looking down the barrel  with one eyeball and see if we can figure out what's going on.  Chris, you go first.  Oh, my God, Peter. Give me that.  This gun is not staying in this house for one more second.  I'm giving it back to my father.  Yeah, it's been a disaster.  Like when Peter was the only one not wearing black jeans  at a Rush concert.  (CHEERING)  Sing ""Tom Sawyer""!  We already did.  And what are you wearing?!  What? These are my concert khakis.  Beat him! Beat him in six-eight time.  And don't let him escape  to the completely unoccupied ladies' room.  Ah! No. Please,  uncles who voted for Gary Johnson, leave me alone.  (WHIMPERING)  And now a song about radio towers.  Daddy?  Daddy, are you there?  (WHISPERING): Don't do anything to scare him.  He flew on my shoulder while I was having a lemonade.  - Daddy, I - (SQUAWKING)  What?  Daddy, you need to take this gun back.  I never should have accepted it in the first place.  And you never should have given it to me.  Are you sure?  I bought it at Anthropologie.  Oh.  Wait a minute, what am I saying?  No. You have to take it back.  I'm not. You're keeping it. It's a gift.  Damn it, Daddy, why won't you just take the gun?  Oh, my God! Daddy!  I'm so sorry.  (GASPS) It can't be too serious.  They haven't done an overhead crane shot yet.  Oh, God! There it is!  - I'm calling 911. - (LINE RINGS)  Oh, no. It's floating up,  signifying his spirit leaving his body.  (SINGLE MINOR KEY NOTE PLAYS)  And there's the single minor key note.  This is bad.  Family Guy will be right (SQUAWKS): back.  Well, now it doesn't seem so serious.  Hey, quick question: any of you guys know how  to countersue somebody?  Dr. Hartman, please, how's my father?  Well, at this point, it's hard to say.  He suffered severe head trauma.  So if you want to beat him in Mario Kart,  this is your chance.  (VIDEO GAME SOUNDS ON TV)  And the champ is dethroned.  Oh, poor Daddy. You know what?  We're gonna bring him home with us  and take care of him until he's 100%.  What? Oh, come on, Mom.  I want Grandpa to get better, too, but living with us?  Why can't Grandma take care of him?  Oh, she's busy.  She went to Antarctica to steal a penguin.  Penguin?  Daddy's gonna require all our love and support.  Well, you got the right guy for that.  I'm great at supporting people.  On Mad Men, I was Christina Hendricks' bra.  Joan, can you call a meeting of the partners?  PETER (MUFFLED): Help me.  Too much is being asked of me.  CHRIS (MUFFLED): At least you're there.  I'm Jon Hamm's underwear.  STEWIE (MUFFLED): Why am I Elisabeth Moss's socks?  Chris and I should switch.  - CHRIS: Yeah, let's switch. - STEWIE: We're gonna switch.  All right, Chris, give me a hand with Carter.  JOE: Hey, I heard another chair.  Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!  He's not paralyzed, Joe, he's just recovering.  Ah.  All right, Daddy living here is gonna be a big adjustment,  and we're all gonna have to make sacrifices.  So, Meg, Daddy will sleep in your room,  and Stewie and Chris, you'll stay where you are.  What? I'm the only one sacrificing.  Don't be ridiculous, Meg. I said everybody's names.  Come on, Meg, it won't be any worse than when I took  GÃ©rard Depardieu to Burning Man.  I feel so free.  My breasts are muddied up.  I'm tripping balls.  Easy, GÃ©rard, we're still at Enterprise Rent-A-Car.  I'm gonna go crazy.  You can poop anywhere.  We'll take the insurance.  All right, Carter, now we're gonna try and jog your memory  and get you talking with some familiar pictures.  So, I will hold them up and you say what they are.  What? You don't know who this is?  But he's so talented.  Anyone who doesn't know who he is  brings shame on his children and wife.  Peter, come on. We're trying to help Daddy,  not relive our embarrassing loss to Joe and Bonnie in Celebrity.  All right, fine. Next picture.  What? You don't know who he is, either?  Go on, Lois, scream at him that he should know.  This guy was in a movie once.  That means we need to put a fifth head on Mount Rushmore.  Damn it, Peter, you should've known who he is.  Even Joe knew.  Yep, Joe sure did.  Hey, Ansel Elgort and Gemma Arterton  are in a Cary Fukunaga film.  Good for them.  All right, Daddy, I know NCIS is on,  but I want to watch Real Housewives,  unless you tell me not to.  (GRUNTING)  Oh, those two hate each other.  These two have a three-year-old feud  based on an offhanded remark at a charity fashion show.  (GRUNTING)  I'm sure Andy Cohen will explain it all  on Watch What Happens Live after the show.  No! The show itself is bad enough!  We don't need another show explaining what we just saw.  Daddy! You're back.  Please, anything but this show.  We could watch Netflix.  Uh, Cleveland Brown:  You Startin' To See What I'm Sayin'?  So, the president pulls the plug  on an investigation into the president?  You startin' to see what I'm sayin'?  (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)  Since you're doing a little better, Daddy,  I thought you should see where you work.  It might help trigger more memories about your life.  I work here? Wow. This place is huge.  What do we do? Are we nice?  You put pesticides in baby food.  - Aw. - Not only that, your chemical waste  - gave a town cancer. - Yikes.  You burned down the entire Amazon rain forest.  - Whoops - You're the number-one producer  - of whale meat. - Sheesh.  - You dumped lead in drinking water. - Zoinks.  Your oil pipeline moved 12 Native American tribes.  - (WHISTLES) - Your fertilizer plant exploded,  - killing 4,000. - (INHALES SHARPLY)  - You bought Vine and shut it down. - I did what?  - You bought Vine and shut it down. - I did what?  - You bought Vine and shut it down. - I did what?  I'm sorry, Daddy, but you're a very cutthroat businessman.  And maybe worst of all,  you engage in constant, gratuitous animal testing.  Sir, as you requested, we had all the monkeys watch Vikings.  Did they like it? Do they think it's worth  - me putting in the time? - Uh, no.  - They didn't care for it. - Good.  This is valuable information.  Now have them watch Sarah Jessica Parker  and Thomas Haden Church in Divorce.  Sir, they've just watched 66 consecutive hours of Vikings.  - If you could - Oh, what, so you want humans  to watch Divorce?  Because if monkeys don't, that's what has to happen.  Wow, I guess I was a cutthroat businessman.  But what about when I wasn't at work?  What did we do together?  Well, sometimes you made me reenact  Kids in the Hall sketches that basically had no endings.  - (MUSICAL STING PLAYS) - (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  But to be honest, we didn't do much.  - Your work always came first. - Really?  And you still took care of me when I was hurt?  I I don't like who I was.  But from now on, I'm going to be a better father and grandfather.  We're going to spend real time together.  Really? Oh, that'd be wonderful.  I haven't been this happy since I went on Safari.  Oh, my God. This is so much faster than Firefox.  (CHUCKLES) All right, let me go to Facebook.  F-A (SIGHS)  It's auto filling ""Fat Butt Rodeo""?  Peter!  You were supposed to stay on Firefox.  Morning, pumpkin. I brought muffins.  You brought pumpkin muffins?  - What? No. Wh-What? - But you said  You know what? Let's try it one more time.  Hey, sweetie pie. I brought muffins.  - You brought sweet pies and muffins? - No.  - (MUSICAL STING PLAYS) - (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  We've already done that.  Damn it, now it's gonna go back outside.  Wow, Daddy, you really meant what you said.  It's been wonderful spending so much quality time with you.  Yeah, Carter. You know, you've always been a real bastard,  but I got to say, it's nice to see you turning things around.  Thanks. You know, you guys made me realize  that I wasted my whole life caring about money,  and I'm not giving up another second.  That's why I've decided  to retire from Pewterschmidt Industries  and give all my money to charity.  Oh, Daddy, that's wonderful.  Yeah, Carter. Good for you.  Thanks. You know, I was a little worried  you guys would be mad about losing your inheritance.  Oh, Daddy, I don't care.  I've seen what wealth's done to you,  and I certainly don't want that to happen to us.  Besides, we're regular people.  We wouldn't miss millions of dollars, right, Peter?  I'm thinking I might.  So, it's weird being Japanese.  Last night, my husband wanted 69.  I said, ""Why do you want beef and broccoli now?""  Hey, that's Chinese.  Look, I know you're upset about losing our inheritance,  but when we got married, the first thing I told you  is I didn't want Daddy's money.  Well, yeah, not now,  but I didn't know you meant forever.  Peter, stop being so selfish.  For the first time in my life, I have a father who's kind  and wants to spend time with me.  And that's more important than any inheritance.  Yeah, well, I still want that money.  It's the only way I can afford that surgery  to turn myself into 100% stained glass.  - I don't get it. - Neither do I.  Oh, my God.  Dad's beautiful.  All right, guys. Now, the way I see it,  Carter's only giving away his money 'cause he's nice now.  So to get our inheritance,  we have to figure out a way to make him mean again.  I don't know, Dad. He seems pretty happy.  Anyone can get mad, Chris. Even Shaquille O'Neal.  Excuse me.  My flapjacks was supposed to have a Superman ""S"" on them.  Are you mad? I I can't tell if you're mad.  Very mad. This is unacceptable.  At's the point of having millions of dollars  if everything can't be Superman?  Okay, well, we'll fix it right away.  Is there anything else I can get you?  Yes. A big ambulance.  I am stuck in this booth.  So, ideas how do we make Carter mean again?  Why don't we hire a prostitute  to bring him almost to completion?  Okay, don't love that my daughter came out of the gates with that.  Why don't we just mix up all the colors of his Play-Doh?  Chris.  Well, you know what gets Gargamel all riled up  is those pesky Smurfs. Maybe there's something there.  Ooh, I know, I know.  Why don't we hire a transvestite to pick him up at a bar,  then take off her wig  at the exact moment of completion?  Yeah, Meg, take it down a notch.  I know what'll make him mad.  Let's get him a book for Christmas.  Didn't I get you all books for Christmas?  Yeah. And now I've got something for you to read, genius.  It's called the room.  Hey, wait, I got something. How do we summon Zuul?  I bet Zuul could help.  Why don't we take him to a truck stop bathroom,  and then after completion, we  Okay, Meg, are you trying to get a rise out of me?  'Cause guess what, young lady?  It worked.  Well, at least I'm saying real ideas  and not just repeating things  I've seen in children's programming.  Yeah, Dad, I kind of agree with Meg.  It seems like you're going for comedy over substance.  I see. Well, then,  I have one last idea how to make Carter mean.  (VOICE BREAKING): Turn him into one of my kids.  (SOBBING)  So, what do you want to do today?  You know, this may be crazy,  but I'd love to finally play piano for you.  Cool, like Alicia Keys.  A piano player named Keys?  - That has to be fake, right? - Yeah, I'd think so.  That's pretty dumb. I mean, if I was in a band,  I wouldn't call myself Carter Guitar.  I know, right?  Actually, I like Carter Guitar.  - I want to be that now. - Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't we do something together?  I'll play, and you sing.  Sounds great. Who's the guy who married a kid  and then later on killed his wife?  - Jerry Lee Lewis. - That's it.  You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain   Something, some-something, something, something insane   Goodness gracious, great balls of fire   (CARTER VOCALIZING)  Y-You don't have to sing the piano part.  I'm playing it.  All right, here's the plan.  I clothespin his balls.  Meg and Chris, you twist his nipples in opposite directions.  I'm glad you came around.  Peter, you may want to take a look at this.  You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain   Oh, my God. Look at them.  This is just what she's been saying she wanted:  to spend time with her dad and for him to love her.  I guess that really is more important than money.  Wow. Dad's really taking this to heart.  Meg. Meg.  Tie my shoe.  Hey, let's do another. How about my karaoke song?  Sure, what-what is it?  The theme to Hill Street Blues.  What? But that doesn't have any lyrics.  The hell it doesn't.  Hill Street blues, Hill Street blues   Hill Street blues   I've got those Hill Street blues.   Wow, you're good.  Of course I'm good. I'm Carter Guitar.  Hill Street blues, Hill Street blues   Hill Street blues   I've got those Hill Street blues   There were some ugly people on that show.  That's what made it real.  ALL:  Hill Street blues   Hill Street blues, Hill Streeblues   I've got those Hill Street blues.   What are you doing here?  I'm sorry I only cared about the money, Lois.  You were right. You having a dad is way more important.  Thanks, Peter.  Hill Street blues, Hill Street blues   Hill Street blues   - (GUNSHOT) - Oh, my God! Daddy!  Who told Carter he could give away our (BLEEP) money?  Daddy? Daddy, please tell me you can hear me.  Wh-Wha What's going on?  And what are you idiots doing here?  I can't waste time with you. I'm a cutthroat businessman.  Aw, the gunshot changed him back.  Oh, thank God. There's my Carter.  Well, I guess it was nice  to have time with Daddy while I could.  And Peter, I'm glad you filly realized  family is more important than money.  Me too, Lois.  And I think we all learned  a valuable lesson about firearms.  That's right, Peter. Guns create problems,  but they solve them, too.  You said it, Lois. And you know who else has a gun?  Stan Smith. Take it away, Stan.  Peter, that's  that show's not on after us anymore.  Oh. What is on?  Something as or more successful?"

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, thanks for coming in to see me today.  Is this about Chris?  We know he's been struggling lately.  Well, let me put it this way.  (QUICKLY): Parents of a failing student say what?  - What? - No, Peter, wait.  Nope, too late; he said it. I'm marking it.  Didn't get the Woos; they're very smart. Asian.  Maybe they didn't understand me. I don't know.  The point is, Chris's grades aren't improving,  and just yesterday, he caused a little ruckus  in his history class.  (RAPPING):  Alexander Hamilton was white   I just can't understand why he's doing so poorly.  We here feel that the best solution  is for Chris to attend something called vocational school.  Yeah, you know what? Chris deserves a vocation.  He's been working hard, he's doing great in school  No, vocational school is where  less academically capable students learn a trade.  Don't you have to be Italian to go to one of those schools?  Uhp, there will be plenty of those jokes  later in the episode.  Now, won't vocational school  limit Chris's options down the road?  Oh, hardly.  He'll have a wide range of career options,  such as the following:  (PEPPY MUSIC PLAYING)  Those are three terrible options.  (QUICKLY): Parents who are okay with this say what?  - What? - Gotcha.  That one's on you, Lois.  Why, Meg, don't you look pretty today.  Thanks, Mom.  She's going to ask you for something.  So, listen, I was wondering.  Do you think you could take Stewie  to a birthday party today?  The birthday boy was premature,  so he looks like a 12-inch-tall Rachel Dratch.  Why can't you do it, Mom?  (GROANS) I can't take another party  with that trio of judgy sitcom moms.  Oh, hi, Lois.  Gosh, I just love how you always look so comfortable.  I know. Are those pajamas?  And I'm the black one for unrealistic diversity.  I can't believe I have to go to vocational school.  Does this mean I'm a failure?  No, sweetie. It means that we're failures.  You know, I'm always at a loss for words in these moments.  Fred Sanford, you want to do the honors?  Go get 'em, you big dummy.  Um, your show went off the air 40 years ago,  and you died 30 years ago,  so that phrase means very little to me.  I know it's a big step, honey, but you can do it.  That's right, Chris. This family's never shied away  from a new challenge, like when I was the spokesman  for that perfume, Deschanel Number Five.  PETER (WHISPERING): Precious. Annoying.  Twee.  Hot, but not worth it.  Probably a nightmare in person.  Deschanel.  The fragrance for when you want to smell  like a 40-year-old toddler.  Can I help you?  Yes, I'm here for my first day of vocational school.  Right this way.  (""THEN HE KISSED ME"" BY THE CRYSTALS PLAYING)  Well, he walked up to me   And he asked me if I wanted to dance   He looked kind of nice   And so I said I might take a chance   When he danced, he held me tight   And when he walked me home that night   This notepad and pencil is from Mr. Tony over there.  And then he kissed me   All right, settle down, you yucks.  We got a new student, Chris Griffin.  So everybody give him an ""ayy.""  STUDENTS: Ayy.  Look at that, your first day, and you got all A's.  Come here, let me pinch your cheek.  Got all A's.  (LAUGHS) You're expressing affection and dominance.  Griffin? Where's the ""Ucci"" or ""Squalotta"" at the end?  - You Jewish? - No.  It true, if you're Jewish,  they cut your dong off with an ax?  My uncle's Jewish. Friggin' mess, that guy.  Hey, chip-chop, it's 9:30. Let's start thinking lunch.  We do a nice sit-down thing here.  Little piccata, little veal.  Rocco here learned to cook in the joint.  Okay, everybody dirty up your hands, we'll eat in ten.  Wow. This is way better than that barber school I went to  where I couldn't stop pumping the chair.  Just a bit off the top and shorter on the sides.  We're just gonna be pumping today.  (CHILDREN YELLING PLAYFULLY)  Did you bring the cups?!  Um, uh, no.  My mom didn't say anything about cups.  (SCREAMS)  (PHONE CHIMES, VIBRATES)  All right, snack table. Now, what do we got?  Loose Cheerios, Goldfish crackers,  pretzel sticks, and ooh.  The siren's song of the unattended: whole grapes.  Come and eat us   We won't choke you   Put us in your cheeks.   Oh, okay. These grapes seem nice enough.  They said they won't choke me.  (CHOKING)  You should have sliced us   Skinned us, cut us, now you have no air   Ha-ha-ha.   - (CHOKING) - Oh, my God, Stewie!  - You're choking! - (COUGHS)  Soaring through the air.   (PANTING)  Meg. You saved me.  You're you're my hero.  I am not letting you out of my sight again.  Here I lie   On the ground   What of me now?   No bowl, no bunch   No stems   But is here where I begin again?   Today I begin the life that I've dreamed   Uhp, there's a foot.  ANNOUNCER (OVER TV): Coming this fall, from the  makers of Paranormal Activity comes Normal Activity.  (FARTS)  (URINATING)  (FARTING, URINATING)  (TOILET FLUSHES)  (YAWNS) Did you wash your hands?  Yeah.  Meg Griffin, you saved your brother's life,  so here's your showcase of prizes.  You'll be the talk of the town with your new macaroni necklace.  That's right, you'll be strutting down Spooner Street  in this dental floss macaroni necklace  made with Oral-B dental floss and Pasta Barilla.  Pasta Barilla: a taste of Italy right in your home.  All right, time for Bethenny Frankel,  America's favorite chattering pirate skeleton.  MEG (MUFFLED): Dad! Dad, get off me!  Get off me, Dad!  Hey, hey! Get off my sister!  - Go fly a kite, bub. - Ouch.  Wow, that book really worked.  His hat's flying off cause he's been given a what for.  Peter, leave the baby alone.  Why don't you pick on someone your own size,  like William Howard Taft?  (SLIDE WHISTLE)  Wow, you're further in the book than I am.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll just go retrieve my hat.  (SLIDE WHISTLE)  (GASPING)  And, Meg, why are you on the couch?  You know you're not supposed to be on the furniture.  Look at her. She just sits there and takes it.  She deserves a better life than this, Brian.  And you know what? I'm going to give it to her.  How you gonna do that?  I don't know, but it's going to be a challenge,  like trying to seem sad while you're wearing flip-flops.  - (FLIP-FLOPS SLAPPING) - I'm sorry for your loss.  Sorry for your loss.  Sorry for your loss.  Very sorry.  Let me know if you need anything.  - Very sorry. - Excuse me.  The owner of a Geo Tracker  with the license plate ""FLP FLP,""  you're blocking the funeral procession.  - Oh. - (RAPID SLAPPING)  All right, Chris.  A big part of being a mechanic is being completely shocked  when somebody hasn't had a particular item  - on a restaurant menu. - Hey, Chrissie.  We're thinking about going over to Pete's.  You want a bread sandwich?  - What's a bread sandwich? - What?  You never had a bread sandwich from Pete's?  Everyone who's not currently in the room, get over here.  Griffin's never had a Pete's bread sandwich.  Whoa, whoa, what? You never had a bread sandwich from Pete's?  We've covered this. Somebody tell me what it is.  What do you think it is? It's three pieces of bread.  Me, I like a piece of sourdough on top,  piece of sourdough on bottom,  and a nice piece of wheat in the middle.  I like to go rye, rye, rye.  I'm a rye guy.  Hey, you guys going to Pete's?  Someone get me a bread sandwich.  - Griffin's never had one. - What?  - What? - Guys.  I just called Pete's. They're closed forever.  STUDENTS: What?  Who answered the phone?  All right, Stewie, how do we make Meg popular?  I've got it all figured out.  They're posting the cast list for the school play.  I'll just give Meg all the parts.  That way, she'll be the most popular girl in school.  Good night, good night.  As sweet repose and rest.  Come to thy heart as that within my breast.  (DEEP VOICE): O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?  (GRUNTING, PANTING)  (NORMAL VOICE): What satisfaction  canst thou have tonight?  (GRUNTS) That son of a bitch.  (PANTING)  (DEEP VOICE): Th' exchange of thy love's  faithful vow for mine.  (COCKNEY ACCENT): 'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.  What's all this, then?  (APPLAUSE)  - Well, that didn't work. - Don't worry, Brian.  We've still got the spring musical.  (""THE FARMER AND THE COWMAN"" FROM OKLAHOMA! PLAYING)  One man likes to push a plow   The other likes to chase a cow   But that's no reason why they can't be friends   Territory folks should stick together   Territory folks should all be pals   Cowboys dance with farmers' daughters   Farmers dance with the ranchers' gals.   'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.  What's all this, then?  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  She can't be helped.  Mr. and Mrs. G, thanks so much for having us over for dinner.  Oh, it's our pleasure.  Chris has said so many nice things about you.  Ah, maybe one or two of 'em are true.  (LAUGHTER)  Chris, tell your mom and dad about the story you wrote.  - Oh, I don't know. - Chris, come on, don't be shy.  Okay. It's called ""The Black Duck.""  ""The Black Duck."" You ever seen a black duck?  I seen a brown duck, a yellow duck,  a white duck with a green head.  Hey, there's all kinds of ducks. This kid thinks of a black one.  Come on, it's just a stupid story, guys.  Hey! If it was such a ""stupid story,""  why would it have such a well-rounded protagonist?  Remember what I told you behind the garage?  That you might be gay?  Wh-What? No, no, I didn't say that!  The-the imagination on this one.  Black ducks, I'm gay, what's next?  M-Martians? L-Little green Martian people?  Oh, Chris, I'm so happy you have so many wonderful new friends.  He was very unpopular in high school.  Oh, yeah, you know, he's strong, too.  He takes care of a lot of stuff for us.  ""Stuff""?  Yeah, he-he took care of one of our competitors.  Mr. Firestone says hello.  Ow. Ow. Ow.  - Stop it. Stop it. - (AIR HISSING)  Oh, my God, Chris!  That's silly, but it's still murder!  Relax. That Michelin Man had no family.  He came from tires, Ma!  All right, if we can't make Meg popular,  we can at least find her a boyfriend.  Neil, can you come out? We need to talk to you.  NEIL: I can't open the door. It's the Sabbath.  You can come around the back entrance.  (BOTH SIGH)  Why are all the lights off?  I can't turn them on myself. It's the Sabbath.  Get the lights for me, will you?  Also, can you pick up the phone and order me a pizza?  I can't do it. It's the Sabbath.  Listen, Neil, we really wanted to talk about Meg.  That can wait. I've just looked at some porn,  and I need you guys to give me some assisted relief.  I can't do it myself. It's the Sabbath.  Okay, this-this is starting to sound a little weird.  It's not weird. It's Jewish.  I can't believe we did all that and he still turned us down.  I know, and Al-also, Brian, it's Thursday.  Well, I am officially out of ideas.  Yes, there's literally no one in town  sad and desperate enough to date my sister.  Hey, guys, can you hold my phone and point it over this way?  I want to live-stream my suicide.  Yeah, sure, Kevin.  You know what it is, Stewie? It's a selfishness  It's an inability to look out  and see someone who needs someone.  It's-it's just it's a lack of empathy.  Can you make sure I'm totally in the frame?  Yeah, I'm not a pro. You get what you get.  Anyway, what is wrong with people that they're  so myopic and just preoccupied with their own little lives?  - Is it on? - It's whatever  it was when you handed it to me.  The point is, there's someone out there for everyone  if they're just willing to open their eyes and look.  Wait a second! Don't you see, Brian?  Oh, my God, you're right!  Kevin, before you go through with this,  would you consider taking Meg out for a date?  Meg? Why?  Look, we know you've had a hard road  ever since you came home from Iraq.  Well, this could be a chance for you to help someone else  who maybe feels as bad inside as you do.  Okay. I'll ask her out.  Great. Call her tomorrow.  Tonight she's doing the fall play.  It's a one-woman performance of Hair.  (""LET THE SUNSHINE IN"" FROM HAIR PLAYING)  Let the sunshine   Let the sunshine in   Let the sun shine in.   Should've called it Too Much Hair.  (SLIDE WHISTLE)  (GIGGLES) I finished the book.  All right, Brian. Here comes Meg.  Now, don't let on that we had anything to do  with Kevin asking her out.  Relax. I know how to keep my cool.  You guys!  I'm going out with Kevin Swanson!  Get out of here!  Brian, why are your hands on your hips?  (QUIETLY): Turn it down a notch.  Yeah, he asked me out. Totally out of the blue.  Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.  Get your hand off your cheek, you mess.  Principal Shepherd, we came to ask  if there's anything we can do to get Chris back in the school.  Mr. and Mrs. Griffin, I-I'm afraid we can't do that.  Oh, I think you can.  I think you can do that and a whole lot more.  Oh, my God.  That is not what a testicle is supposed to look like.  Has a doctor seen this?  What are you gonna do, charge me with smoking?  Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid you have testicular cancer.  I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do.  Oh, I think maybe there is.  If you keep doing that, you're gonna pop it.  Stewie, I still don't understand why we have to pretend  to work at the restaurant.  It's all part of the plan, Brian.  Meg and Kevin need to have the perfect date.  That's why I gave the rest of the staff the night off.  We have to be in total control of the evening.  Two for Swanson.  (HIGH-PITCHED): I'm sorry, we have nothing under that name,  - and we're all full. - Oh, I  Uh, actually, I think a table just opened up.  Right this way.  - What the hell? - Sorry, I choked.  Hi. We're the Hollender rehearsal dinner.  There are 46 of us.  Uh, Stewie, before you gave the staff the night off,  did you check the reservation book?  I did not.  And to remind you, 24 of us selected the salmon,  16 the filet, and six vegetarian.  MAN: One vegan.  Five vegetarian, one vegan.  - What do we do? - Just keep giving them crayons  until we figure it out.  More appetizer?  No, thanks.  Cauliflower gives me the scoots.  Chris, there's something your father and I  want to talk to you about.  Uh, Chris? Ch-Chris?  Sorry, I only answer to ""Chrissie"" now.  - Fine. Chrissie? - Yeah, Ma?  Can you stop lifting your rusty weights while we talk to you?  Chris, we're worried about you and your new friends.  Pa, don't worry about it.  ""Don't worry about it.""  - Okay. - No, Peter, it's not okay.  Chris, we don't want you in the Mafia.  Hey, I'm in waste management.  Chris, you need to be back in high school where you belong.  But Principal Shepherd won't let you back in,  and we don't know what to do.  What do I need school for? Tony Danza never went to school,  and he played a guy named Tony on four different TV shows.  Lois, let me handle this.  Chris, I'm gonna say this in a way  an Italian mechanic would understand.  You're breaking your mother's heart!  Ma! Why didn't you say so, Ma?!  I'll take care of it.    (DOOR CREAKS)  (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)  What have you got there?  A guy letting me back into school says what?  - What? Damn it! - Okay, see you on Monday.  - Oh, God. - What? What is it?  The Hollender rehearsal dinner review on Yelp.  ""Undercooked and underwhelmed.  Argumentative staff.""  I thought chicken sushi was wildly inventive.  So, Meg, how was your night out with your boyfriend?  - Actually, we broke up. - Aw.  Aw, Meg, I'm so sorry.  Well, I guess some people are just  meant to be alone, you know?  They're so broken inside.  They're just not worth it.  Don't say that, Meg. You're totally worth it.  I'm not talking about me. I'm talking about Kevin.  He's a psycho. I dumped his ass.  So you're okay with it?  Yeah, it actually felt great to be empowered for once.  Good night, guys.  You know what, Brian, we actually did  make Meg's life a little bit better.  She got to dump someone.  Well, you know what the real lesson is here, Stewie.  Brian, I'm being told the show is running long.  - We've got to speed this up. - Oh, that's okay.  I'm sure they can fix it in editing. What I was saying  Because it's all about family and  In love. You see, the thing is  - Love you, Brian. - Tractor guy now! Who wants a ri  So, Chris, how was your first day back at school?  It was fine. I'll miss the guys at vocational school,  but it is nice to be back where I belong.  - (KNOCK AT DOOR) - I'll get it.  That's him.  That's the one who popped me.  - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure.  Did I not sound sure?"

The Olympic qualifiers are today.  - I'm competing. - In what?  - I'm a bi - Knew it.  - Athlete. - Didn't know it.  If I win today, I'm going to the Olympics.  Why is this the first we're hearing about this?  It's not. God, how could you guys not know about this?  I've been training for years.  Peter. Peter, I need you to hold my ears. Aah!  (BOTH GROANING)  Oh. Oh.  (ALL GROANING)  - Who wants chowder? - (ALL RETCHING)  Okay, I'm off to go train for the Olympics.  Ew!  Mom? Mommy? Mommy?  Mommy? Mama?  Hey, Ma, I'm gonna go train for the Olympics.  Mama? Mama? Ma?  My goal becomes clear: the broccoli must die.  (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)  All right, I'm off to train for the Olympics.  See? I've been training since I was Lacey Chabert.  - So, are you guys gonna come? - I don't know.  The Yule Log Channel just put on another log,  and I really like it when the wood goes ""crack, crack,  pop, crack, pop.""  We all like that. Sorry, Meg.  That's okay.  I guess I'll just drive there by myself  in my Jeep!  Wait a minute. You have a Jeep?  Well, why didn't you say so?  Come on, family!  Let's go do TV commercial driving meant  for a professional driver on a closed course.  ANNOUNCER: Jeep: The toughest four-letter word on wheels.  For the driver who doesn't like to stop going  just because they've run out of road.  Ow, my balls! Why'd you do that?  Head out where the real fun begins.  There was plenty of road left!  Where the paved roads leave off.  Aah! My balls! It's too bumpy.  Potholes and bumps and ruts can come as they will.  Ah, they're getting rattled and smushed.  Jeep's welded, rugged and riveted frame  Please go back on the road!  Takes punishment in large doses  - My balls! - And comes back for more!  I like safe driving. My balls!  Thanks again for coming, guys.  It really means a lot to me.  Of course, honey. We wouldn't miss it.  Plus, it's a good excuse to put on my winter coat  and find items from last year still in the pocket.  Ooh, sticky pennies, a rock-hard Starburst,  an appointment card for my next dental appointment  that's already come and gone,  a ticket stub for a matinee of Interstellar,  an unwrapped piece of Dentyne,  a yarmulke from when that Jewish guy died,  a breath mint from the now-defunct Clorets corporation,  printed-out Mapquest directions to Dave & Buster's,  Iron Man Band-Aid,  Flintstone vitamin I didn't take 'cause it was Barney,  refrigerator magnet from local electrician  who is now arrested,  and balled up tissues with last year's flu on it.  You done with your pocket bits? It's freezing!  So the biathlon combines cross-country skiing  - and rifle shooting? - Yeah.  Well, that doesn't sound so hard. Can I try?  I don't know if that's a good idea.  My event starts soon.  Meg, it is my duty as a bad father to prove  that I can do anything my kids can do.  Okay, fine.  Here we go.  All right, I think I'm getting the hang of it.  I have to say, I'm very proud of Meg.  Who knew she was good at something?  Yeah, does anybody else in the family have any secret talents  we don't know about?  I'm the Quahog edging champion.  That's great, Chris. Now what's that?  It's the practice of erotic sexual denial.  Go wait in the car.  And no edging!  RON HOWARD: But he did continue edging,  bringing himself to the verge of sexual pleasure,  only to stop at the last moment.  I'm Ron Howard, and I do voice-overs  for this show now, too.  KRISTEN BELL: But that was the only voice-over  Ron Howard did for the show.  He asked for too much money.  I'm Kristen Bell, and I do reasonably-priced voice-overs.  MAN: But her voice-overs  were not reasonably priced, so they turned to me,  a guy who sounds like Morgan Freeman,  but is not, in fact, Morgan Freeman.  My name is Josh Robert Thompson,  and I perform for scale.  (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)    You're going down, Meg.  - Lacey Chabert?! - That's right.  This should be my Olympics.  - Shut up, Meg. - No, you shut up, Meg.  No, you shut up, Meg.  PETER: Shut up, Megs!  Yay, Meg!  Wow. Meg is going to the Olympics!  Let's celebrate by burning our lips  on vending machine hot chocolate.  - Ow! - Ugh!  Mine has whipped cream, so I didn't get it  on the first sip.  Ow!  - (CHEERING, APPLAUSE) -   Thank you.  Um, I-I'm not really good at public speaking,  so I'll just say farble shlup muckle blop.  All right, Meg, I'll take it from here.  Hi. I'm Lois Griffin, Meg's mother.  You may also know me as the lady who threw a plate of cheese  during that city council meeting.  (CROWD MURMURING)  But we got the streets plowed, though, right?  (SCATTERED APPLAUSE)  MAN: The cheese worked, yeah.  I just wanted to say how proud we are of Meg's accomplishment.  So it looks like the Griffins are going  to the Winter Olympics in Korea!  (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)  Do you think there'll be a gag about the Jamaican bobsled team?  - No, probably not. - Oh.  'Cause I was working on my exaggerated shiver.  Burr. Burr. Oh.  (JAMAICAN ACCENT): Yeah, man, it be cold.  (LAUGHING): Okay, okay, yeah, yeah, maybe.  There might be. Don't-don't go far. Don't go far.  My race isn't for a few days,  so we should have plenty of time to hang out.  Anyone want to grab some food?  Sorry, Meg, I can't.  I'm trying to land you some endorsements,  and I have a lead with a very popular IBS medication.  Quick, say,  ""I never let traveler's diarrhea keep me grounded.""  No!  Well, then you're just handing this thing right to John Kruk!    Oh, my God, Brian, look.  - Who is that? - Oh, that's figure skater  turned flamboyant commentator Johnny Weir.  I wonder where Tara Lipinski is.  I heard they always have to be  within quipping distance of each other.  Oh, she's in the hat!  Isn't she amazing?  I feel like she's my soul mate.  How is she your soul mate?  She looks like a baby,  and she's best friends with a gay guy.  - Her life is my life. - I'm not gay.  Well, it's not me!  Come on, let's go meet them.  Hi. I just had to come over and introduce myself.  My name is Stewie, and I'm a huge fan of you guys.  Oh, it's nice to meet you, Stewie.  Yeah, it's always so nice to meet our fans.  And can I just say, the shape of your head is stunning.  Really? I get a lot of grief for it.  Some people say it looks like a football.  Okay, I don't know what that is, but they're just jealous.  Every one of them.  Remember, nothing normal looks good.  Well, I have to say, you two are the best thing  to happen to sports  since the New York Knicks finally changed their name.  ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,  please welcome your 2018 New York Pieces-Of-Dog-(BLEEP).  (CROWD BOOING)  (EXHALES)  Bitty bitty bop.  Funky, funky.              Wow, I can't believe  I'm on a first-name basis with Tara Lipinski.  Now, refresh my memory: is Tara the one who had the DUI?  No, that's Oksana Baiul!  Oh, sounds like something Gandalf says  at the foot of a mountain.  Oksana Baiul!  Okay, we can go in now.  Oh, God, here she comes!  Act like I said something funny.  I don't know, Stewie.  I think the Special Olympics serve an important purpose.  So do I! Who thinks they don't?  I don't know. Ask this guy.  He's a dog. He's just learning how to talk.  So, hey, Tara, are you doing anything later?  I was thinking maybe we could grab dinner or something.  Yeah, sure. You seem cool. That could be fun.  All right then, it's a date.  Oh, I just need to make a call.  I was supposed to help the speed skaters  get their tights over their thighs.  (GRUNTING)  Stewie, it's not gonna fit!  Hey, we can do this.  I worked with Garth Brooks. Shirt and pants.  Little secret Garth wears leggings.  The denim pattern is projected on.  Hello, Kansas City!  Stick to the agreed-upon choreography, please.  Ask who else has friends in low places.  BROOKS: Hey, who else here has friends in low places?  (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)  All right, we got 'em back, baby.    Whoa, Ryan Lochte?  - Uh, where? - You.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, are you athlete?  No, I just like wearing clothes that feel like pajamas.  That's most of what being athlete is.  Wait, aren't you a summer sport guy?  Oh it's cold.  Here's a beer. Follow me.  MORGAN FREEMAN: Peter partied all night  with international bozo Ryan Lochte.  And this voice-over was actually covered  by my original payment.  Stewie, I'm very impressed.  I didn't know you skated.  Yeah, well, there's a lot you don't know about me.  Like I'm always full of surprises.  - (SNAPS FINGERS) - (ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS)  - BRIAN: Did it work? - Yes. Yeah.  You were supposed to be quiet!  Would you like to join me for a dance?    Wow!    STEWIE: But that's not how it really happened.  Would you like to join me for a dance?  BRIAN: Oh-ho! Wow.  Ow! Ow! I bit my tongue!  - I swallowed the piece! - Oh, my God, are you okay?  Don't go on the ice. It's too slippery.  I'll crawl back. Don't watch me.  (GROANING)  - Hi, hi, hi. - Oh. Hey, Johnny.  I'm just gonna run to the bathroom real quick. B-R-B.  Oh, she's a regular Tinkle Britches.  (DEEP VOICE): Get the hell out of here, you little maggot.  Wha-Wha Johnny?  - What happened to your voice? - This is my voice.  You think I actually talk like that?  That's just something I do to get the skater chicks.  - Does Tara know? - Nah. She don't like guys like me.  (HIGH-PITCHED): She likes guys like me.  Wait, but she had a great time with me tonight.  (DEEP VOICE): Yeah, that's what she does with her gay friends.  But you're her gay friend.  What'd you say, you little (BLEEP)?!  Is everything okay out here?  (HIGH-PITCHED): Yeah, I was just looking at his shirt.  I love this Nordstrom Rack. How was the tinkle?  It was good. I also dumped.  You're so bad.  Anyway, sad emoji face, Stewie has to leave.  Oh. Okay. Bye, Stewie.  I had a wonderful time.  Me me, too.  (DEEP VOICE): Not as good as I'm gonna have.  And I know what a (BLEEP) football is.  Killed me to say that.  Hey, you flush underwear in train toilet?!  Yeah, they, uh, th-they were done.  This illegal. I want you off train!  What are you gonna do about it?  You're just a train conductor  who has a huge kicking foot?  Aah! Oh!  Where the hell am I?  Oh, my God, I'm in the wrong Korea.  That's it. Like your missiles, I'm about to go ballistic.  PETER: But that's not how it really happened.  That's it. Like your missiles, I'm about to go ballistic.  Ow! A northern bird flew into my nuts!  (GROANS) Go to commercial.  (SNIFFING)  That's weird.  It doesn't smell like open butt in here.  Peter?  Huh, he's usually up by now dry-heaving in the shower.  Hi, I'm pink-eyed Bob Costas,  live from our Pyeongchang studios,  here to bring you breaking news,  and occasionally blink off-synch  in an attempt to satisfy my searing eye itchiness.  A U.S. tourist, Peter Griffin,  has been apprehended by North Korea  and is being held prisoner for what I'm being told  is trespassing and doing that thing with your eyes  that makes you look Chinese.  Damn it. Why does Peter have to ruin every family vacation?  Just like he ruined our trip to La La Land.    Hey, guy who's never been uncool in a movie,  I requested ""Dominick the Donkey""  like an hour ago.  It's Christmastime, and I want greaseball songs.  (SIGHS)    Hey, chingedy ching, hee-haw, hee-haw   It's Dominick the donkey   Chingedy ching, hee-haw, hee-haw   The Italian Christmas donkey   La, la, la-la   Ooh, like the movie!  La-la, la, la, la, la, la   La, la, la, la, la, la-lee, oh, dah!   Again.  (DEEP VOICE): Hey, sorry about last night, bro.  - No hard feelings? - Yes, hard feelings.  I told you, I really liked her.  Yo, relax. We only had awesome sex.  Geez. All right, see you later.  I got to go wash Tara's lipstick off my ass.  Well, at least I have a side,  you neutral Swiss cowards!  Oh, hey, Stewie, how's it going?  Terrible. Johnny Weir's making my life a nightmare.  I really thought I had a shot with Tara Lipinski,  and he ruined it.  I'm sorry to hear that.  You want me to take him out for you?  Really? You'd do that for me?  Of course. I owe you for getting me that job  with Gloria Allred.  (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)  CHRIS: They say if you get a job doing what you love,  you never work a day in your life.  Now it's clothes, now it's clothes,  now it's clothes.  This is for my brother, you Tom Hiddleston lookalike!  - (DEEP VOICE): You serious, bro? - Oh, no.  Now you're gonna beat me up like a Batman fight,  only with gay words.                  Kids, Brian, I've got some bad news.  Your father has been kidnapped by North Korea.  We've got to save him.  But my race is this afternoon.  I know, but your father needs us.  I don't care. Where was he when I needed help?  Where were any of you guys?  This was supposed to be my week.  Down here, it's my time. It's my time down here!  - Is that from Goonies? - I think so, yeah.  So you guys can all go.  But I'm staying here, and I'm competing.  And I'm gonna go inside, outside, inside, outside.  And I'm gonna get 'em on the run, boys.  And once I get 'em on the run, I'm gonna keep 'em on the run.  Wow, she knows a lot of Sean Astin speeches.  Go. You don't care.  The only thing you care about is nugs, chilling and grindage.  Encino Man. Sean Astin, deep cut.  Me? Oh  ANNOUNCER: Racers, take your mark.  (STARTING GUN FIRES)  SPECTATOR: Go, everyone but her.  (CHEERING)    Wait, before you kill me,  can you at least give me an extra bullet  so I can pretend to catch one in my teeth?  (GUNS CLICKING)  MEG: Lacey Chabert!  Meg!    (GROANS)  Meg, that was amazing!  But how we gonna get out of here?  - We're surrounded. - There's only one way.  An impossible video game escape.  Ooh, can it be GoldenEye?  - Sure. - Yes!      PETER: Bond. James Bond.  Don't worry, Meg, it's less sad because they don't bleed.  Oh, don't shoot this guy. He was nice to me.  Aw, never mind.  These guys are terrible shots.  I love this almost James Bond music.  Meg, this is what 1997 looked like.  It's my turn next try. I want to go next.  You think one guy had to shovel this whole walkway?  Oh, great, more stairs.  This is how you know we're done.  Peter, you're safe!  Yep, and it's all thanks to Meg.  But, Meg, what about your race?  Well, I realized that it wasn't worth doing  if you guys weren't there with me.  Oh, Meg, we are so sorry  for how we treated you this week.  You may not have won a gold medal in the games,  but you won one in our hearts.    What do you say, guys, should we go home?  I don't know, I'm thinking maybe we can  hang out a little bit longer,  see what else Korea has to offer Uh-oh.  No! You leave Korea now!  - (GRUNTS) - PETER: Meet me wherever I land!  MORGAN FREEMAN: Peter landed somewhere in the DMZ,  and was recaptured by North Korea.  Fortunately, tensions caused by this international incident  were resolved by the steady hand  of Dennis Rodman,  who let Kim Jong-un win  in a one-on-one basketball game against him,  continuously saying, ""Oop, you got me,""  in a way that was just convincing enough  for Kim to believe."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy.    (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  So what's the big emergency?  Why did everyone have to come in on a Monday?  I'm afraid we have troubling news.  Due to budget cuts, we'll be laying off one employee.  (INDISTINCT MURMURING)  The Internet pretty much only lets us fire white males,  so if you're not a white male, you're safe.  - So, is Derek Jeter safe? - Safe!  - What? - He's half black.  - What? What do you need, glasses? - No, I don't need glasses.  He's white by a mile. He tucks  You're the one who needs glasses.  And what happened to this kind of coach-umpire confrontation?  - I know, I miss it, too. - It used to happen a lot in the '70s  but doesn't seem to happen that much anymore.  to a bygone era when men settled their differences  I agree. That's what we're doing now.  Thrusting their chests into one another.  I miss having a guy yell in my mouth.  And while we're talking about stuff, I've never cleaned my ice trays.  - Oh, you have to do that. - Why do I have to?  - You're poisoning your family. - It's just water and water.  Carrying an ice tray from the freezer to the sink is like ringing  - the damn dinner bell for arm hairs. - Come to think of it,  but I don't remember seeing a few short hairs in my ice cubes  Of course they're getting in there.  - That I'm hoping were from my arm. - Clean your trays.  Oh, cool off, Griffin. It is no big deal.  It's just that someone's getting fired  - in front of everybody tomorrow. - Well, that sounds fine.  I guess I'll just see you What?!  Old joke. You're out.  - Old joke? I put my own twist on it. - There was no twist.  Oh, you're crazy. It was a tip of the hat to my son.  If anything, it's a gift to our long-time viewers.  Merry Christmas. Here's a warmed-over turd  from ten years ago.  Okay, I can do this.  No need to be nervous. Just show 'em that I'm good at my job.  That's it. Easy peasy.  (CHUCKLES): Hey there, PG.  Been a minute.  Hey, Ernie. I mean, I mean Cookie Monst I mean Bert.  Bert. Sorry.  Oh, it's okay, Peter.  Just do what you would normally do.  Pretend I'm not here.  Oh, pretend you're not here? All right.  God, that Bert is an idiot.  What a pud.  But I wouldn't mind getting to know that Sheila  a little better.  She's got a great dumper.  And by dumper, I mean fecal thoroughfare.  - (PHONE RINGING) - Should I?  Yeah, answer it.  Could be important for the company.  (EXHALES)  Goodbye?  Ah, shoot. Opposite of that, yeah?  Let's roll to the break room, Peter.  We're ready to announce who's getting fired.  Oh, sure, if Sheila and her wastemaker are gonna be there.  Please stop talking about my wife's anal processes.  Opie, will you accept this stein?  (BABBLING)  Bachelor Nick? Why are you here?  They make me come to all these things.  Cool. How's Vanessa?  - We broke up. - Aw.  I would murder my family for one hour with Corinne.  Eh, she was a little young.  You know how stupid you sound?  Peter, take a step forward.  I-I'm sorry. I-I keep messing up.  You're seeing me at my worst. I'm very nervous.  (HEART BEATING)  My life is flashing before my eyes.  And for some reason, it's all just the sort of gay moments.    Excuse me, is someone sitting here?  Yes. My lover, Tom.  (GASPS)  Oh, Peter! I'm so happy you're okay.  Whoa, you're alive?  What happened? Did I have a heart attack?  No, you had a panic attack.  Or, in medical terms, ""a heart attack for wussies.""  Hey, we have a bet going.  Do you remember if you put your wrist to your forehead  like a nancy-boy when you fainted?  I choose not to answer.  Peter, you need to get your stress under control.  I'm texting you a link to a collection of songs  called yacht rock.  Any time I'm feeling stressed,  I play this music, and it really mellows me out.  - I think it'll work for you. - Well, what is that? Is that like  (ANGRY):  Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da.   No, no, it's more like  (MELLOW):  Ia, da, da, da, da   Da, da, da, da, da.   Oh, good. It's  Ia, da, da, da, da   Da, da, da, da.  'Cause I don't like that.  (ANGRY):  Da, da, da, ba, ba, ba.   No, I assure you, it's Ia, da, da, da   Da, da, da, da, da, da, da.   Now, if you'll excuse me,  I have more music to prescribe to sick patients.  - So, Peter, you feeling better? - Yeah, I guess.  The doctor just said I'm too stressed out.  Did the doctor give you anything to help, you know,  mellow you out?  Â¿Los drogas?  No, he just gave me this link for something called yacht rock.  (""SUMMER BREEZE"" BY SEALS AND CROFTS PLAYING)  This one's called ""Summer Breeze,""  and it makes me feel fine.  This music I  I feel like I'm dirty dancing with a sunset.    Uh, guys, there's a yacht rock cruise  that leaves from the Quahog Marina tomorrow.  And I'm not even kidding.  You know what, guys? We haven't gone anywhere in a long time.  So, let's do it.  Cleveland, buy those tickets,  'cause the guys are going on a yacht rock cruise.  - Yeah! - Awesome!  Peter? Is that you?  - Do I know you? - I-It's me. Lyle?  From the other side of the aquarium?  I-I I don't I don't know you.  I-I don't I don't know what you're talking about.  But I did know what he was talking about.  I spent the next two and a half years  cruising various aquariums.  I never did find Lyle.  Also, I didn't quite clear the table.  I got to say, Peter, I had reservations about this cruise,  but you do seem more relaxed.  Hey, good thing I had reservations  on this cruise, huh?  (CHUCKLES) I don't mind dad jokes.  Everyone's included.  Looks like mine won't be the only tail  I'll be chasing this week.  -(GRUNTS) Hey. What the - All dogs have to be crated below deck.  (DOGS BARKING)  Stewie, help!  I knew this was a possibility, so I put  a 1982 Mattel Electronic Baseball game in your bag.  Okay, that's something.  The battery might be a little old, though.  (ELECTRONIC FANFARE FADES)  (HORN BLOWS)  Peter, you brought your family?  This was supposed to be a guys' trip.  Please don't tell Donna. - Please don't tell Bonnie.  - She hasn't been on a vacation - She'll kill me if  - Please, Lois, please. - Please, Lois.  - Promise me. Here, look, - Promise me first.  - I'm putting money - Here's my gun. Do you want it?  - In your purse. - I-I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.  I'm sending a selfie to Bonnie and Donna.  Cruise, bitches.  - Don't hit send, please don't hit send. - Please don't hit send.  And send.  (PHONE CHIMES)  You son of a bitch.  - I told you. - What did he do now?  He don't listen to you.  He don't listen to you.  (PHONE VIBRATES)  What is it, Bonnie?  Nothing, Father Monaghan.  - Well, this sucks now. - Our whole trip's ruined,  thanks to you, Peter.  Thank God Bonnie's got Father Monaghan  for spiritual counsel.  Well, it's not my fault you guys are too stupid  to understand what the plan was.  The plan was clear. You're the stupid one.  - What? - (OVERLAPPING ARGUING)  Sailing takes me away   - What were we fighting about? - I don't know.  My cares have all suddenly melted away.  Are my toes tapping? I feel like my toes are tapping.  Nah, there's a seagull pecking at your foot.  (SQUAWKING)  Whenever I wear my Tevas,  my toes are up for grabs.  Hey, Cleveland, this is us.  You guys got to stop by later.  Snuck on a little of this action.  What? You guys are sharing a room?  - You're adults. - I'm not paying full price for a room.  Have some self-respect. You're 40.  (SCOFFS) It's not like we're gonna be in there much.  Too busy scoping trim.  I may bail to the room to catch a nap.  Right behind you, roomie.  After we wake, we gonna fire up that Keurig.  Oh, yeah, that's why I brought along a couple of these babies.  Wait, there's only one bed.  I know. We're going head to toe.  Say hello to your pillow.  Hi there, do you know if singer and songwriter Bob Welch  is on board yet?  He's not, because he died in 2012.  (GASPS)  Can you give me a moment?  Sentimental gentle wind   Blowing through my life again   I can't believe Bob Welch is really gone.  Gentle one   Hey we just heard about Bob Welch.  Blowing through my life again   Yeah.  Who the (BLEEP) is Bob Welch?  (HORN BLOWS)  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Okay, for the first game, I choose Alan Parsons  as my teammate, but not The Project.  I want nothing to do with them.  We'll play Joe and Loggins.  - Thanks for picking me, Peter. - No problem.  ""Crosby, Stills, Nash"" to see who goes first?  BOTH: Crosby, Stills, Nash, shoot.  - Nash. I win. - No, Crosby eats Nash.  - Stills snorts Crosby. - What does Nash do?  Nash smokes Stills.  So, Kenny, ""Footloose.""  Not really a song for everyone.  Well, maybe you'd prefer my song in Caddyshack, ""I'm Alright.""  Wh-What, do you think I'm stupid because I'm in a chair?  I'll pull the tape, guy.  The gopher sang that song.  This is so exciting. What do you want to do tonight?  What if we just go see a movie?  We can see a movie at home. We need to go out.  Shake things up.  We're here to experience new things, be other people.  Mm-hmm.  How much wine have you had tonight?  Maybe we could hang out with that nice couple  - we met the other day. - The Federmans?  Why do you always want to hang out with other people  when we're on vacation?  It's just nice to meet new people.  Right, because I'm so interested in the medical supply business.  - Why do you always do that? - Do what?  Diminish people.  Oh, that's why.  Well, I feel like this has become a referendum on me,  and I don't appreciate it.  Did you pack my dandruff shampoo?  - No. - (SIGHS)  Then I guess this black shirt is out.  You just want to hang out with Doug Federman.  What? That's that's the wine talking.  What does Doug Federman have that I don't?  - A job. - (GRUNTS)  I'm going to watch the magic show in the Cognac Club.  Why, because there's a two-drink minimum?  Oh, you shut up!  - (APPLAUSE) - Thank you.  For my next trick, I'll need a volunteer.  - How about you, sir? - No, I don't want to!  I don't want to do it.  BOTH: Bell, Biv, DeVoe, shoot.  - (LAUGHS) Gotcha. - What do you mean?  I win. Bell bivs DeVoe.  Dude, you can't ""biv"" someone. Biv's a guy.  Everybody on this cruise is boring.  CHAD: I can show you where there's a whole pile of those.  Cigarette butts?  Yeah. The wind blows them all to this one spot.  It's right by where the seagulls crap.  It's my job to clean it up. That's how I know about it.  You must know a lot about crap.  You're not from here, are you?  From the cruise? No. I'm from a town.  You want to mess around on some damp towels  next to where the seagulls crap?  It wasn't seagulls.  I got locked out of my room earlier.  Oh.  - Why is your poop white? - I don't know.  I've been dealing with fecal albinism my whole life.  All I want to do in the middle of the evening   Is hold you tight   Rosanna, Rosanna   I didn't know you were looking for more than   I could ever be   Hey, what are you guys up to?  We're making a food spread in room 103.  Come on by.  Grab some cocktail sauce on your way.  Oh, wait. Never mind.  Aah! Damn it.  We're watching Michael Clayton on DVD later. Be there.  (INDISTINCT WHISPERING)  By the way, I, uh, heard about Bob Welch.  I'm sorry.  - Don't know what else to say. - (EXHALES)  - Sending good vibes. - Yeah  Can you give me a moment?  Sentimental gentle wind   Blowing through my life again   Sentimental Lady   - Bob Welch? - Bob Welch.  - Hey, aren't you the captain? - Yes.  Well, if you're here, who's driving the boat?  Oh, my God!  (ALARMS BEEPING)  Wow, I've never seen someone eat so many powdered Donettes  in half an hour before.  Yeah, I was really hungry,  and I didn't like what they had at dinner.  I think we may have solved your fecal albinism.  I love you, Meg.  Oh, my God,  no one's ever told me that before.  This is the best night of my li  (SCREAMING)  (GRUNTS)  (SCREAMING)  (CHUCKLES) Listen to all those idiots fall.  - Honey, don't revel in it. - Hey, I need this.  I just found out Bob Welch died.  Sentimental gentle wind   Blowing   - Aah! What are we gonna do? - I don't know.  And, look, Oates is hanging on to Hall for dear life.  (GRUNTING)  What else is new? He's been doing that for 40 years.  Ha, ha. Yeah, make fun of more people  more successful than you.  He's a millionaire.  You're nothing.  (CRYING, GROANING)  Oh, thank God we're all okay.  Looks like Oates wasn't so lucky.  (MUFFLED CRYING, GROANING)  Guys, it's me, Kenny Loggins.  First of all, I'm all right.  Don't nobody worry about me.  JOE: Gopher!  This boat has flipped over. We need to get up to the hull.  There's a spot in the propeller room  where the hull's only an inch thick.  Maybe we can try to cut our way out  (SCREAMING)  (SHOUTS)  MEG: Hey, you sons of bitches!  This is Chad!  He's my boyfriend. We love each other.  We said it and everything.  (STIFLED CHUCKLING)  A little help?  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  (SHOUTING)  (PANTING)  Hi-yah!  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  Preesh.  (SCREAMING)  Guys, we got to get out of here.    - You're alive. - And well.  We got to get out of here. The water levels are rising fast.  I'll just grab an apple real quick.  Granny Smith? What, do you got a oven in your mouth?  - Huh? - Pie apple. It's a pie apple.  I like a good Red Delicious.  Oh, does your mouth have a lid on it?  What are you talking about?  That's a garbage apple. May as well eat a Honeycrisp.  - What's wrong with that one? - Science apple.  Made in a lab with test tubes and beakers.  Well, what apples do you like?  Fuji for eating, crab for huckin'.  That's a prankster's apple.  Gosh, Cleveland, I had no idea you knew so much about apples.  - Hmm. Did you ever ask? - No, I guess I didn't.  Hmm.    (GRUNTING) I can't open it!  There's too much water pushing from the other side!  So we're stuck?  Yeah, unless we can somehow tip the boat.  Maybe we can.   What are you talking about, Michael McDonald?  The timbre in my voice   Allows me to communicate with whales.   Maybe they can help.   (HIGH-PITCHED SINGING)    (GRUNTS)  Oh, we oh, we found him.  (BLEEP)! You guys left me down there to drown.  Technically, we left you up there to drown.  - The boat flipped. - You know what you did.  I think the only way to teach you a lesson  is to dog-shake and get you all wet.  - No, Brian, don't! - I'm doing it.  (OVERLAPPING PROTESTS)  All right, we're even.  (CREAKING)  Well, we found the thinnest part of the hull,  but it's still an inch thick.  Yeah, of steel. How are we supposed to get through that?  (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS)  (ALL INHALE DEEPLY)  Man, that was crazy.  I'm Casey Kasem.  Coming in at number seven on the countdown,  that was Peter Griffin with ""Yacht Rocky,""  down three spots.  Now for our number six.  CHORUS:  Number six.   We'll start with a letter from Melanie in Kansas.  She writes, ""Dear Casey,  ""is Christopher Cross as nice as he seems?  ""Also, aren't you dead?  ""And why did your large wife  ""hide your body from your children?""  Well, the answer to your first question is a resounding yes.  Christopher Cross is a perfect gentleman.  And as for the second question,  you're correct, Melanie.  I'm extremely dead,  and I do wish my children could have closure.  Honey, if you're listening, please,  just put my body in the ground.  And now back to the countdown."

I'm actually popping a leg pimple, mister smarty pants.  Damn it, I'm sick of us always forgetting our great ideas  when we're drinking.  Well, down at work, we wear body cams.

Seriously, we're cool with it.  Throw your butts on the ground. We don't care.  Watch real loud trucks and smell the smoke  that reminds you of your dead alcoholic stepdad  who you're glad is dead but still miss anyway.  Rest in peace, Gene.  Forget which beer can is your ashtray.  And whenever you feel like it, shout racial stuff.  You will not be the fattest person there,  and if you are, get that shirt off!  Come get your picture taken with Tila Tequila,  and smoke a cigarette with her.  Spray soda on somebody. Punch a baby.  Smoke inside. Loud trucks, guns.  It's all happening at the Quahog Convention Center,  so hold in all your farts till this Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!  - Farts. - (FLATULENCE)  All right, here we go.  Million-dollar business ideas.  Open forum, no self-editing. Wide-open slate.  No such thing as a bad idea.  - Beer in a bag. - Bad idea.  Oh, oh, I got one. Big Tic Tac,  so you don't have to eat so many little Tic Tacs.  Nice, Glenn, you're on the board.  All right, any ideas. No bad ideas.  - Soup in a sleeve. - Bad idea.  All right, Peter, you're so great,  why don't you give us an idea?  Okay, you know how they put ice in urinals?  Well, what happens to that ice at the end of the day?  It's wasted. We collect urinal ice  and sell it to local bars.  Peter, that'll never work.  Oh, no?  Is that the tinkling of ice I hear?  All right, let's check out what we did last night.  QUAGMIRE: God, that's so shaky.  CLEVELAND: It's hard to watch.  PETER: What is that one?  JOE: That's mine. I'm basically a human Steadicam.  - It's beautiful. - So smooth.  Lot of guy butts.  Yeah, my sight line's a little lower than most.  Look at a girl butt once.  What the hell were we doing here?  PETER: Oh, this must have been when we were jumping around  to ""Jump Around,"" like the song asked us to.  JOE: Oh, yeah, I was so into this song.  Look at my footage. I was going bananas.  PETER: All right, let's fast-forward a little here.  Just looks like we're drinking at a random bar.  We ain't talking about any million-dollar ideas.  Wait, wait, pause it. Zoom in on that napkin.  What does that say?  There it is. ""Warm cuts.""  Like cold cuts, but warm.  Our million-dollar idea.  Warm cuts? That's dumb.  If it's so dumb, how come we're pitching it on Shark Tank?  PETER (ON TV): Now, when we first started Warm Cuts,  it was just a gross idea.  But this year, we're on track to get sued  for $12.5 million.  That's quadruple the projections.  You know what, I like your product.  But more than that, I like you guys.  I'm in, and I'll give you exactly what you're asking for:  $100,000 for ten percent.  What do you say?  PETER: Does anyone other than Robert have an offer?  Wait, why are only three of us on Shark Tank?  Yeah, where's Quagmire?  Oh, my God, is that  Quagmire, you hooked up.  All right.  Oh, no, wait, wait. It's on film.  That's not all right. What if my boss sees this?  What if my dad sees it?  It's fine, Glenn. You can't even see your face.  You did it again, Glenn Quagmire.  Oh, my God. Joe, you have to delete this footage.  Sorry, Glenn, the footage is automatically uploaded  to the Internet every night.  The Internet?! Oh, my God.  Excuse me, ma'am, no porn at the bar.  Oh, it's okay, I'm transgender.  Oh, I-I had no idea.  Do whatever you want all the time.  Oh, Glenn  BRIAN: Howdy, stranger.  Brian? What are you doing here?  - I'm an alcoholic. - Oh, right.  So, you saw the video, huh?  Oh, yeah. It's just so hard.  Well, it has to be for sex.  No, no, I mean-I mean it's difficult  to watch your son embarrass himself so publicly.  Yeah, that parent-child relationship is so special.  Sometimes you want to shake 'em by the shoulders  and say, ""Aah, what are you doing?""  But you just got to give 'em the biggest hug you can  and let 'em know that you'll always be there for them.  - How's your son, Brian? - We don't talk.  But, Ida, you can't blame yourself.  As much as you want to save your kids from their mistakes,  it's their mistakes that help them grow and change  and become their best selves.  You know, Brian, that's what I like about you.  You're so wise and kind.  I think that's what originally drew me to you.  Yep, here I am, Mr. Wisdom,  sitting at the bottom of a bottle,  just like every Tuesday.  - Brian, it's Thursday. - Oh, boy.  Why do you always run yourself down?  You're handsome, you're loyal.  You give your paw after a couple of tries.  Come on, paw.  Paw. Paw  There you go. Good boy.  I just wish you could see yourself the way I see you.  Ehh, mirrors kind of freak me out.  (LAUGHS) And-and funny, too.  Except for a job and your own home,  you are the full package, Brian Griffin.  Ida should we get a room?  Absolutely.  (SCOFFS) They've got one person working back there.  Morning, sleepyhead.  - Morning. - Some night, huh?  Yeah, it really was.  They dropped a USA Today outside our room.  - You want to read it? - Oh, God, no.  Well, I guess we'll pretend this never happened,  and I'll see you in another two years.  (LAUGHS) Yeah.  You know what? No.  What are you doing Friday night?  Well, that depends.  Is Friday Night Videos still a thing?  No, it hasn't been for quite some time.  Well, then, I'm free.  Does that mean you're asking me out?  I guess it does.  You're not ashamed to be with me?  No, I'm not. I don't care anymore.  I guess I'm just not as hung up as I used to be.  - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - MAN: Room service.  Oh, my God, you ordered room service?!  Are you crazy?  What if somebody finds out I'm in here  having goofball sex?  - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - MAN: Hello? Room service.  I've got your eggs and Snausages.  Snausages.  Table 13. The fish is for the gentleman,  and the chicken is for the lady.  Got it.  Great. Is that our food?  WAITER: The fish is for the gentleman,  and the chicken is for the lady.  I'll be right back, folks.  Well, thanks for picking me to break in  your new Discover card with.  Hey, thanks for co-signing for it.  My pleasure.  (YAWNING)  Brian, I can't help but notice  you're a little uncomfortable spending time with me.  I thought you said you weren't ashamed of me.  What are you talking about?  Because I made you lie down in the back seat  all the way here? You looked tired.  It just seems like you're always taking me  to out-of-the-way places to avoid being seen together.  - Like yesterday. - Come on, that's not true.  I just wanted to show you a beautiful view.  Wow, check out that big blue marble.  Look, there's another shuttle.  - Get away from the window! - (GROANS)  Okay, maybe, maybe this has been  a little weirder for me than I thought.  I'm sorry, Ida. I  I really care about you and you deserve better.  - Can I help you? - The fish is for  The fish is for me. And the chicken  the chicken is for my girlfriend, Ida Davis.  ""Girlfriend""? Are you sure, Brian?  I'm sure.  And from now on, I'm not hiding anything.  Like Peter and his formaldehyde jars.  - Peter? - Yes?  Is this is about my work?  Hi, I have a Styrofoam cooler with weird tape on it?  Ah, that must be the cat brains and baby bodies.  Are you making people?  (LAUGHS): He'll be flattered you called him that.  (CACKLES)  (CLEARS THROAT) Hello, everybody.  I have some pretty big news.  - It may come as a surprise, but - It's about Ida, isn't it?  It has to be. Why else would Ida be in our house?  Meg's right. I-Ida's only been here, what,  - like, twice her whole life? - You think they did it again?  - Well, what else could it be? - They do have a lot in common.  Two mature people with dwindling options.  Like, I know Brian was squeamish about sleeping  with a trans woman before, but it's 2019 now.  Yeah, things that were gross five years ago are now heroic.  Wow. Brian and Ida. Good for them.  Well, that's a relief.  Now the only other person we have to tell about us is Glenn.  Oh, God, I haven't even thought about that.  Mr. Quagmire hates Brian.  Yes, my big brother's right.  Quagmire thinks Brian's trash.  Well, just have him over here for dinner.  We'll help you. We're here for you, Brian.  You know what? You're right. I can do this.  After all, I'm not the first person to deliver tough news.  Like when they found Waldo.  There are many things I can't go into at this time,  but I can confirm that a body was removed  from Waldo's apartment this morning.  REPORTER: Is this being treated as a suicide?  Again, I can't confirm.  But to that point, instead of always asking ""Where's Waldo?""  maybe some of you should've been asking ""How's Waldo?""  Good day.  Glenn, Ida, it's so nice  that you could both come over for dinner.  Thanks so much for having us.  (PHONE VIBRATES)  No response from Peter. What the hell?  I thought we were going to the Clam.  And Quagmire just texted back ""Can't.""  I don't like it.  They're doing something without us.  So, Brian, what's, uh, what's new in your world?  (CLEARS THROAT) Oh, well, um,  thank you for asking, Lois.  - I see them. - They're both in there.  Looks like a dinner party!  Uh, actually, I have some news that happens to pertain  - to my dating life. - Really, Brian?  - Oh, do tell us. - I knew it!  Well, it's kind of big news.  Those scalloped potatoes?  Well, what's the big news?  Go ahead, Brian. Tell him.  Ida and I  have, uh  begun dating.  You're, you're joking, right?  It's true, son. Brian and I are in love.  What?! When were you gonna tell me this?  - (PHONE CHIMES) - Oh, Peter just texted.  He says he's stuck at work.  (SIGHS) They are working that poor man to death.  I'm so glad you dropped in. Brian is cooking breakfast.  That's right, get ready for Eggs a la Brian.  Scrambled eggs with a side of toast.  What? How is that ""a la Brian""? That, that's just  That's, that's great. That's just great, Brian.  I am very excited for this unique breakfast.  Cool, cool. How many globs of ketchup do you want?  Uh, chef's choice.  So, um, how long has this been going on, Dad?  Listen, Glenn, I know this is an adjustment for you,  and you and Brian haven't always seen eye to eye.  Well, I wouldn't say that.  He's just, uh, kind of a big personality. (CHUCKLES)  So, Denver Airport.  Kind of up there, huh? Mile-high.  Yeah, that is the height of the airport.  Now, O'Hare Airport, why on the ticket is it ""ORD""?  Uh, it was originally called Orchard Field.  Really? Huh.  Uh, so why is Wilkes-Barre/Scranton ""AVP""?  I'm not gonna go through every airport with you, Brian.  You know, Glenn, Brian thought you two could hang out  this afternoon, and I think that's a great idea.  Yeah, Quagmire, what do you say?  (SHUDDERING)  All right. I guess I can do that.  - Well, great. - (OVEN TIMER CHIMES)  Oh, the ketchup's hot.  Everyone goes cold, I go hot.  And that's the ""a la.""  This sucks. I don't want to be here.  Come on, Glenn. If I'm gonna be dating your mom,  it's important that we spend some time together.  Hi, we have two guest passes from a museum member, Ida Davis.  I'm not seeing an ""Ida Davis.""  (QUIETLY): Uh, try ""Dan Quagmire.""  - ""Lieutenant Dan Quagmire."" - Ah, the lieutenant.  And how's he doing? Still have his penis?  No, he doesn't.  And that's a weird question to ask.  I'm a weird guy, I work at a museum.  See? It's not so bad.  It's like Night at the Museum in here.  - How? - Well, you know,  like, the guys are gonna come to life.  - Like, who? - Um, the guys, you know?  When it's, when it's nighttime.  - You didn't see the movie, did you? - No.  Why did you bring up a reference to something  you know nothing about?  I it just, it reminded me of, uh  Brian, don't bring up a reference to someone  whose favorite movie it is,  because you'll just embarrass yourself.  That was a natural history museum,  this is a science museum.  What, you think this tidal chart's gonna come to life?  You think this moon rock is gonna walk across the room  and riff brilliantly like Robin Williams  playing Teddy Roosevelt, God rest both their souls?  Be very, very careful treading around Night at the Museum.  Okay, let's get this game started.  - Do you believe it still fits? - From when?  Thank you for throwing this barbecue.  It's so good for the boys to spend real time together.  Okay, let's play. Kids versus the parents.  All right, we're gonna destroy those kids.  Uhp, someone's on the wrong team.  Boy, they're in such a hurry not to be kids anymore.  Your time will come, trust me.  I'm older than the adults. I'm older than all of you!  It seems like that sometimes, I bet.  - Get down there, champ. - (SIGHS)  All right, as the one adult on a team full of children,  I'm gonna act good-natured  while being subtly furious at all your mistakes.  Okay? Break on three.  One, two, three  - Break! - Football!  Let's focus, Chris. Can we just focus for a minute?  And let's all face the same direction.  Okay, I'm gonna call the plays  while I'm covering my mouth with this play card.  Peter, that's not a play card, it's a Denny's menu.  Let's run Moons Over My Hammy on three.  Hey, guys? Gonna need your help over here.  They got a real All-American at QB.  (QUIETLY): God.  Down. Hut! Hut!  Good hutting, Glenn. That's my boy, hutting.  Way to hut!  Shut up. Stop complimenting things that don't need it.  Hike!  Uh-oh, look who's on the loose.  I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you  Oh, no, I missed you by total accident.  Yeah! Six points, bitches.  (CHUCKLES): Whoa, that was some great move, buddy.  - (DINGS) - Aw.  Did you see and hear the wink?  That means he did it on purpose.  No, no, way. He did it all by himself.  (DINGS)  Ah! There it is again!  Brian, you're the best dad ever.  What're you talking about? I beat him.  I wish I had a dad like that.  Me, too, bud.  Brian, you're very sweet to do that.  To do what? I'm the one who scored the touchdown.  - You sure did, Glenn. - He's not my dad!  I already have a dad, and it's my mom! All right, Brian?  Stop trying to be my dad, you fraud.  Glenn, sweetie, calm down.  No, I'm not gonna calm down. I can't take this anymore.  Listen, Dad, the first time you hooked up with Brian,  it was awful, I hated it.  But you were confused, you'd just gone through a huge change,  you didn't know if you had any options, so you settled.  But you're a beautiful, intelligent woman.  And now you've had time to adjust and your choice is Brian?  Why in God almighty would you choose him?  ""Because I love him,"" a resolved Ida said.  - I'm also a published author. - Self-published.  You're also a pompous, pretentious,  hypocritical blowhard.  - Who attended Brown. - For one semester.  - You went to Brown? - For two months.  See? See, that's what I mean.  His whole life is a lie.  I can't take this anymore. It's either him or me.  - I choose Brian - Yes.  To talk to first.  Brian, I've loved every minute that we've spent together.  I never thought I'd meet someone  who I connected with on so many levels,  - much less an Ivy Leaguer. - Come on  But as special as you are to me, I have to put my son first.  - But Ida - He's my son.  I've made my decision.  Bye-bye, Brian. You're history.  And this time, history's not coming back to life.  Night at the Museum.  I'm sorry, Brian.  I'll never forget what we had together.  I understand.  Can you guys wrap this up?  I see Peter coming with some kind of problem from the game.  (CRYING): Quagmire, we agreed that it was a two-hand touch,  and then Chris hit me with one hand,  and I said that didn't count,  but he still wouldn't count the touchdown.  So I drilled him in the head with the ball,  and now he's not moving.  He can blink his eyes, but nothing else.  - So, is my dog still your dad? - Uh, no.  Chris, he said the touchdown counts!

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!   (CHILDREN SHOUTING, LAUGHING)   (WHISTLE BLOWS)  Go, Stewie!  Ha! Isn't this exciting?  Yeah, but I don't like little Kyle Kaepernick  kneeling during the national anthem.  (""STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"" PLAYING)  Boo! Get on your feet!  Boo! Down in front.  Okay, need to stay focused.  What are those for?  Power songs that get me focused.  The wheels on the bus go round and round   All through the town.   It's the same thing Ryan Lochte listens to before a race.  Stewie, you're taking this way too seriously.  It's a meaningless event, like a bar mitzvah.  Today you are a man.  - Great. Can I drive? - No.  - Can I vote? - No.  - Can I drink? - No.  - Can I have sex? - No.  - Can I cash the checks? - Yes!  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Lois, why'd we got to come here?  This place is a bunch of rich snobs.  We have lunch with my parents twice a year.  Consider yourself lucky.  Under normal circumstances,  you'd never be allowed in a place like this.  Griffin, come on. They're waiting for your order.  Sorry. Do you have oysters?  - We do not. - Aw, shucks.  (LAUGHTER)  Damn it, Griffin, you've been staring at that menu  for five minutes, and you peed your pants.  Um, do you have oysters?  Get up. They have to clean the chair.  Hey, Brian, you don't have a metal detector on you, do you?  Okay, Stewie, you got a medal. Way to go.  Do I sense a hint of jealousy?  Stewie, didn't it strike you as odd  that everyone got a medal?  You didn't win anything. It's a participant medal.  They give 'em to every kid with a pulse.  And like every other medal or award you've ever gotten,  it means nothing.  What?  (GASPS)  Stewie, I-I'm sorry.  I-I shouldn't have said that. I lost my temper.  - (SOBBING) - Slow down!  (GASPS)  No, no, no, no, no.  How could I be such a fool?  This is a wall of lies.  And that's a hole of lies.  Everything I've ever won is worthless!  Aah!  You won't make a fool of me any longer.  Oh, no! It's all right, Stewie.  Stay calm. This is why we have a house fire captain.  Okay, when I read your name, please respond with a ""here.""  - Griffin, Mac. - It's Meg.  Sorry, it looks like ""Mac.""  - Griffin, Liam. - It's Lois.  Again, please respond with ""here.""  Oh, my God, Chris is still in there!  Somebody save Chris!  (BYSTANDERS GASPING)  (CHEERING)  You know what? He's earned that.  God, look at this place.  Our whole house is destroyed.  Oh, here comes the insurance guy.  Everyone start crying about losing your new golf clubs  and Grant Wood's American Gothic.  Oh  my new golf clubs with the titanium shafts.  Oh, my classic depiction of the austere steadfastness  of rural America!  You know, I don't care. It's not my money.  Oh.  Peter, I spoke with my parents,  and we can live with them until our house is fixed.  Great. It's gonna suck worse than Mueslix.  You know, the German health cereal?  Guten Morgen. Try me.  I am made of oats and fiber.  Okay. Sounds healthy.  Ja. Also, I am German  and wouldn't mind watching you crap.  - Uh, I don't know. - Come, come.  It will be mine and yours little secret.  Just the two of us. Please, take me home.  Uh, okay. But just you.  I don't feel safe now.  Stop talking! Concentrate on the pooping!  ANNOUNCER: Mueslix, the weird European cereal  that likes to watch you poop.  (DOORBELL RINGS)  Aw, why we got to stay with your parents?  You know, sometimes I get the feeling  they don't respect me.  (GRUNTING)  (BRAKES HISS)  (WHIRRING)  Thank you for not interrupting my bit.  Come on in.  Wow, check out this media room.  Maybe you burning down the house wasn't so bad.  My actions were justified.  I'd been fed a massive societal lie  in the form of participant awards.  Hey, kids, how would you like to hear this on the screen  instead of the great show you came to see?  (CHILDREN CHEERING)  That's what you sound like. Honest.  Please cooperate and do your part  in keeping this theater quiet, so everyone,  including you, can enjoy it.  Remember, lots of adults and kids, too,  paid admission to enjoy the show.  We must insist on absolute quiet.  Otherwise, we will be forced to evict  all disturbance makers from the theater.  Those asked to leave today will be refused admission  to this theater in the future.  Thank you.  Wow, what a dick.  Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.  I've deleted all my old tweets,  so don't even bother looking for bad stuff.  Screen grabs can be faked.  But, first, it's that time of year again  for the annual Quahog Pie Cook-off.  The winner will take home the coveted Pie Champ trophy.  Brian, this could be my chance to finally win  a legitimate award.  - You think you're up to it? - Of course.  I just have to apply myself.  Like Chris, when he worked at that casino.  No more bets. The money that could have gone to your kids  is gone. No more bets.  The money you worked hard for is gone.  Fools, fools, fools.  Ooh, double zero. Nobody thinks about that one.  And guy walks quickly away from table without a word,  replaced by an older white man with a much younger black woman.  No more bets. No more bets.  Brian, are you ready for my grand creation?  - Serve it up, bitch. - Well, that was uncalled for.  But get ready to be wowed.  (CRUNCH)  What the This is mud.  Yes. It's a mud pie.  I used Legos for the fruit.  Stewie, you can't submit this. It's inedible.  Okay, now I know you're full of crap,  because everyone else loves it.  Mmm, num-num-num-num-nah.  So delicious, Stewie.  Best pie ever.  Wow! Tastes great, Stewie.  Mmm, so good.  Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.  Not so hammy, Meg. He's not an idiot.  Stewie, can't you see they're faking it  to make you feel good?  What are you talking about?  (SLO-MO): Wow!  Mmm. Num-num-num-num-nah.  So good.  We must insist on absolute quiet.  My God, you're right.  They're all just lying to protect my feelings.  This pie is garbage!  And the contest is next week. I have to drop out.  No, you don't. You just got to do the work.  Stewie, you're a smart kid.  I know you can bake a pie, and I'll help you.  You will? Thank you, Brian.  This calls for champagne.  Pop.  Glug, glug, glug.  Bottoms up.  Go with it.  Ugh. Korbel?  - It's not Korbel. It's - Go with it.  Yes, I had some left over from Denise's wedding.  - Who's Denise? - Go with it.  Fine. How is Denise? Did she have the abortion?  - Abortion? - Go with it.  No, her alarm didn't go off, so she missed it.  So, Brian, is this your first orgy?  Not going with it.  Peter, would you like to join us in a parlor game?  Parlor game?  Lois, why do you always start talking like a snob  when you're around your parents?  What? It's the way I was brought up.  I know, let's play ""The Minister's Cat.""  I don't know what that is.  It's simple. In alphabetical order. Go.  The minister's cat is an affable cat.  The minister's cat is a boisterous cat.  Penrose!  The minister's cat is a covetous cat.  The minister's cat is a devious cat.  The minister's cat's an eclectic cat.  Peter, your turn. Go.  - Wh-What? - Peter, hurry.  I don't I don't know this cat.  Damn it, Peter, you ruined the game!  Peter, perhaps the word you were looking for is  ""forgotten.""  Midnight   Not a sound from the pavement   Has the moon lost her memory?   She is smiling alone.   You kids are too young to remember that,  but your parents are gonna hate it.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  (SIGHS): Finally, a place to escape.  Oh, hey, Babs.  Hello, Peter. What brings you out here?  I had to get away from that stupid game.  I don't know, whenever I'm here, I feel out of place.  It's just a different world than I'm used to.  (BELCHES)  Bring that up again, and we'll vote on it.  Whoa, where'd you learn a line like that?  Oh, there's a lot you don't know about me.  You know, Peter, you and I are not so different.  You struggle to get erections, too?  You may think I've always been a part of this high-society world,  but I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth.  Well, that probably would've torn your mom's uterus.  My point is, I'm not from an upper-crust world, either.  I just had to act that way to impress Carter,  who cared about that stuff.  I was struggling to be something I wasn't.  In many ways, I still am.  There's an Ed Sheeran song  for every emotion you're feeling right now.  Ooh, no, thank you.  You know, I like hanging out with you.  Hey, what do you say we ditch this stuffy place  - and head to the Clam? - The Drunken Clam?  Why, I haven't been there in decades.  I'd love to.  - To the Babsmobile! - (ALARM CHIRPS)  (""BATMAN THEME"" PLAYING)  You got vehicles with your face on 'em, too?  You know it, stinky.  Oh, I didn't like being called stinky.  (TIRES SCREECH)  Babs, I got to hand it to you.  You turned a crappy night into something great.  You know, I've never dropped bowling balls  from an overpass before. They fall quick.  That was the most fun I've had in decades.  It felt good to reconnect with the girl I once was.  Hey, listen, you got to stay true to that girl.  She's an amazing person. A real person.  Not some stuffy Newport snob.  Oh, sometimes I feel trapped in this world,  forever trying to live up to everyone else's expectations,  especially Carter's.  Sounds like you've wasted your entire life.  Thank you, Peter.  You've helped me more than you know. Mwah.  Yuck.  Well, Brian, I've studied pie-making,  and the key is to find the absolute freshest ingredients.  Therefore, we must go wherever and whenever  they're to be found.  - Where are we? - 1666, England.  Home of Sir Isaac Newton  and one of history's most famous apples.  Which will be part of our pie.  (SHOUTS) Gravity never happened!  Good morning, family.  And before anyone asks, I brought this owl from home.  I did not take it from the enclosed owlery.  Just want to make that clear. Home-brought owl.  Peter, what did the two of you talk about last night?  - (HOOTS) - Yeah, who?  You can see why I stole this from the owlery  I-I mean brought it from home. Damn it!  My mother. After your night together,  she told Daddy she's leaving him.  - (HOOTS) - Yeah, who?  All right, I'm already getting tired of this owl.  I'm gonna go put him back in the owlery.  Peter, enough. You've got to make this right.  Now, that one seemed less earned.  (SEABIRDS CALLING)  (TIRES SCREECH)  Babs, I've been looking all over for you.  - What are you doing here? - This is my hometown, Peter.  It's where I grew up.  In fact, as a rebellious teen,  I used to come down to this boardwalk  and feed Alka-Seltzer tablets to the seagulls.  (SQUAWKING)  Babs, you got to come home. Carter needs you.  I'm sorry, but I-I can't do that right now.  (SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS)  Peter, you've been able to stay true to who you were.  - I've lost touch with that. - (SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS)  It's been buried by Carter and his money.  I want to find it again.  Listen, Babs, I understand what you're doing. I really do.  Sometimes I feel suffocated by Lois  and my stupid mother-in-law, but you got to come home.  - (SEAGULL SHRIEKS, POPS) - I don't think so, Peter.  You and Carter are meant for each other.  You go together.  L-Like the couple from the movie Grease.  Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama-Ka-Dinga- Da-Dinga-Dong, do you take  Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda- Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom  - to be your wife? - I do.  And Miss Shoo-Bop-Sha-Wadda- Wadda-Yippity-Boom-De-Boom,  do you take Mr. Rama-Lama-Lama- Ka-Dinga-Da-Dinga-Dong  - to be your husband? - I do.  If anyone objects to this union,  speak now or forever hold your peace.  (ALL GASPING)  Mr. Chang-Chang-Changity-Chang-Sha-Bop!  Peter, where have you been?  Listen, Carter, unless you want to lose Babs forever,  you better get down to Weekapaug.  Why the hell would I do that?  If you want to win her back,  maybe, for once, you try to fit into her world.  You got to become a regular guy.  What? No! Never!  Daddy, Peter's right. You got to do this for Mom.  All right, fine. I'll take a quick choke-myself-awake nap  and be ready to go.  (SNORING)  (CHOKING)  (CLEARS THROAT) All right. All right, let's go.  - I'm so nervous. - You made a damn good pie, Stewie.  You should be proud of yourself, whatever happens.  Good afternoon, Quahog, I'm Tom Tucker in a T-shirt?  And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.  This year's Quahog pie-baking champion is  Fjurg Vanderploeg.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  Everyone is welcome to taste my pie.  Sorry, Stewie. You did your best.  These were old pros.  But, hey, look. You took fifth.  Fifth? Is that good?  - Do I get a medal? - You get a ribbon.  Does everyone who participates get a ribbon?  Only ten out of 14.  My God. I did it.  No, Stewie, you did it  Oh, wait. Sorry, I thought you  - I thought you said ""we did it."" - I did not.  Good job, little boy.  Maybe someday you can come by my store  and have all the cake you want.  - Ooh, that sounds promising. - Okay, that's enough.  And maybe this winter, you can go fishing in my ice hole.  BRIAN: I said enough!  (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)  (MUSIC STOPS)    I think I went too big with the boots.  Buddy, I think you might be in the wrong place.  Yeah, you get lost on the wrong side of town, boot boy?  - (WHISPERING): Peter. - Just go with it.  It's all part of the ruse.  I say we take his pants down, see what he's working with.  And while we're at it, give me that pool cue.  I got an idea where we can put it.  - Peter, shut up. - Carter? Is that you?  Oh. Hey, Babs. I hang out here all the time.  Yeah. He comes in here with me.  And I'd even take a lie detector test to prove it.  Well, good thing the bar is having Lie Detector Wednesday.  Wh-What?  Just a few easy warm-up questions.  Have you ever had condomless sex with a man?  Okay, test over. Carter's never been here in his life.  Damn it, Peter. I'm leaving.  (CREAKING)  - (GASPING) - My truck!  Time to waste this fancy-pants.    (GRUNTS)  Babs, you saved me.  And the bartender's unconscious.  Let's take his pants down, see what he's working with.  (CHEERING)  (CRYING): Babs, I'm sorry.  I tried, but I can't do it.  I'll never be the real man you want me to be.  I'll always be just a spoiled, spineless, rich dandy.  Carter, I appreciate you trying to be the man I want,  but being back home here has made me realize  you already are.  What? I am?  I've discovered I'm not the same girl I once was.  I've changed.  I've grown accustomed to life with you.  I thought I wanted this life back,  but have you ever had a Milwaukee's Best?  It's an awful, awful, awful  - It's one of our sponsors. - Delicious beer,  but, still, ours is the life I want,  and you are the man I want.  Newport is my home now, and I'm ready to go back there.  Oh, Babs.  (MOANING)  Ah, old love.  (CREAKING)  Well, I didn't pay for my beer, but I left a hell of a tip.  (LAUGHTER)  Damn it, Griffin! You've been staring at that menu  for 22 minutes, and now you're sitting in a double pee puddle!  Peter, I'm so relieved  that my mother's back with my dad.  Yep. It all worked out.  Only one thing left to do.  Get drunk, go upstairs and weird out the kids.  (QUIETLY): Chris.  Are-are you awake?  Chris, you do you want a You want a Tom Brady kiss?  Chris, wake up.  I-I want to give my son a Tom Brady kiss.  (STEWIE CLEARS THROAT LOUDLY)"

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Welcome, everyone.  My name is Von Jiener,  and I'm Vice President of Creative Bankruptcy  for the Fox TV network,  which, at the time of this writing,  is still a thing that exists.  Just from looking at your clothes and weight,  I can tell you all watch a lot of free network television.  Am I right?  (LAUGHS) Excellent.  You have been selected to be part of a focus group  that could affect one of America's  most beloved television shows: Family Guy.  That woman looks exactly like me.  That's your reflection, Peter.  Oh.  I'm beautiful.  As you may or may not care,  Family Guy is in its 17th season.  And since Fox is now owned by Disney,  which will someday be owned by Netflix,  which will someday be owned by Pornhub,  we have decided that Family Guy is ready for a reboot.  Reboot? I thought they said it was a couple of tweaks.  Yeah, we're supposed to trust these idiots?  That woman has her finger up her nose.  That's still your reflection, Peter.  Oh. She's beautiful.  Now, as most unfunny women will tell you,  women are very funny.  That's why our first reboot is built around  the very popular Louise.  - LOIS: It's Lois. - Whatever. The mom.  - (UPBEAT SITCOM MUSIC PLAYING) - LOIS:  This is our time   This is our moment   This is a short song for syndication.   Lois!  Going to work, huh?  Yes, Joe, I'm going to work.  Great! More and more women are doing that.    (BICYCLE BELL RINGS)  Good morning, goddess.  You know, I just want to say again that you were  totally right last night to bring up  that thing I did wrong 11 years ago.  And please feel free to bring it up again anytime,  even if we're talking about something completely unrelated.  Thank you, Peter, I will.  (LAUGHS): Oh, I-I know you will.  - Morning, Lois. - Hey, girl.  Oh, hello, gay couple who's constantly jogging.  What are you up to this morning?  Just adopting and pucker-kissing.  Yeah, we're network TV gay,  so all we can do is adopt children  and pucker-kiss, no tongue stuff.  - Isn't that right, sweetie? - BOTH: Mwah!  Well, I'm off to my high-powered job  at a fashion magazine, greeting card company or winery.  I can't wait to see which.  LOIS: Oh, yay! It's a winery!  Good morning, Judy Greer.  Morning, Lois. How was your night last night?  Great. I worked out, made dinner,  a little family time,  and had Peter's ankles up in the air by 11:00.  God, I admire you.  That's what you're here for, Judy Greer.  (GASPS) Oh, I almost forgot.  Bert wants to see you in his office.  - Oh? What about? - He didn't say.  But it sounded hashtag serious.  Aw, meeting with the boss.  This is gonna be worse than finding a spider in the kitchen.  Oh, my God.  Peter, there's a spider in here!  Yeah, I know, genius.  Hi, Lois.  I wanted to let you know  I'm considering you for a big promotion.  Really? That's amazing.  (CHUCKLES): Well, the job's not yours yet.  It's between you and one other person,  Smarmy J. Tie-Straightener the Third.  I hit a gay jogger on my way to work today.    (TOILET FLUSHES)  Sorry I only satisfied you twice tonight.  I found a pouch of Big League Chew earlier,  and my jaw is worn out.  You did great, Peter.  Good night, perfect.  Aw, I just don't know what to do about this thing at work.  I Are we still talking about that?  I mean, it's fine if we are, w-we just  We talked about it before dinner  and-and during dinner and after dinner.  No, you're right. I'll be fine.  Good night, Peter.  (SIGHS): Oh.  I just want this promotion so bad.  Okay, so we are talking about it.  You know what? I'll make a vision board.  See my success and be my success.  My testosterone is so low I could not have thought of that.  Would you like me to put on our sleep ocean noises  with an occasional shocking seagull screech?  Yes, thanks. I have a big day tomorrow.  Good night.  (OCEAN WAVES SLOSHING)  (SEAGULL SCREECHES)  Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT)  May I have your attention, please?  Now, I know you're all wondering  who is going to get the big promotion,  and I'm proud to announce that person is Smarmy  Excuse me, where do I put this briefcase full of money?  Uh, who are you?  I'm president of Wine and Paint Night Incorporated.  Lois Griffin just landed my account  through her wit, charm and professionalism.  Is that so? Well, in that case,  the big promotion goes to Lois Griffin!  - (CHEERING) - (FANFARE PLAYING)  What can I say? I love my wife.  Eh, it's my show. Why shouldn't this be me?  'Cause I'm the funny one.  Not on this show you're not.  Or am I?  Ah, I thought we had one more face.  So, what did you think?  And please keep in mind that your spontaneous comments  will affect the jobs of hundreds of people.  Come on, you idiots, don't screw me.  The show is from a woman's perspective,  but it still felt like it was written by a man.  Okay, well, what if I told you shut up?  Yeah, kind of changes things, doesn't it?  Anyone else?  I'm sorry, I was scrolling through the weather  in random cities.  Great! You're taking this very seriously.  You know what, I don't really get Family Guy.  What's so hard to get?  You just need to have grown up in the '80s  but still be a teenager.  So, based on that one episode featuring Lois,  how many of you would likely watch a second?  LOIS: Son of a bitch!  Anything else?  Huh, 76 in Santa Fe right now.  Hey, what's going on in that room?  It's a focus group of Arby's executives  watching us eat.  - Oh! - No way!  - He ate it! - People will eat anything!  50 bucks says the fat girl eats  a third Big Beef 'n Cheddar. Who's on it?  - Okay. - I'll take that. -You got it.  - Oh, come on, buddy. - Don't do it.  Here she comes.  All right, kid, take your time.  - Yeah! - Gross! -Damn it!  Many recent shows have found success  by rebooting themselves as gritty supernatural teen dramas,  like Teen Wolf or Riverdale,  which are watched by as many as 6,000 people a year,  so we thought a similar approach might work for Family Guy.  I'm guessing we're wrong, but let's find out for sure.  (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)  FEMALE SINGER:  Ooh, ooh   Ooh, ooh   It's a show for teens   A sexy show for teens   Something's not normal   But what does normal mean   In a world that's on fire?     Hey, Goldman, great job with sports today.  Thanks, Chris. We're almost ready  for the important sports game.  - Hey, guys. - Hey, Ruth.  Good gender-fluid shower?  Great gender-fluid shower.  Dad, what are you doing here?  Putting my gender fluid in the shower.  Also, I'm the town sheriff,  but you don't find that out till later  because it's not relevant to the story.  Chris, there you are.  Patty, what's wrong? Why aren't you in bitch class?  It's your sister Meg.  She's dead.  (GASPS) I have to go.  Wait, where are you going?  I'm gonna go to a club I'm too young to get into  and listen to a band that's on a label  owned by the same parent company as the network.  Hey, who left their gender fluid in the shower?    (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  FEMALE SINGER:  Sexy rain   Sexy rain.   (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)  So, what can I get for you sexy teens?  Um, how's the vegetarian lasagne?  Terrible, even at the best restaurants.  We'll have five of those.  It just doesn't make sense. Who would want to kill Meg?  Um, can we all be quiet? (CHUCKLES)  We've been asked to nod our heads while the band plays  the song our parent company is aggressively marketing.  (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)  One of us is Richard Gere's kid   Ooh   One of us is Richard Gere's kid   Ooh   One of us is Richard Gere's kid.   I can't even with this.  I'm gonna go get some air and pebble-up my nipples.  (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)  (LOW GROWLING)  (SLOW, DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)  FEMALE SINGER:  Interior club   Moments later.   You guys, check it out. Patty just got into  the college for people with bright futures.  Oh, cool. Is she still gonna major in ""lot to live for""?  Yep. I think she's the one kid  who's gonna get out of this sexy town.  (PATTY SCREAMS OUTSIDE)  - Patty?! - I'll be right there.  I just have to drink a product- placement beverage first.  Peach Coke? Stop.  (HOWLING IN DISTANCE)  - Patty! - Where are you?  Patty, are you out here?  Patty?  Oh, I hope nothing happened  to the most disposable member of our cast.  Guys, look!  She's dead.  Boy, she she did stiffen up those nips, didn't she?  Y'all ready for your lasagnas?  - We're in the woods. - (HOWLING IN DISTANCE)  Guys, it's time to fire up our superpowers,  because we're also lesser-known Marvel characters.  - (WHOOSHING) - (FANFARE PLAYS)  And I'm your neighbor, who you didn't know  was also a superhero, Captain Pedantic.  Are you here to protect Zac and I?  Zac and me, but yeah.  (GROWLING)  (GUNSHOT)  Now is when you find out I'm the sheriff.  I'm laying  on a pinecone.  (EXHALES)  He means lying on a pinecone.  Now what happens?  Now one of us will become a breakout movie star  and leave the series, wrecking it for the rest of us.  Yay, it's me!  - Sir, what did you think? - Pass.  Okay. And how many of you would watch it  if the girls were wearing white shirts and black bras?  Peter, did you write the focus group questions?  What? Course not.  ""And if you're impressed by the size of  ""Alexander Skarsgard's penis,  that doesn't make you gay, right?""  - (POUNDING ON GLASS) - PETER: Answer him!  I know you've been here all day,  but it's not like you have jobs to go to,  so I'm going to show you one more reboot idea.  Which Wi-Fi should we be logging onto?  Glendale Galleria Public.  Yeah, that's what I've been trying.  Sometimes networks will cancel a show  only to reboot it with less-popular characters  from the original, while the more-popular actors go on  to find greater success in movies or ugly public divorces.  (FAMILY GUY THEME PLAYING)    On which we used to rely   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   He's a Fam ily Guy!   TRICIA TAKANAWA: Family Guy Again is filmed  before a live studio audience.  (PHONE RINGING)  CHRIS: I'll get it.  (AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)  Hello? Oh, hey there, Stewie.  Or should I say, ""G'day, mate,""  since you're in Queensland, Australia, where you moved  with Brian and Meg after Mom and Dad died?  (LAUGHTER)  Oh, married life is pretty good.  No, still no kids, but I've been practicing  - a lot by myself. - (LAUGHTER)  Masturbating, yes.  Between you and me, I think Tricia might be barren.  (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)  Uh, Stewie, I better go. Tricia's giving me that look.  (LAUGHTER)  Okay, give my love to Brian and Meg,  and hopefully we can come down there for the season finale.  No? You're just not gonna be a part of this at all?  Okay, then. Bye, Stewie.  Chris, I'm standing here in the living room  because I need to talk to you about something very important.  Look, we've been through this.  It's my house, and I want to wear shoes in it.  Chris, I offer you a choice.  You can either continue wearing shoes in the house  or continue having sex with this age-defying Eastern physique.  (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  Chris, I'm lying here listening to you toss and turn,  and wondering if there's something you'd like to discuss.  I don't know. It's just, it's been so hard  since Mom and Dad died  and Joe moved in with all his big band records.  (BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE)  Joe!  Chris, I'm lying here  asking you to kick Joe out of the house.  What? He was my dad's best friend for 20 years.  I can't do that.  Chris, I offer you a choice.  (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)  Luckily, I'm the town windower.  For me, every day is a pane.  (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)  FOCUS GROUP MEMBER: Can we please stop this?  Yes?  If I give you back my Diet Sprite, can I leave?  How did you feel about the show?  - I didn't like it. - Could you be more specific?  I just don't like the people or what they're saying or doing.  If you could sum up the show with one sound,  what would it be?  - ""Blech."" - For me, it was more like  the last squirt of a plastic mustard bottle.  (BOTTLE SQUIRTS)  Is that our mustard?  No. I always bring one with me in case the show is kind of  (BOTTLE SQUIRTS)  - Everybody, shut up! - Hey, it's that sheriff from The Q.  You people don't like anything.  Well, if you're all so smart,  what do you want to see in a Family Guy reboot?  Yes, unemployable neck tattoo guy.  It's a Bible verse.  Doesn't matter. Anything above the Adam's apple  means drugs.  I like Netflix. Could you be Netflix?  Yeah, Netflix is awesome.  Of course it's awesome; it's Netflix.  Look, we're stuck being Fox. We have to deal with it, okay?  - MAN: I watch Fox. - No, you don't. Nobody does.  Yeah, I like shows that are binge-worthy.  First of all, ""binge-worthy"" is not a word,  it's a marketing tool.  You've been brainwashed, sir. But fine.  We'll make Family Guy binge-worthy.  (DRAMATIC, PULSING MUSIC PLAYING)    (DARK, GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING)  (BLOWS)  (DRAMATIC ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)  See? Wasn't that terrible?  All right, we only have the room till 6:00, so what else?  - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - It's not 6:00 yet! What else?!  Young Sheldon is good. How about Young Family Guy?  How about I murder your whole family?  - What about BoJack Horseman? - Hard no.  - You'd get to be a horse. - Hard yes.  - Normal words, but a horse guy. - WOMAN: Can we please stop this?  You just asked for specifically that.  - (KNOCK ON DOOR) - It's not 6:00! What else?  - I like that Antiques Roadshow. - Fine.  And you're saying this is?  George Washington's poop. That's correct.  I have some news you might not like.  The poop is only two weeks old.  What? How can you be sure?  Well, for starters, there's a Skittle in it.  Ah, the general had a sweet tooth, huh?  Um, that was horrible.  Eh, I'm gonna tweeze the Skittle out  and go back in a week.  I like those Netflix stand-up specials.  Great. Matter of fact, we filmed one  back when I was an all-setup- no-punch-line comedian.  So, any of you out there have a futon?  - Yeah, yeah, right? - (CHATTER, DISHES CLINKING)  I Ubered here tonight.  (MAN COUGHING)  Man, Starbucks.  Facebook, huh?  And how about that new chip in credit cards?  Anybody ever been to Georgia?  The new iPhone is large.  (WOMAN COUGHING)  EDM music.  MAN 1: Boo! You stink!  MAN 2: Yeah! Dane Cook already did all these halves of jokes.  Hey, hey, this is my job.  I don't go down to Burger King.  That was terrible.  Netflix should make 800 more of those.  All right, what else? What else you guys want?  I like that thing James Corden does:  - Carpool Karaoke. - I can do that.  Hi. You having a good night? I did.  Just had a devil's three-way.  You know, me and two guys.  I think that's just gay sex. Why are you telling me all this?  Isn't this Taxicab Confessions?  No, this is Carpool Karaoke.  We're about to sing an Adele song.  Oh, that's gay.  Pull over by this hot guy and let me out.  I thought I read you guys were phasing out gay jokes.  That quote was taken out of context  and widely misunderstood.  All right, what's next, you sheep?  I like the Olympics. Can you guys be the Olympics?  Well, NBC hogs all the good sports,  so we'll get stuck with the boring ones  that the announcers always have to keep apologizing for.  PETER: Welcome back to pairs diving.  And once again, we are so sorry for this.  Brian, anything to add?  BRIAN: No, just our deepest condolences to a bored nation.  PETER: And we've got Lois down at the pool.  - Lois, anything? - No. Guys, just so sorry  that any of this is happening.  I-I mean, even once every four years  seems like just way too much.  BRIAN: And they're up in the air, and now they're in the water.  PETER: What is it again? A splash is bad?  BRIAN: Uh, yeah, I think so.  PETER: That's so stupid.  I'm sick of all the voices on your show.  - Can you change them up? - To who?  I like Jon Benjamin voices.  Can you all be Jon Benjamin voices?  - (ALL VOICED BY JON BENJAMIN): Hey, Joe. - Hey, Peter.  - Hey, Quagmire. - Hey, Cleveland. Giggity.  (NORMAL VOICE): What can I get for you fellas?  Nobody touches my voice.  (JON BENJAMIN'S VOICE): I liked all of that.  Um, except for the bartender.  Hey, guys, The Coffee Bean's Wi-Fi doesn't need a password.  Everyone, the reboot is off.  It turns out the executive who ordered it  was just a squirrel who snuck into the office.  - What? - Yes. But in fairness,  it was the same squirrel who green-lit Brooklyn Nine-Nine,  the show that challenged the notion  that only attractive people can be on television.  So, what does that mean?  It means Family Guy is just fine as it is.  (CHEERING)  Well, the Family Guy reboot is off.  What other ideas do we have?  (CHITTERING)  Brooklyn Nine-Ten?  It's possible this guy only has one idea.  (BOTTLE SQUIRTS)  You know what, I'm glad, after all that,  they let us keep the show the way it was.  Well, not exactly the way it was.  Hey, buddy, I brought over my big band records.  - They wanted more Joe. - They wanted more Joe.  (GLENN MILLER'S ""PENNSYLVANIA 6-5000"" PLAYING)    (PHONE RINGS)  JOE: Your show should have more Joe Swanson.    (PHONE RINGS)  JOE: Your show should have more Joe Swanson."

Methinks he found a new lady friend.  Don't say ""methinks"" ever again, Joe.  - Hey, there he is. - Hey, guys.  What-What's all this?  Oh, this little oogie-woogie is my new friend, Albertine.  Who thinks she's French.  She loves to smoke and feels it's not truly a meal  unless you serve bread.  (BABY VOICE): Isn't that right, Albertine?  You got to serve bread?  I don't believe she's ever said any of that.  So where have you been lo these many days?  Joe!  Well, you know how there's hardly any cat cafÃ©s in town?  Well, I decided to open a cat cafÃ©.  - What's a cat cafÃ©? - It's like a coffee shop,  except one where lots of cats live and roam.  Hmm, methinks the cat cafÃ© sounds like a great idea.  That's it, Joe! I challenge you to a duel!  Pistols at midnight.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  (GUNSHOT)  JOE: Peter, did you bring a flamethrower?  PETER: No.  I also didn't bring one of them laser guns from Ghostbusters.  Joe, look! Look!  I got Mayor West!  Good. We'll keep him till we get a new mayor.  Principal Shepherd, we were so surprised to get your call.  Wh-What's going on?  Mrs. Griffin, Meg and Chris were caught cheating.  - What? - Yes.  They had the Lost Boys of the Sudan  standing in for them in gym class.  Nice block, Griffin.  Nice shot, other Griffin.  This is terrible.  Uh, what do you think about this, Peter?  (SUDANESE ACCENT): Bad. Very bad.  (CATS MEOWING)  Here it is, guys! What do you think?  I'm realizing I may have a cat allergy.  I think it's great, Glenn.  And people really seem to be enjoying themselves.  Boy, if I could clean myself with my tongue,  I'd never leave the house.  (LAUGHING)  Right?  And it's like, if I had nine lives,  maybe I'd finally find a man.  (LAUGHING)  You's joining me.  - Peter, we have to talk. - What fireworks?  After what happened today with Meg and Chris at school,  I sent an e-mail to my sister, and five minutes later,  Google Ads suggested a Christian family camp.  Yeah, the world's better now that corporations read  our most private communications and then sell back at us  the very things they've eavesdropped about.  (FIREWORKS WHISTLING, POPPING)  Even before this, I'd worried about  our church attendance dropping off.  Now with the kids showing a complete lack of morals,  well, we may all need to go to Christian family camp.  Lois, you know I love you like a brother, but I'm not doing that.  I'd only get in an awkward, campfire-crackle argument  with a counselor.  Jesus has love for everyone.  Uh, actually, what Jesus has  is the might of Western civilization.  Jesus has guns, germs and steel.  (FIRE CRACKLING)  Sorry, the wood is very wet.  Uh, actually, the wood is very dry.  Wet wood hisses, dry wood crackles  during uncomfortable silence.  (FIRE CRACKLING)  I like cutaways where I get to be smart.  (CATS MEWING)  What the what the hell is that?  (GASPS)  (CATS HISSING)  Hey! Shut up! (BLEEP)  Don't look at me! I'm dominant!  Brian? What are you doing here?  What am I doing here? What is all this?  I happen to own this place. It's a cat cafÃ©.  Now get out of here. You're making all my cats angry.  That's why they're hissing.  Actually, frightened cats hiss.  Angry cats moan.  (FIRE CRACKLING)  You can't open this place here.  It's right next to my favorite bar.  Go to hell, Brian. You don't own this block.  I'm not going anywhere.  Fine. But I am about to become your worst nightmare.  No way. I've already had my worst nightmare.  I've told you about my worst nightmare, right?  - No, I-I don't think so. - Oh, boy, get comfortable.  Well, first, I'm driving through a forest,  but it's actually inside, which is weird, right?  - Okay. - And there's all these people  in the van who normally wouldn't know each other in real life:  my second grade teacher, my mom, Joe, but it wasn't quite Joe.  All the kids are yelling at me in German,  and I understood them, but I don't speak German.  Then SNL is starting, and I'm clearly in the cast,  and I haven't been to any of the rehearsals,  and all the cue cards are blank, and that show is all cue cards.  And just as that's sinking in,  I realize I'm also the musical guest.  I mean, I can't pull that off.  Who do I think I am? Silverchair?  - And the weird thing is - Wait a minute.  Listening to other people's nightmares  is my worst nightmare!  (SHOUTS) Oh. Oh, thank God.  (EXHALES)  I got to shut down that cat place.  (HORN HONKS)  Okay, Peter, the kids and I are off to church camp.  Meg, Chris, the vans are here.  Wait a minute.  - You got any booze in that bag, mister? - No, sir.  Well, then, how you gonna make any friends at camp?  Here you go.  Now chug all this next to a lake, you little rascal.  BRIAN (AMPLIFIED): Shut down the cat cafÃ©!  It's a nuisance and a threat to public health!  (SIGHS) Oh, for God's sake.  City ordinance 321(C) states, ""Food or drink shall not  be prepared or consumed within 20 feet of fecal matter.""  - Damn it, Brian. - Also, Persian cats?  Let's call them what they are: Iranian cats.  This entire operation needs to be shut down.  And as long as Brian's got your attention,  is it taking anyone else longer to wipe?  More wipes these days?  I'm taking shorter poops but with longer wipes,  and there's always this one little line.  I swear to God, it's like there's a crayon down there.  Wait, excuse me for a minute.  Son of a gun, it was a crayon.  Thanks for letting me talk that out, everybody.  (AMPLIFIED): Wikipedia states that  ""Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease spread by exposure  to infected cat feces.""  Damn it, Brian, get out of here.  You're scaring away my customers.  They also ring you up on one of those tablets  they flip around at you and then glare  while you pick from three inflated tip percentages.  You can also choose ""no tip.""  But that option is, by design, much less prominent.  You're a jerk.  But fine, if it's a fight you want, you got one.  I will squash you like a bug.  Well, that's enough of that show.  But, Dad, we want to see what happens at Christian camp.  All right. But they're on thin ice.  (LIVELY CHATTER)  Welcome to Sunrise Woods Bible Camp.  I'm the camp director Vera.  Nice to meet you. We're the Griffins.  Why are all these trees bunched together?  Th-Those are woods, Chris.  I only like rooms.  What a lovely setting.  Yes, the fresh air really helps  clear your mind of thoughts of Tom Selleck.  Oh. How frighteningly specific.  Ugh, Mom, this place sucks.  It's even worse than when Dad sent us to 1940s comedy school.  Say, Corporal, what are you writing in your diary?  It's private. Take a look.  Now, that's some good, clean fun.  Also in the 1940s, six million Jews died.  That's it, we're done.  This show is not for the Bugsteins.  Good evening. Quite a battle brewing  Clever news pun, doesn't really work as I haven't yet mentioned  the subject of the story At Quahog's new cat cafÃ©.  Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa filed this report.  Tom, I'm standing here outside of Quahog's new cat cafÃ©.  Local resident Brian Griffin has described the cafÃ©  as a threat to public health.  That's right, Tricia. And since I'm on local TV,  (LOUDER): I'm gonna talk a little too loud,  and then occasionally I'm gonna turn away  (QUIETER): from the microphone to point at things off-camera,  (LOUDER): so my overall point is lost.  Powerful claims. Thank you, Brian.  Okay, Brian, I brought everything we need:  water, sunscreen, (QUIETLY): Fruit Roll-Ups,  - batteries. - Stewie,  you know you're not allowed to have Fruit Roll-Ups.  Damn, I tried to bury it in there.  What are you even wearing?  Oh, this is what Princess Diana wore to protest land mines.  It's sad she's not around to watch her son go bald.  Brian, I'm glad you're here.  Based on the various public health concerns you raised,  the city has decided to shut this establishment down.  Really? You're closing the cafÃ©?  That's right. Thanks to you, I'm out of business.  I certainly hope you're happ Oh, nice top, Stewie.  Come on, lock it up.  Until the Board of Health gives the okay, you're done.  Wow, I actually got the place shut down.  I'm glad I was here for this, Brian.  We've hardly done anything together since we made  that fiber commercial and had to use code words for pooping.  Wow, Brian, I've never felt so regular.  Yes, you seem exceptionally active while maintaining  - proper body health. - That's right.  Just two spoonfuls a day to stay regular and active.  - More coffee, Stewie? - Yes, please.  Oh, dear, that was a mistake.  (STAMMERS) You mean, you're about to be active?  Currently active.  Cut to the shot of them stirring the product into water!  ANNOUNCER: GurgleMax: Take a massive comfort.  (STEWIE GROANING)  Oh, God!  Oh, there's regular on the carpet!  Ah, there's so much regular!  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  How are those drawings of Jesus coming?  Okay, a little dark on the hair there.  Let's lighten it up. Lighten it up.  Eyes should be blue.  Remember, history says that Jesus does not look like  a traditional man from the Middle East,  but rather someone who sells raw milk online.  Okay, let's put those away for now.  I'd like to move on to having you all  sign your contracts with God.  Contracts with God?  Yep. It's a written commitment to forgo all alcohol,  drugs and self-pleasure.  Yeah, I'm gonna have my lawyer look at this.  I tell you, it's a good day, Stewie.  Now that that cat cafÃ© is gone, I can finally get back  to my favorite bar and do some writing.  Whoa, sorry. Can't let you in there.  What? I come in here all the time.  Well, apparently, due to some recent public health concerns,  the city has said that no animals of any kind are allowed  in any public establishment.  What?! You got to be kidding me!  Well, that's all right, Brian. We can go to my writing spot.  - Brian! Look at my jump! - (KIDS LAUGHING)  Look at my jump! Look at my jump!  Whoa!  This place has the best pizza and Pepsi, Brian.  Did you hear me? The best pizza and Pepsi.  Oh, no, my pizza and Pepsi!  - Oh, hey, Peter. Come on in. - (CATS MEOWING)  Thanks for coming by.  Aw, no problem, buddy. Here, I brought you something.  I figured anyone living alone with 73 cats  needs to have a double-XL Minnie Mouse sweatshirt.  Thank you so much.  This won't fit at all; it's perfect.  So, how's it going?  Well, not bad. Got plenty of company.  Well, that's good. I haven't seen you at the Clam.  Well, I've been pretty busy.  So, can I get you something to drink?  Sure. What have you got?  Well, I've got water with cat hair in it.  Eh, anything else?  I've got lemonade with cat hair in it.  Uh, kind of a summer drink. Anything else?  Oh, sure. Cat hair ginger ale?  - Nope. - Cat hair iced tea?  Uh, again, summer.  You want to just take a look in the fridge, see what I got?  - PETER: Sure. - (CATS MEOWING)  Someone just had kittens in my mouth.  What's up? What are you doing?  Nothing. I'm just sitting here, trying to figure out  why we have stupid purple couches.  Have you ever known anyone in your life  to own a purple couch?  I would assume Steve Harvey.  That actually sounds right, but-but what is this?  A picture of a mountain?!  When have we ever been to a mountain?!  - What mountain even is it? - That's Mount Quahog.  Yeah I don't know, feels made up.  Brian, is this all because you haven't been able  - to get a drink? - I haven't been able to go anywhere.  No dogs allowed in public places.  Yes, I was thinking about that.  What if there was a way for you to go out?  ""Emotional support animal""?  Wear this, every place will have to let you in.  - So long as I'm with you. - Where'd you even get that thing?  The letters are iron-on.  The vest is from when I worked at Office Depot.  One pen? You're buying one pen?  Yep.  You don't work in an office you can steal this from?  I work from home.  - Ugh. - (BEEPING)  ANNOUNCER: Office Depot. We're coming, Blockbuster.  Mom, we don't really have to get baptized, do we?  No, Meg, just hang towards the back of the line.  - CHRIS: Good plan. - Chris, stop relieving yourself.  You've got those pee eyes.  (SIGHING)  Brother Chris.  Do it again.  - Sister Lois? - Oh, no, thanks.  Y-You'd have no way of knowing this,  but I'm actually having a very good hair day.  When my hair gets wet, I tend to look like  a frazzled Sandra Bullock from one of her comedies.  My ex-husband had Nazi paraphernalia and he left me.  So I said, ""That shirt looks really good on you,""  and he says, ""Thanks, my boyfriend got it for me.""  It's like, whoa, all I said was I like the shirt,  and he has to drop ""boyfriend"" like a nuclear bomb?  - I mean, that's on him, right? - Yeah. I don't know.  Ugh, you're supposed to be giving me emotional support right now.  Let's just get to the bar.  No, no, Brian, say something nice about me right now.  Come on, Stewie, that's not what this is.  It is now. Say something nice about me  or I'll disappear like a serial killer in a '90s movie.  Stewie, wait. I need you to get in.  I'm gonna do it.  (SINISTER MUSIC PLAYING)  - (MEOWING) - Okay, who's ready for some breakf?  Oh, crap, another one died. Hey, hey, stop eating her!  Get away! Okay, new house rule.  Everyone look at me. Don't eat the dead cats.  Oh. Hey, Quagmire.  We came to see how it's going.  Uh, ""how's it going""? I got a dead cat on a pitchfork!  I don't even know which can to put it in!  Trash?! Yard trimmings?! Recycling?!  I just put whatever in whatever.  JOE: Hey, guys! Check it out!  Cat legs! Cats, arise.  Guys! It's working!  - (DOG BARKS) - (CATS MEOWING)  I'm not dead!  Okay, we're getting out of this place tonight.  Everyone clear on the plan?  CHRIS: Yep. Meg and I switch faces  - like in the movie Face/Off? - No.  Oh. Then we have an issue.  I told you we should ask Mom first.  Why would you think that?  Ugh Just, you two follow my lead.  You know, Vera, I've been so moved by my time here  at camp, I wonder if I could perhaps say grace tonight?  Oh, that'd be lovely, Lois.  Well, I'd like to begin with a moment of silence.  A fully counted-out, Mississippi, 60-second  moment of silence.  And the first one to open their eyes is gay.  - (SIGHS) - MALE VOICE: Psst. Up here.  My eyes are open, too.  There was something in the air that night   The stars were bright, Fernando   They were shinin' there for you and me   For liberty, Fernando   Though we never thought that we could lose   There's no regret.   (OWL HOOTS)  Ugh. Good riddance, Christian family camp.  Totally. I will say, though,  it seemed like Chris enjoyed himself there.  Well, Meg, you know Chris is (QUIETLY): a little bit dumb,  and I know you're not particularly popular  or beautiful, but you do have a head on your shoulders.  So religion isn't gonna be for people like you and me.  It's basically for (QUIETLY): stupid people like Chris.  So to summarize, religion for you and me?  No good. But for (QUIETLY): idiots like Chris?  - Perfect. - What are you guys talking about?  - How handsome you are. - Really?  Swear to God.  You're a monster.  (CRICKETS CHIRPING)  (MUTTERS) Stupid law. Banning dogs.  Kibbles and bits and bits and bits.  You! You son of a bitch! This is all your fault!  - What the? - Ha-ha!  (BOTH GRUNTING)  (CAR HORN HONKS)  You thirsty, boy? Yeah, you're a thirsty boy.  - Wait a minute, we're fighting! - (GRUNTS)  Aah!  And now, time to make my getaway.  Brian, oh, my God! Are you all right?  Here, let me mend you, like in a 1990s action movie.  Aw, thanks. That is better.  Look at us. What are we doing?  (SIGHS) I don't even know anymore.  You know what?  I'm sorry I destroyed your dream, Quagmire.  I know you loved that cafÃ©.  Wow. Um thanks, Brian.  Why did you open that place, anyway?  Well honestly, I just thought  that maybe I could put something good in the world for a change.  What do you mean?  I mean that uh  I've always been about sex and seducing women,  but you know what?  Someday I'm gonna be dead.  And, I-I mean, is that my legacy?  I just thought if I created something  that makes people happy,  maybe people would remember me for that.  You probably think that's stupid.  Quagmire I'm here for you.  For emotional support.  Thanks, Brian. What do you say?  You want to go for a walk?  I always want to go for a walk.  Hey, does anyone know what's going on with my brown crayon?  Because it disappeared from the box for a while,  and now it's back.  It's a little I don't know, oily and misshapen?  I'm not a crayon scientist,  but it looks like it's seen some heat.  The city repealed a law prohibiting animals  from public businesses today.  And finally, tonight  We built this city!   There. Now it's in your head, too.  Well, I'm glad you get to go out in public again, Brian.  I'm glad you, Chris, and Meg are back from that Christian camp.  Hey, where is Meg, anyway?  Oh, she was so mad I dragged her to Christian camp,  she ran away to live with a Japanese family.  (JAPANESE-STYLE MUSIC PLAYING)  Damare, Meg!  - (FARTS) - (SCREAMS)  (OTHERS LAUGHING)  Family Guy over! On-uh Foxuuu!"
Family Guy s18e06 Episode Script            ,"


                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Good evening, Quahog. Our top story:  a local Yankee fan's dream comes true  when he's diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.  But first  Hey, the TV went out.  OTHERS: Huh.  Oh, my God, the Wi-Fi is out.  (SCREAMING, SHOUTING)  (GRUNTING)  Okay, everyone calm down.  I know how we'll get through this.  This is the story of the greatest trilogy ever told,  The Mighty Ducks.  It was a time of great nonsense.  Dad, why don't you tell us how you and Mom  fell in love and got married?  And in go the earbuds.  Terrific episode idea, Meg.  Well, it was the 1990s,  the decade of Viagra but also Lorena Bobbitt,  so it was kind of a yay-boo period for penises.  After graduating, your mom and me moved to the city  with all our friends.  (90S-STYLE SITCOM THEME PLAYING)  (FOUR CLAPS)  I lived with my best friends, Quagmire and Cleveland.  We were the kind of friends who were all good-looking,  except for David Schwimmer.  And your mom lived across the hall  with her friends Bonnie and  uh, Bonnie.  God, we desperately need to get  more female characters in this show.  I was the Chandler.  Not because of my sarcastic zingers  but because I liked to take 40 Vicodin a day.  Guys, I've got big news.  Tell 'em, Quagmire.  I got a promotion at Blockbuster!  - (GASPING) - (CLAPPING FOUR TIMES)  Gleonard Quagmire, that is fantastic news!  I know, right? You know how I always felt  like I was stuck in second gear?  Well, this is a new gear!  Well, congratulations, Glenn!  This calls for a fountain dance.  (90S-STYLE SITCOM THEME PLAYING)  PETER: I was the least graceful at fountain dancing.  I just swung my arms and tried to fit in.  It was senseless. We were in our clothes,  for God's sake. Everyone got wet.  It was cold. You know,  there were originally nine friends,  but three of 'em died of pneumonia.  I'm still haunted by Chad's shivering last words,  ""Don't let Monica get Botox.""    We also hung out at our favorite cafÃ©, Perk Place,  where we would all sweat like crazy  'cause everyone in the '90s wore turtlenecks,  vests, and Jamiroquai hats.  Lois, you look down. What's wrong?  Brad Pitt broke up with me in a pretty public way.  I just don't know if I'll ever date again.  Wait, I thought you and Dad dated in high school.  Did you break up?  Uh-uh, story's not over, Meg. Settle down.  Your father and I had dated for a few years,  but I didn't know if it was going anywhere.  So we decided to take a break but remained close friends.  I actually briefly dated one of our roommates, Barry.  He was one of them what the fountain took.  My father had planned out my whole life for me.  He wanted me to marry one of Quahog's up-and-comers,  Tom Tucker, Elmer Hartman,  Seamus or Billy Zane.  It's meeting the man of my dreams   And then meeting his beautiful wife   And isn't it ironic   Don't you think?   It's like rain   On your wedding day.   Alanis Morissette was America's sweetheart in the '90s.  She went on to become one of the CDs in the garage.  CHRIS: Wait, Seamus had arms and legs?  LOIS: Chris, I'm not sure you have the green light  to just chime in whenever.  Lois, let's go take a midnight swim at Sharkbite Cove.  Oh, sounds wonderful, Seamus,  but I have other plans.  Okay, well, I'm definitely going.    Peter, why don't you admit it?  You still got the hots for Lois.  It's obvious.  Nah, we're broken up. We're just friends now.  (FOUR CLAPS)  Looking back, I realize he was right.  But the '90s was an exciting time,  and we wanted to experience all it had to offer.  Hey, guys, there's a great concert  in World Trade Center Plaza this weekend!  Really? Who's playing?  They got Korn, Cranberries and Cake.  Oh, that sounds delicious. But who are the bands?  They're opening with Cake.  Wait, shouldn't cake be last? It's a dessert.  Korn is last. Korn is a bigger draw than Cake.  Corn is not a bigger draw than cake.  - Cake is delicious. - ""No Doubt""?  Well, I'm glad you agree with me, Quagmire,  but that still doesn't address this issue of the order.  My last show was a Weezer concert.  Well, that's 'cause everyone smokes nowadays.  What band did we see last time at the Palladium?  It was, uh, Blur.  Yeah, I can't remember, either.  It was a very confusing time in music.  Okay, time for another scene.  Let's transition with a '90s guitar sting  that's way too long.  (90S-STYLE SITCOM THEME PLAYING)  (FOUR CLAPS)    (FOUR CLAPS)  - CHRIS: Dad, what - PETER: H-Hang on, Chris.  It's not done yet.    (MUSIC ENDS)  Okay, there we go.  CHRIS: What'd you do for a living, Dad?  PETER: What any of us did never really mattered.  It was just ""vague business.""  But despite having broken up,  I would sometimes sneak away to the Internet  to go flirt with your mom.  Well, I'm gonna go move my bangs with my pinky  in front of the mirror.  - AOL GUY: Welcome! - PETER: Shh, shh, shh, shh!  - You've got mail! - Okay, good, but quiet.  You've got male porn!  Shh, shh, shh!  Peter, quit trying to flirt with that clearly girlfriend of yours  and come watch giant box TV with us!  PETER: We all watched The X-Files,  which would be Fox's last hit show.  And it was the heyday of the multi-camera sitcom,  and Paul Reiser, its king,  was must-see.  Perhaps I'll try this yogurt.  That's been in there since our wedding.  (GROANS) Perhaps I won't.  (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER)  Peter, admit it.  You're still in love with Lois.  Yeah, every time you see her, you go, ""Schwing!""  Which is, like, the sound  of being lifted by a boner, I think.  Yeah, but we decided we wanted to see other people.  That's only 'cause she got tired of waiting around for you.  Look, she loves you,  but she ain't gonna wait around forever.  I knew they were right.  Your mom was the only one  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  So I saved my money, and, a few months later,  I bought a ring.  So, did you enjoy your pesto with pesto?  Does this smile give you your answer?  Lois, there's something I want to ask you.  Will you marry me?  Oh, Peter, I'm-I'm so sorry, but  I'm already engaged to Tom Tucker.  Passed over for Tom Tucker?  That's terrible.  What do you think of that, fellow '90s star Joey Lawrence?  - Meh. - Oh. Huh.  Okay, well, what would you think if I told you  that Blossom would completely drop out of show business  to get a PhD in neuroscience  and then come back and make $15 million a year,  while you would work steadily for 20 years,  lose all your hair and go bankrupt?  - Whoa! - (CHUCKLES): There it is!  Yeah, that's the That's the thing I wanted.  Where's Dad?  AOL GUY: You've got male porn!  Peter, get in here and finish the story!  Sorry, I was just watching some guy take it in the AOL.  - Goodbye. - All right, where were we?  Mom just said she got engaged to Tom Tucker?  Well, deep down, I knew I loved your father,  but I guess I just caved to my father's pressure.  And on my 28th birthday,  he introduced me to my future husband.  (TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING)  (MUSIC ENDS)  (HIGH-PITCHED):  He's your king-to-be   A king to be forever   A king who'll do whatever   Her Highness   Desires   He's your king-to-be   Thanks, Ollie.  Good afternoon, Lois. I'm Tom Tucker,  your king-to-be.  In other news,  President Clinton sent me a congratulatory cigar,  but it's a little moist.  PETER: Well, I wasn't gonna give up that easily.  So I decided I was gonna do the most powerful thing  you could do in the '90s: make a mixtape.  Again, Peter, it's your mixtape,  but you've got ""Cotton Eye Joe"" as song number two,  number four, seven and eight.  You think it should be number three as well?  No!  I made it number three as well.  Oh, Peter, I got to say,  the fourth and fifth time I heard ""Cotton Eye Joe,""  it really got to me.  LOIS: I was so happy.  I knew Peter was the one  I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  But I dreaded having to tell my father.  Luckily, he was remarkably understanding about it.  I've decided to be remarkably understanding about this.  - Really? - Yes. And to prove it,  I'm going to pay for Peter's bachelor party  at the MTV Beach House.  And I promise it's not part of a ruse  to destroy your affection for Peter once and for all.  Oh, Daddy, thank you!  PETER: I was thrilled.  Not only was Carter letting me marry Lois,  but this was gonna be the ultimate bachelor party.  The MTV Beach House was located  in the most hepatitis-rich part of Florida,  known as Florida.  Whassup?!  (CHUCKLES) Commercials.  No skipping those yet.  We partied the same way everyone in the '90s did,  spaced apart by a few feet,  dancing on our own.  JOE: Yeah, I was pretty much the coolest guy there.  With the best legs.  There were these other idiots there having a bachelor party,  but I didn't know 'em. They were losers.  - PETER: Joe? - JOE: Who's that? Peter?  PETER: Yeah, get out of my story. What the hell are you doing?  JOE: I'm telling the story of my days at the MTV Beach House.  You get out of my story!  I'm about to tell how I met Daria.  So, you partying hard or hardly partying?  Hardly interested.  You're mean!  (DARIA THEME PLAYING)  La-la-la-la-la   La-la-la-la-la.   PETER: I even got to meet my heroes,  Mark McGrath, Pauly Shore and Jamie Kennedy,  and we became friends.  Guys, come be in my wedding.  Then we can all enter the 2000s together as friends.  Sorry, Peter, but we can't go with you.  We're not allowed in the 2000s.  Yeah, we have to stay back here in the '90s.  - Goodbye, Peter. - PETER: And then,  they all walked into the sea and disappeared forever.  Tell the world about us!  PETER: I planned to,  but then I found a half-eaten hot dog  that only had a little bit of sand on it.  And most of the sand was very brushable.  You can pretty much wash a hot dog with soap and water,  and you can still eat it.  I danced for eight hours straight on The Grind,  occasionally going into the pool to pee.  Also, for some reason, I was the only guy  - a bee was following the whole time. - (BUZZING)  Maybe it was 'cause of the Country Time Lemonade powder  I'd been eating, or 'cause me and Quagmire  were huckin' Capri Suns at each other.  But little did I know, while I was dancing  and periodically peeing in the pool,  Carter was orchestrating a plan  to destroy my relationship with your mom once and for all.  Hey, you're Daisy Fuentes.  Oh, that's how I say my last name.  You're the hottest girl of 1990-this.  I've got a proposition for you.  (WHISPERING)  Hey, there. You're all that and a bag of chips.  What a cool phrase.  I hope it never sounds dumb and dated.  (BOTH GRUNT)  (CROWD CHEERING, WHISTLING)  (DAISY GRUNTING)  Look, Peter's wrestling with Daisy Foo-en-taze!  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  (BOTH GRUNTING)  (DAISY GRUNTS)  PETER: It all happened so fast.  Oh. We're having fun 'cause it's not 9/11 yet. Mmm.  PETER: But the next thing I knew,  I was kissing Daisy Fuentes.  And it was on national television.  LOIS: I was home doing what girls did at the time  Looking at pictures of John Elway.  (SIGHS) My horse-toothed dreamboat.  Denver looks beautiful.  (GASPS) Peter?! How could you?!  LOIS: My heart shattered the moment I saw it.  I took your father's mixtape and hucked it into the ocean.  Right then and there, I vowed I would never see him again.  (LAUGHS)  She said ""wood.""  (LAUGHS)  That was cool.  Yeah. Wood! Wood!  You're right! Wood.  (LAUGHTER)  (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)  (LAUGHTER)  Daddy, tell us more about the black '90s.  Well, Magic Johnson got AIDS, and I was like, ""What?!""  But then, he came back the next season and scored 30 points  in a game where no one would touch him.  And he caught it through heterosexual sex contact?  Well, that is magic.  (LAUGHS) Terrific. Thank you, Cleveland.  And thank you to the entire Brown family,  whose last name escapes me at the moment.  (LAUGHS) Terrific.  Thanks, Dad.  Now back to your story.  I had just lost the love of my life.  So as a way to forget my pain,  I threw myself into a dot-com startup with Quagmire.  We were two ambitious young entrepreneurs  at the height of the dot-com bubble.  Oogle? Goo goo?  Gah-gah goo? Gee-gee goo? Go go go?  Keep saying baby words, Peter. You're onto something.  We're close. We're circling it!  Goo-goo gah-gah? Oo oogle? Ooh eee ooh ah ah?  Moments late, we'd found a business idea destined  to change the tech world forever: Googoogle.  A search engine for all the info on the Goo Goo Dolls.  People are always gonna need information about them!  PETER: We were on our way.  We rented office space,  and watching it gave us the idea to rent office space.  (LAUGHS) Lumbergh.  (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)  Uh, clearly, we hadn't discussed the, uh,  tone of our work environment.  I should say we haven't.  I thought this was to be a place of business.  We got over our initial differences,  and then spent the rest of the day doing  what everybody did in the '90s  Debating what was better Forrest Gump or Pulp Fiction.  Forrest Gump is ridiculous!  One guy does what he's told all the time and makes millions.  But a girl goes off, tries to be different, gets AIDS, and dies!  I find your argument shallow and pedantic.  I didn't see either one.  I saw Ace Ventura 50 times.  Laughed so hard, I crapped myself in the theater.  Just thinking about it now makes me  (LAUGHS)  - (LOUD FLATULENCE) - Ow!  LOIS: Meanwhile, my wedding plans  with Tom Tucker were back on.  Are you ready? I can't believe  the wedding is just two scenes away.  What's wrong, sweetie?  I guess I'm just not sure if I'm doing the right thing.  What if this is a mistake?  Trust me, you're doing the right thing. It's gonna be great.  Now, listen, we don't have too much time before the wedding,  so I want to go over something  regarding the father-daughter dance.  It goes, ""Dallah-hollah wallah-ballah-dallah Macarena,  wakka-lakka-chakka-hakka-bakka Macarena.""  Daddy, I don't think  ""The Macarena"" is the best father-daughter dance.  Well, how about another song from the '90s?  Casey would waltz with the strawberry blonde   And the band played on   What? Wrong '90s?    PETER: Like everything stupid  in the '90s, Googoogle took off.  We celebrated in grand dot-com bubble fashion:  by having an outrageous yacht party  with lobster fights and hookers.  We did Ecstasy, which was terrible for you,  and only ever made me feel fantastic.  Kids, don't do it. It's too awesome.  They said it would burn a hole in your brain,  - but show me the hole. - LOIS: Peter, that's enough.  PETER: If you hate pure, unconditional love  and experiencing the profound harmony of the universe,  definitely do not try this drug.  There's also, like, a 90% chance you'll hook up,  but really, no, don't do it.  Even if you don't hook up, you don't care.  But you'll hook up, guaranteed.  LOIS: Okay, Peter, let's move on.  CHRIS: And what was the name of that drug?  PETER: But despite our success,  something was missing.  Peter, we did it!  What's the matter? You still sad about Brandon Lee?  Yeah. I never heard of him before he died,  but when he died, it was so sad.  But also, it's Lois.  She's getting married tomorrow.  Somehow, all this success feels meaningless,  knowing I'm about to lose her forever.  Peter, then you need to stop that wedding  before it's too late.  But we've got a business to run.  You don't care about this business.  All you've ever cared about is Lois.  This is your last shot.  Peter, you get to that wedding.  PETER: They were right.  So I decided to get there  the way everyone got around in the '90s  Propelled by an explosion.  (LOUD EXPLOSION)  (ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING)  Do you, Lois Commondenominator Pewterschmidt,  accept this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?  (ALL GASPING)  Peter? What the hell are you doing here?!  Lois, can I talk to you privately?  (LOUD EXPLOSION)  What is it, Peter?  Before you marry Tom, what's the Mortal Kombat blood code?  I keep forgetting.  It's ""A-B-A-C-A-B-B,"" but you can't do this now!  You're ruining my wedding!  Lois, if I didn't come here,  I'd regret it for the rest of my life.  I know I screwed up, and I don't deserve you,  but I can't stop thinking about you, day and night.  It's been this way since the day we met.  I fell in love with you then, and I'll never stop.  Unless Daisy Fuentes felt something?  DAISY: Uh, I didn't.  Lois, you're the only woman for me.  He cheated on you!  No daughter of mine is going to marry a cheater!  Daddy's right.  Peter, I'm sorry, but you blew it.  I was in love with you, too, but then you cheated on me.  You kissed Daisy Fuentes.  Lois, there's something you should know.  He didn't kiss me. I kissed him.  Because you felt something?  Because Carter paid me.  Well, that's something!  Daddy is that true?  I only did it to protect you from making a huge mistake!  Lois, I may not be as smart or as handsome  as the guys your dad wants for you,  but I love you more than all of 'em put together.  That's a fact. Just as sure  as the Star Wars movies are a perfect isolated trilogy,  unmarred by additional canon.  Oh, Peter!  (ORGAN PLAYS ""WEDDING MARCH"")  - Damn it, stop them! - PETER: One by one,  members of Lois' family tried to stop me, but I laid 'em out.  There's something about punching someone  - in a church that just feels good. - (YELLING)  (BELL TOLLING)  (LOUD EXPLOSION)  Cleveland picked us up in a white Bronco.  (TIRES SQUEALING)  Why did you have a white Bronco, Daddy?  I was driving my innocent friend O.J.  and his ex-wife's head down to Mexico.  PETER: We eloped at Fenway Park,  which I paid 50 grand to rent out  the day before the dot-com bubble burst.  I now pronounce this the last straight marriage.  - (BOTH MOANING) - PETER: And I think  I got swindled on the Fenway deal  because there was a game that night.  - (BAT CLACKS) - STADIUM ANNOUNCER: It's a hit!  No! That would have been the game-winning run!  The Red Sox lose.  ALL: Boo!  LOIS: I was having serious regrets  about my decision, but was already pregnant with Meg,  so there was no backing out.  ALL: Boo!  (BEE BUZZING)  This bee's chasing me! Somebody call Ace Ventura!  - (LAUGHS) - (LOUD FLATULENCE)  Ow!  (BOTH LAUGHING)  (ALL THREE LAUGHING)  Aw.  Wow, Mom and Dad. I feel like I learned so much tonight.  And not just about you guys, but also about the '90s.  Oh, there's a lot more to learn about the '90, Meg.  Like, for instance, are you familiar  with a band called ""Counting Crows""?  I think I might have heard them in a Starbucks.  Yes, you have.  Anyway, their lead singer is this thing called Adam Duritz.  He looks like if Marc Maron had sex with a scarecrow  and gave birth to a baby made of hemp.  I always thought he looked like the Cowardly Lion  in a suburban white high school production of The Wiz.  - That's not what that is? - No, Chris.  But actually, the joke's on us,  because this Sideshow Bob burnout slept  with a primo roster of '90s tail.  - Jennifer Aniston. - No.  - Courteney Cox. - What?!  - Winona Ryder. - That guy?!  Christina Applegate, Lara Flynn Boyle, Emmy Rossum.  Ooh, this is just making me angry.  - Mary-Louise Parker. - I hear she's difficult."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Oh, fun! Look, Peter.  Smash Mouth is playing here next weekend.  - In Quahog? - No, in this porn store.  - (SCANNER BEEPS) - Well, you caught us.  Lois and I are stocking up  for a very special anniversary evening,  and I'm not sure that five percent discount  was worth checking in here on Facebook.  (PHONE CHIMES)  Ew, Meg, don't ""like"" that.  Anyway, to celebrate, we thought it would be fun  to recount the three greatest love stories ever told.  We'll begin with the tale of Helen of Troy:  ""The face that launched a thousand ships.""  Which is the poetic way of saying,  ""Helen of Troy was thicc, tho.""  Which is the Black Twitter way of saying,  ""She was very attractive.""  (EXOTIC VOCALIZING)  The people of Troy's chocolate  has gotten into our peanut butter.  The people of Greece's peanut butter  has gotten all over our chocolate!  We could perhaps try the combined taste,  or we could fight to the death.  Guys, stop! The Battle of the Greece's Peanut Butter Cup  has gone on too long.  Let us agree to disagree.  Huh, what a pleasantly de-escalating phrase  that I'm just now hearing for the first time.  Yes, we will agree to disagree.  The war between the Greeks and the Trojans is over!  (CHEERING)  To Greece!  Now let's go call a bunch of jagged rocks a beach.  (PAINED GRUNTING)  - Ooh! Ow! - Sharp! Sharp! Sharp!  - Hot! - Hot!  Man, I'm happy the war is over.  I can't wait to get back to Troy.  Yeah, I'm just gonna plop down with my kids  and watch Troy Story.  To the other side of that hill and beyond!  That's as far as we know about right now.  You know what I just realized?  This. This could be a really long poem.  Now, if you'll excuse me, Helen's in my cabin,  and I thought I'd give heterosexual sex a try.  (DOOR CREAKS)  Helen?! What the Hades?!  What? She's hot.  But not as hot as Medusa.  Ah, one look at Medusa, and I'm rock hard.  Mythologically correct.  Coming up, Greek food voted burpiest in the world.  But first, in tragedy news:  your queen, Helen, has run off with Paris back to Troy.  This is an outrage!  I'll send my entire army after them, led by my best warriors!  Achilles, ACL, get in here!  (PAINED GRUNTING)  - What? - Helen has run off with Paris!  We're going to get her back and burn Troy to the ground.  Well, that sounds good.  I just need to cancel my lesson with Socrates first.  Isn't he that thinker they keep shuffling around  from one philosophy school district to the next?  No, no, he's the one  whose method is all about asking questions.  - Like what? - ""Have you ever tried wine?""  ""Can you keep a secret?""  ""You know this is your fault, right?""  Yeah, he'll he'll make you question a lot about yourself.    So, we'll sail directly east,  and then head north at a 90 degree angle.  It's the fastest possible way I can imagine getting there.  Hang on. Let me see that.  Pythagoras just invented this thing called a ""hypotenuse.""  If we know this distance and this distance,  we can calculate this more direct route.  Wow. Our people are, like, really smart.  I bet Greeks will always be known  for their advancements in math and not as cartoon characters  with very hairy arms and a tragically mismanaged economy.    Okay, I had a feeling this fortress would be impenetrable,  so I've hired the finest builder in Greece  to make us a giant wooden horse.  We'll hide inside it, they'll take it in as a gift,  and then we spring out and destroy the city.  I call it ""the Trojan horse.""  Well, that sounds great,  but there's another door right here that's just beads.  - What? - Yeah. Just beads. See?  Oh, boy, this  this is gonna be a difficult phone call.  Let's go! Let's go!  This needs to be done yesterday!  - (PHONE RINGING) - Hello?  Giant Horse Company, Pay On Delivery,  No Deposit Required. Can I help you?  What?!  (ALL YELLING)  (WIND WHISTLING)  Where the hell is everyone?  Well, they left a note.  It says Helen and Paris went back  to the Greek Isles to get married (GASPS)  And all three of Helen's fathers are going to be there?!  Dancing queen   They came!  Awesome! And now that we're owned by Disney,  we can have Hercules here.  No?  They-they won't let us use him?  What was the point of this whole merger?  Well, who can we use?  ""Launchpad McQuack""?  No. No. No, you know what? I'm exhausted.  I'm exhausted with being told ""no.""  And now I'm married. Ugh.  I'm gonna go break wieners off statues.  (""DANCING QUEEN"" PLAYS)  Welcome back. My credit card got declined at the sex store.  We ran off with only the stuff we could keister.  Our next love story is Romeo and Juliet,  a 500-year-old tale about horny preteens  that society somehow decided is classy and not perverted,  even though two middle schoolers bang in it. Enjoy.  Two households, both alike in dignity,  in fair Verona where we lay our scene.  Well, I'd say Verona's better than fair.  They's gettin' a Shake Shack this summer.  Ooh, milkshakes and crinkly fries.  Gonna have myself a pooch-belly if I's not careful.  I'm sorry, y'all.  I done chatterboxed my way through the whole prologue.  Boy, this is nice.  Will there ever be a more popular Italian city  - than Verona? - I don't know.  Are we even supposed to be at this party?  If they find out we're Montagues, they might razz us!  Relax. No one's gonna recognize us.  We got inch-wide masks over just our eyes,  with the rest of our faces plainly visible.  We're fine.  You wanted to see me, Daddy?  Juliet, honey, we need to talk.  You're a grown woman now,  and it's time for you to get married.  Grown woman?! Daddy, I'm 13.  Shh. Uh, don't say that. Tell people you're 11!  Do you want to get married or not?!  (SIGHS) Fine.  Now, I found you the most eligible bachelor  in all of Italy.  He's from the Boyardee family. Kind of a big deal.  My family makes the best canned sugar pastas in all the land.  Are you out of breath from saying one sentence?  Just give me a second.  I'm in the midst of a full-on, lockdown sodium headache.  I haven't peed for 36 hours.  Whew. Okay.  Now, fair Juliet, let our houses join together,  like beef and roni.    Ah, cool!  (CHUCKLES)  Shakespeare.  (EXHALES)  (SQUEAKING)  What what is that?  It says ""hole.""  I don't get it.  You wrote ""butt.""  Okay.  I'll I'll come over there.  (GRUNTS)  Hey, there's something I want you to see.  Some greaseball at the bar just drew a guy in a circle.  It's amazing. He's this, and then he's this.  You-you just y-you got to come see it!  Romeo, we got to get out of here!  Tybalt found out we're Montagues, and he's pissed.  Oh, man, I-I must have amnesia or something,  'cause I don't (BLEEP) remember inviting you guys.  - Who are you here with? - Uh Tony?  Gonna have to do better than that, man.  Lot of Tonys here.  Oh, did I say ""Tony""?  I-I meant I'm Abe Froman, the sausage king of Chicago.  You're Abe Froman, the sausage king of Chicago?  That's right.  - (PHONE RINGING) - Hello?  JOE: Yes, I'm looking for Abe Froman,  the sausage king of Chicago.  Heavyset fellow, glasses.  Oh, w-well, he's right here.  Let me just Wait a minute!  We don't have phones or Chicago!  All right, you got to die.  Enough! You three, out of my house!  I will not play host to some family feud!  (FAMILY FEUD THEME PLAYING)  100 people surveyed.  Top five answers are on the board.  Name something you might say to a damned spot.  (BUZZER SOUNDING)  Out.  - Good answer! Good answer! - Ah, good answer, good answer.  - Yeah, yeah, good answer. - Show me ""out""!  (BELL CLANGS)  What?! That's impossible!  Romeo, name something you might say to a damned spot.  Hello.  (BELL CLANGS)  - What?! - I know this audience.  - Of course it was ""hello."" - Of course it was.  (HARPSICHORD PLAYING ""IN YOUR EYES"")  Romeo?  - Juliet. - (DISCORDANT NOTES PLAY)  I know I ain't supposed to be here,  but I just had to see you again.  Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo?  I What-what what are you talking about?  I'm right here. You're looking right at me.  You know what? I'll come up there.  - Romeo, we can't. - (GRUNTING)  What if my father sees us?  And ""wherefore"" means ""why,"" by the way, not ""where.""  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  That's stupid. You're stupid.  Juliet, I know we just met,  but when I look at you, I feel something special.  This is gonna sound crazy, but will you marry me?  Okay, let's do it.  I love you, Romeo.  I love you, too, Juliet.  (BOTH MOANING)  I should probably let you know  I have a lot of Jack Skellington tattoos.  Well, I wish you would have told me that before,  but that's okay, because I do karate outside against no one.  Yeah, this is gonna be a good marriage.  There he is!  There's the dumb-ass I've been looking for.  - (GRUNTS) - (SHOUTS)  Mercutio!  (GRUNTS) I could never say this  when I was alive, but  ""Ralph Fiennes.""  (GROANS)  (GROWLING)  (GRUNTING)  (COUGHING)  (GRUNTING) Oh, God.  I'm voiding my bowels right now because I died,  not 30 minutes ago in the carriage on the way here.  (GRUNTING)  (GASPS)  Welp, we all know how this goes.  (SIREN WHOOPS)  I'm doin' it!  Oh, Friar Laurence,  are you absolutely sure faking my death  with this poison is the best plan?  Well, there's also Herbalife, which is an amazing product.  And I think you, specifically,  would make a great addition to our team.  I-I'll take the poison. Thank you, Friar.  A-And since I'm picking up a prescription,  can I, uh, pay for the rest of my items here?  Uh, I-I guess.  (ANNOYED SIGH)  Oh, (SIGHS) yourself.  I'm afraid she's dead.  You can tell by her shallow breathing  and weak but clear heartbeat.  I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.  Can you make a paper airplane?  - I can. - Then don't be so hard on yourself.  Oh, no! My girlfriend's dead!  And on top of that, it's that time in late summer  before football starts and there's no basketball.  I mean, there is baseball, but it's not playoffs.  I might as well just be dead!  (COUGHS, CHOKING)  (WEAKLY): Children having sex,  two murders,  double suicide.  Very irresponsible to teach this  in schools.  (GRUNTS)  Romeo? Romeo?  Oh, wherefore?  - Stupid. - I don't understand.  We had a plan!  Did you think I was dead just because I faked my own death?!  Maybe there's still poison on your lips.  Mm. Alas.  Just Costco hot dog. (SHUDDERS)  Well, a boy I knew for three days is dead.  And on top of that, WNBA season is over,  and it's still two months till figure skating starts!  (GROANS, GASPS)  BRUCE: For never was a story of more ""Oh, no!""  than that of Juliet and her Romeo.  (SIRENS WAILING)  I accidentally farted on a candle  at our Eyes Wide Shut party and this happened.  Now, please enjoy Fatal Attraction.    (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Man, is this a great black toilet loft party or what?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, which line of cocaine is for the bathroom?  - I think it's that one. - Thanks. I'll be right back.  (SNIFFING)  Dan Gallagher. Confident to meet you.  I'm not gonna be ignored by you, Dan.  No, no. No, no, that's later.  Would you like to dance in silence,  because they always add the music in post?  Sure.  What do you think they'll choose?  You take the good, you take the bad   You take 'em both and there you have   The facts of life, the facts of life.   Now, let's have hot sex in silence,  and they'll add the sensuous music in post.  (BOTH MOANING)  I wonder what music they're gonna add.  (INSPECTOR GADGET THEME PLAYING)  Inspector Gadget   Hoo, hoo   Inspector Gadget   Well, I'm done.  (THEME CONTINUES PLAYING)  Inspector Gadget   Hoo, hoo   TV themes were longer back now.  (INSECTS TRILLING)  I love our life.  Yeah. It's hard not to root  for a rich, white lawyer in the Connecticut suburbs.  (PHONE RINGING)  Dad, the not cell phone's ringing!  Let's let the new answering machine get it.  - (BEEPS) - Hi, you've reached the Gallaghers.  Leave a message for our intact family  - after the beep. - (BEEPS)  Hi, Dan. It's Alex Forrest.  I just found out I'm preg  Now I'm giving you a minute to pick up the phone hastily.  I got it, I got it, I got it! Hello?  Judge Forrest. (QUIETLY): How did you get this number  when they deliver a book that has all the numbers?  Dan, look over to the split screen and see how crazy I look.  - Eesh. - And, also,  I'm listening to opera,  but I don't know which one,  'cause they'll add it in post.  What do you think they'll choose?  No more Rice Krispies   We ran out of Rice Krispies   I see it!  God!  Hello, Dan.  How did you get in here?  I slipped the security guard five cocaines.  I told you it's over!  And I told you we need to talk.  I'm pregnant.  Are you sure it's yours?  - I am. - We can get rid of it.  They won't outlaw abortion until 2019.  No, I'm keeping it!  And one other thing:  the baby will not be ignored by you, Dan.  That's a very big thing for you, isn't it?  I need your help.  Alex, the elevator chick, is pregnant.  I don't want to lose my family.  What can I do?  Listen, just call your wife  on your numbers-on-the-top car phone,  and it'll all be better.  If I were you, Dan, I'd just go home  and enjoy your family and rabbit.  Most of these things just boil over.  That's odd.  Usually, our rabbit rushes up to greet me.  Well, time to wash dishes while looking at a lawn,  like most housewives.  (BUBBLING)  What in the world?  I better warily approach that pot in silence,  knowing they'll add dramatic music in post.  I wonder what they'll choose.  No more Rice Krispies   We ran out of Rice Krispies!   (SCREAM ECHOES)  Aw, I was going to kill the rabbit.  All right, listen, Beth,  I got something to tell you in front of our kid.  - I had an affair. - You what?!  I know. It was awesome at the time,  and, frankly, I was real close to getting away with it.  But now that there are actual consequences,  - I got to tell you the truth. - Dan, how could you?  Look, it's not my fault.  My plan was to just hide this from you forever.  Also, she's pregnant.  How is that possible?  Well, when a man and a woman like each other just a little  and they get in an elevator  Oh, God!  How could I be so blind?!  I wouldn't be so hard on yourself, honey.  But I will say,  at least she had a pot of something on the stove  when I came home.  (CREAKING)  (CREAKING)  Well, now to defog this mirror and see only myself.  (SQUEAKING)  Now to fully close the mirror and have no changes.  (GASPS)  I'm sorry, Beth.  I have a fatal attraction to your husband.  Ah! She said it! That'll be in the trailer.  I'm gonna do to you what I did to your bunny  and your neighbor's cat  because I went to the wrong house the first time.  (SIGHS) I love relaxing here with that dry ceiling.  Huh. Wonder if the weather called for living room rain.  WEATHERMAN: Next up, Connecticut,  your living room forecast:  dry, dry, dry.  (GASPS) That can only mean one thing!  (GRUNTING)  Oh, my God.  It's happening. It's happening.  Dan, help!  - Right. - (GRUNTING)  You deserve to die,  because the choices I made are your fault!  (MUFFLED CHOKING)  All right. She's mostly choked.  Let's just sit on the floor with our backs to the tub.  (SCREAMS)  (GUNSHOT)  It's just been revoked.    Hi, I'm Chris Griffin.  I didn't have a lot to do tonight.  But they did say they'd give me one minute  at the end of the show to share my favorite love story.  Of course, I chose the classic romantic tale  of the love between a young man and pastry,  American Pie.  The store was all out of apple,  so this one is chicken pot,  fresh from the oven.  Here we go.  Ow, the piping hot gravy!  Oh! And one of the peas went inside!  It's so burned,  I can't tell what's chicken and what's me!  Oh, God! Not gonna stop though!  Happy anniversary, Mom and Dad,  from your teenage son  getting busy with a 400-degree pot pie!"

There's not gonna  be anything good in that dumpster.  PETER: What if I told you everything I'm wearing right now  I found in that dumpster?  Is that a bachelorette sash?  Scott said I could do hand stuff this weekend, but that's it.  I told you this is stupid.  There's nothing good in here.  Hey, look a pair of working legs.  Dibs on these.  Wha?

Are you looking to build a city  where sports fans can be notoriously racist?  Yeah, and can we also ruin ""Sweet Caroline""  - for everyone else? - Absolutely.  Can our airport security people be responsible for 9/11?  And can our own 9/11 be, like, one one-thousandth as bad,  but we'll still make a fricking movie about it?  I think I know just the place.  Okay, I don't know if this is gonna be a problem,  but we forgot to bring the letter ""R.""  No problem at all.  Right this way, large-faced whites!  ALL (CHANTING): Let's go, Red Sox!  (RHYTHMIC CLAPPING)  Let's go, Red Sox!  What is that?  It's my Magic 8 Ball.  This is the first black ball  that Kim Kardashian hasn't played with.  Why is it filled with the blue liquid from tampon commercials?  That's a very gross question, Meg.  You may take your breakfast in the attic.  That question aside, I'm having a blast with my new 8 Ball.  It knows everything. Watch.  Magic 8 Ball,  will my middle-of-the-highway puppet show be a success?  Well, I'll show this thing.  (TRUCK HORN BLARING)  -(TIRES SCREECHING) -(THUD)  How'd it go, Dad?  I don't know, Sparky. What did you think?  The performance was a little flat.  (INSTRUMENTAL FAMILY GUY THEME PLAYS)  Magic 8 Ball.  Magic 8 Ball, I'm bored.  Should I sniff my coworker's hair?  He told me to do it!  Mr. Griffin, if a Magic 8 Ball asked you  to jump off a building, would you do that, too?  Did it?  No, I'm just using that as an example of  I listened to the toy!  Magic 8 Ball, what's the best email provider?  ""Outlook good."" Interesting.  He's not raving about it, but it's a solid choice.  Let's go, Peter. Time for church.  Mom said they're gonna serve Chewy Chips Ahoy at coffee hour.  Lois church?  Who am I supposed to worship, Jesus?  This is my god now.  Watch your mouth, Peter.  Sorry, Lois, but my religion is now the 8 Ball.  Magic 8 Ball, is the Fox network sustainable  in this new streaming world?  No. No!  (GASPS)  Kim, what's wrong?  A black ball went to waste.  Are you streaming Mindhunter in church?  I'm trying to stream Mindhunter in church.  Freaking guest Wi-Fi.  You know the priest gets the good Wi-Fi.  And yea, the Lord said  Whoa, whoa. Mindhunter's going in.  I mean (CLEARS THROAT)  Thou art the children of Abraham, and thou shalt  He's playing you!  You think you're playing him? He's playing you.  I hate this.

Nothing.  I guess I'm not feeling it. I don't know.  What if that's the only thing I'll ever be able to express?  Anger.

You invited us.  Sorry, but we can't have Stewie here.  I brought my own veggie burgers,  but I'm not gonna make a big deal about it.  What with his profanity and all, I don't think  Stewie would be a good influence on the other children.  Is there a designated spot on the grill  for the veggie burgers?  And again, not a big deal.  You're saying that because of a swear word,  my son isn't good enough for your pool party?  It's a little bit about him swearing,  but mostly about you as a parent.  Kevin, I said, no arrows!  KEVIN: Crossbows don't shoot arrows.  They shoot bolts, dumb-ass!  (CHUCKLES) Okay, sweetie.  KEVIN: Hey, Dad, did you hear what Einstein called bolts?  JOE: I heard it.  Brian, shut off the television.  It's ruined my baby!  What are you talking about?  Stewie obviously learned to swear from some TV show.  No, he didn't. The only show he watches is Caillou.  Well, then that little French-Canadian weirdo  is the potty mouth, I'm sure of it.  And I'm willing to watch every single episode just to prove it.  NARRATOR: Caillou was upset.  Why am I bald? I'm not a baby. I'm four.  Are kids just bald in Canada?  NARRATOR: So Caillou decided  to look himself up on Wikipedia.  God, this is dull.  CAILLOU: Maybe I'm supposed to be a cancer survivor,  and this show is very inspiring.  NARRATOR: But Caillou wasn't a cancer survivor.  The show's creators just made a weird choice.  Caillou's low-testosterone father  again indulged Caillou's tantrum,  clearly trying to raise a sociopath.  CAILLOU'S FATHER: It's okay, Caillou.  I'll bake you a pie.  NARRATOR: He said, his body flooding with estrogen.  Lois?  Are you dead?  (SNIFFING)  Can I eat you?  - Huh? What? - Ah, another time.  Oh. I-I, um I watched that Caillou, and you're right.  Stewie didn't learn that word from Caillou.  That means he learned it from someone in this house.  - Okay. - And I will find out who.  I'm gonna set a trap  and lure the swearer into revealing himself.  That sounds hard.  Oh, I will find the swearer.  CAILLOU: Dad, why are we sitting  on the washing machine?  CAILLOU'S FATHER: Because in Canada,  men have vaginas.  Hey, what's with the stairs? Why do they look different?  Oh, I'm trying to prove  that Peter's the one cussing in the house,  so I waxed the staircase for him to fall down.  PETER: Hey, Lois, have you seen my Spider-Man socks?  - I can't seem to - (THUDDING)  Ouch. Oh, heavens.  Oh, goodness gracious.  That's smarts. Oh, my.  Egad. Well, I'll be.  Yikes.  Peter, when did you become so polite?  Oh, I've been hanging out with Caillou's beta dad.  In fact, I'm meeting him at the park  to eat unsalted saltines on the swings.  I feel like you're wearing  what Rachel Maddow would wear to a pumpkin patch.  NARRATOR: Lois couldn't find the swearer,  nor could she remove the voice  of the grating Caillou narrator from her head.  Make it stop!  Not until you kill them all, Lois.  Oh, crap.  It's the lady with the baby who cussed.  - (LOCK CLICKS) - MAN: Turn out the lights.  Shh. Quiet, quiet.  H-Hello?  Hello!

I Instacarted some.  (KNOCKING)  Here's your stuff.  Thank you. Have a good night.  No.  Anyway, the point is  I have to deal with my anger and fix myself.  So I've decided to attend this relaxation retreat  at Vista del Vista Resort.  Uh, gosh, I don't know about that, Lois.  It sounds really expensive.  (SIGHS) No, I guess you're right.  There's no way we can afford it.  Plus, if I go, that means I won't be here  to help out around the house or feed you guys  or monitor your Internet usage every day  - You should go. - Yeah, Mom,  you should go, for sure.  (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)  Because they want to masturbate, you see.  Okay.  Uh, I don't know what that was,  but, Lois, you should go to that resort.  Go relax and fix yourself.  (GASPS) Really?  You guys'll be okay while I'm gone?  Sure. We'll have fun!  Just like that time me and Chris went Jet Ski'ing.  Yeah! This is awesome!  I know, right?  (DOLPHIN SQUEAKS)  Oh, my God!  It's okay, Chris.  I'm sure that was the only one.  Dolphins swim alone.  (SQUEAKING)  Okay, maybe we should turn back.  No.  Kill every last one of them.  PETER: Chris and I never spoke of that day.  But whenever somebody talks about how smart dolphins are,  Chris and I look at each other like,  ""No.""  (""AC-CENT-TCHU-ATE THE POSITIVE"" PLAYING)  You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive   E-lim-I-nate the negative   And latch on   To the affirmative.   Lois Griffin? My name is Roger,  and I'll be guiding this relaxation adventure  for you and the other white women,  plus an Asian woman who has a white husband back home.  I feel more relaxed already.  Now sit down and enjoy some spa music that's mostly rain.  Hey, guys, can we take it from the rain again?  (RAINFALL SOUNDS)  Well, Chris and Meg are off to school.  Guess it's just you and me now.  You want a Popsicle?  Huh?  Breakfast Popsicle?  Whoa, there's vodka in here.  (GULPING)  (BOTTLE CLINKS)  Now, what Uh, now, what is  Now, what (STAMMERS) what did you want?  What (STAMMERS)  Let's go play in the hot yard.  I'm two and a half hours late for preschool.  Your dad  What Who wants milk?  L-Let me quick just check in the freezer.  (GULPING)  You-you burger.  Here-Here's your veggie burger.  (STAMMERS)  It'll thaw out.  It You s-suck on it.  It'll thaw out nice.  All right, I'm out of here.  Ah, this is the perfect amount of drunk  for a Filet-O-Fish.    TREY: Hey.  I'm, um, Trey Headband,  and I'm your dumb yoga instructor?  Yoga is, um, good?  And from, um, like, China?  Ready?

(CHUCKLES)  All right, let's check in on Peter and the baby.  Okay, Stewie, time for Daddy to mow this very rocky backyard.  So I'll just put you in this baby seat you've grown out of,  right where the rocks are gonna fly.  Wait, what?  (GRUNTING)  Hang on! Stop!  - Aah! - Uhp, there we go.  - (STEWIE SCREAMING) - Wow, that's a lot of rocks.  STEWIE: Damn it! Ow! Ow!

Now it's time for everyone to choose a mantra.  What's that?  It's like a word you say that brings you peace.  A special word.  A word of release and catharsis.  You mean like (BLEEP)?  (GASPING)  Now, now, Lois, let's keep things acceptable.  I mean, I'm just saying I already have a word  that does all those things when I say it.  - And that word is - (STAMMERS)  Yes, we heard the word! Lois, please  No, no, maybe I'm not perfect,  but I'm a good person.  I love my children.  I like my husband.  And there are worse things  than occasionally using a swear word.  I'm out of here.  Guys, I'm worried about the baby.  He's hardly touched any of his birdseed.  Are you sure we're shaking him enough?  I'm home!  - (EXCITED CHATTER) - Yeah!  I missed you guys so much.  I'm so sorry I had that little meltdown.  But, more than that,  I'm sorry I left you guys on your own.  This is where I want to be.  Is that okay with you guys?  Of course, Lois.  Everyone's glad you're home,  except for mean older brother Buzz,  who never says anything nice.  Uh-oh. Here he is now.  Hey, Lois.  Pretty cool you're back.  Aw, I guess he's not such a bad guy after all.  Also, America should only accept white immigrants.  Uhp, nope, he's still a bad guy.  Well, I am so happy to be home.  But there's one little guy I missed most of all.  Where's my baby?    Stewie,  I-it's me.  I'm home.    Mommy!  - (GASPING) - Wow.  It's Stewie's second word!  Oh, my God! (CHUCKLES)  His second word was me!  ""Mommy.""  Oh, I love you, Stewie!  Ooh, ooh.

I actually do want some animal crackers, so  to be continued.  The stuff is in the top drawer,  so just, you know, get it ready.  I'm going to do something really nice for Rupert.  Show him how much he means to me, Annabelle.  Oh, no, no. No, no, I don't want you to kill anyone.  - I'll let you know. - There you are.  What are you doing up here?  Oh, hey, Bri. I'm making a collage for Rupert.  We've been firing on all cylinders lately,  and I just wanted to let him know I care.  That sounds stupid.  Well, Annabelle doesn't think so.  Right, Annabelle?  PETER: Holy (bleep), what is that?!  Wow, look at all these old photos.  Aw, I was such a cute puppy.  That's not you. That's Snuffles.  - He got hit by a car. - Oh, word?  You want to see something upsetting?  Look at this photo of Chris.  He's, like, three years old, and he's in a mobility scooter  rolling around an oxygen tank.  Wait. Is that Rupert?  - Oh, yeah, I guess it is. - What's he doing with Chris?  Well, Rupert belonged to Chris before he was yours.  - Didn't you know that? - No, I did not know that.  Yeah, he was named Skippy.  He had a different name?!  Yeah, Skippy. Chris took him everywhere.  - Used to sleep with him, too. - You shut up!  I think he was Peter's before that.  Oh, God, this can't be happening.  I thought Rupert was mine first,  not some multigenerational family dong koozie.  We need to talk, Skippy.  That's right, I know all about you and Chris.  Ah, ah, ah, don't. Don't run out, don't run out.  Look, just sit right there, please.  I'm not angry, all right?  I've j I've had a lot of time to think,  and, well, look, I-I don't see  why this has to change anything between us.  We both have a past.  (high-pitched): Hello, I'm a lady comedienne.  I want to get on stage and talk about my husband  and how he leaves the toilet seat up, et cetera.  Yeah, you don't seem like a lady.  Maybe a boy or a baby or something.  I don't know, but you're no lady.  How dare you, sir!  Must I show you my genitalia  in order to book a gig at this establishment?  - Because I will. - Go on. Beat it, weirdo.  (regular voice): Can I just stick around a little bit  so I can go up onstage when you guys win an Emmy?    Uh, I guess I'll hold it.  I had something memorized, and it all dumped out.  Uh, thank you to the Academy  and to all the viewers who watch.  Is the light keeping you up?  FYI, I'm more in love with Michelle,  if that was even possible.  Oh. Oh, you know, I still have that headache.  Well, if you want to go over to Chris's room  I'm-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  I said I wouldn't do that, and I did it.  I'm just gonna finish this chapter.  I'm trying, Rupert.  I really am. I want this to work.  It's just that sometimes I picture you in his bed, and  (breathes deeply)  Anyway, big day tomorrow. They're picking Busy Bee.  I should get some sleep.  (crying)  I'm sorry.  Nights are hard.  Well  I didn't get it. They gave Busy Bee to Frederick.  Frederick!  I'm not gonna hit you, so relax.  Anyway, the point is  it's not working anymore, Rupert.  I can't focus. I can't concentrate.  Clearly, my work is suffering.  Look, we're both adults. We can split custody of Simon.  I guess I'd better tell him.  - Simon? - (beeps)  You know Mommy and Daddy love you very much.  (beeps twice)  But Mommy and Daddy need some time apart.  (sustained low beep)  Simon. Simon. Simon.  Knock, knock.  Stewie, can you see who's there?  - What? - Someone was knocking at the door.  It-it was me. I just went ""knock, knock.""  There they are again.  I don't even know how to process that,  so I'm just gonna crack on.  I have somebody here that would like to see you.  - Your teddy bear. - You don't have to be coy.  I know he was yours first.  And, well, I want you to have Skippy back.  I know you're going to try and stop me, but hear me  - Okay. - Oh. Great.  Then I'll just leave him here.  I hope you're both very happy together, Chris.  He belongs with you, not me.  Well, I should get back to my book.  That's a clock, but okay.  This is just one night, got it?  Now, I'm going to call you Rupert.  You okay with that?  And tomorrow, nothing happened.  By the way, I have a Sleep Number bed.  But don't worry, I don't use it for sexual purposes.  (motor whirring)  What do you think of that?  That something you can work with?  (yawning)  Well, looks like someone was up late.  Yeah, I tend to sleep a little longer  when I'm resting under a big, furry bear.  Oh, no! They's doin' gay jokes without me.  Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay.  You're part of it now.  God, you're sexy.  What are you looking at?! I told you that was one night!  Now get out. I called you an Uber.  I'll know if you went further than your house.  - Hey, what are you doin'? - Oh, hey, Bri.  I was just putting some product in my hair, you know.  Yeah, this looks good. Give it a little height.  Let everyone know Stewie's back on the market.  I heard that on Friends.  Did you know they're all 60 now?  I knew Courteney Cox was.  So, how you doing with Rupert gone and everything?  Are you kidding? I'm fantastic!  He was kind of holding me back, if I'm being honest.  It's time I got out there again. I've had one bear my whole life.  - That's not normal. - Nothing about you is normal.  I mean, I've already wasted a whole year of my life with him.  There's only been a year of your life.  You know, all of your responses have been very similar,  so you might want to nip that in the bud.  Look, the truth is, things got a bit stale between us.  There wasn't one part of Rupert's body  that I didn't know by heart.  None of it excites me anymore.  Well, do you want me to keep an eye on Rupert for you?  Make sure he's doing okay?  No need. I turned him into a nanny cam.  - A nanny cam? - Yeah, I put it inside him.  Deep. It's inside him now.  I-I don't know how to respond that won't sound similar  to other responses I've made, so just, uh, continue.  Right. Well, whenever Chris and Rupert interact,  ten minutes later, I'll get a chime notification on my phone,  and I can pull up the video.  Why is there a delay?  Why can't you get the video immediately?  I don't know. Why can't you poop on a toilet?  - Fair. - (phone chimes)  Ah, it's chiming, it's chiming.  Okay, okay, calm down, just calm down.  (breathes deeply)  Now, what do we have?  Oops. Sorry, Skippy.  (gasps) Are you seeing what I'm seeing?  Is Chris wearing a nicotine patch?  You know what, it's just like I said.  He and Chris go together, like peaches and cream.  Peaches. Peaches, I'm sorry.  Damn it. You could've at least given me some warning.  At least a-a shoulder tap.  I know, you're right.  It's just that you're so beautiful,  I can't control myself sometimes.  Aw, I can't stay mad at you.  How about a kiss?  (chuckles): No-ho-ho-ho. Oh, no.  (forced laughter)  I'm sorry, was that loud? Sorry, everyone.  We're being loud. Oh, this is Anton.  Stewie, let Mommy help you into your high chair.  Well, I am a little wobbly today.  It's your fault, you know.  Stop it, we're with my family.  Easy. You're pinching my pits.  God, it's like being picked up with lobster claws.  We hate her, by the way.  Ah, I see you got my text to bring Rupert to dinner.  You're looking well. And this is Anton.  He's in the touring company of Dear Evan Hansen.  My, aren't we all very modern?  He's just here 'cause I got gum on him and he stuck to my hand.  Okay, that's sickening.  Remember when that bear used to be yours, Chris?  Oh, you used to take him with you every  You shut your mouth, you hear me? Shut it!  Oh, someone's tired.  Brian, you want to put the baby down?  Okay, yeah, he is a little fussy.  I'll take him upstairs.

Sammich!  When do I want it? Now!  I ain't eatin' no lipton soup.   So, kids, Bonnie just told me about the neatest thing.  It's called a podcast.  I guess it's like a-a radio show on your phone.  Have you heard of these? Podcasts.  Yeah, Mom, we know what podcasts are.  Huh.

""William.""  He was in Spider-Man with Kristin Dunst.  - Kirsten Dunst. - Right. Kirsten Dunce.  - It's not ""Dunce,"" it's ""Dunst."" - Yeah, Kristin Dunce.  In the movie, she dated William Dafoe's son.  Spell it, Joe! Spell what you are saying right now.  Well, I'll give it a shot.  K-Y-R-H  Look, there's a reason I became a cop and not a spellman.  - A what? - A spellman.  - ""Spellman"" is not a thing, Joe! - Sure it is.  Fireman, longshoreman, spellman.  Stop me when I'm wrong.  - He's getting too many right. - Now I'm starting to think  there is such a thing as a spellman.  PETER: Hey, guys. Check it out.  - It's groot. - Oh, yeah.  - From that Marble movie. - (SIGHS)  What are you doing?!  - Turn that chain saw off! - Not a chance, Lois.  You know how hard it was to get that thing started?  It was even worse than trying to cover anything with saran wrap.  (CRINKLING)  (GROANS)  (SIGHS)  (SIGHS)  (GRUNTING)  (SIGHS)  (SIGHS)  (SIGHS)  (GRUNTS)  (GROANS): Oh.  (SIGHS)  (SIGHS)  (GRUNTING)  (SIGHS) Perfect.  Can't wait to throw that out in two weeks.  (CHAIN SAW BUZZING)  Peter!

I think that's a marvelous idea, Chris.  I daresay we would make outstanding parents  - to this squirrel. - Hey there, Griffin boys.  I saw this tree go down. Any loot in it?  Elven treasures?  Uh, no.  Hey, donna, the tree's just regular.  DONNA: Go to work, Cleveland!  Well, somebody's getting big and strong.  Did you hear that one vet technician  say our little squirrel here  was in the 70th percentile for height and weight?  No. Which vet tech said that?  The one with the neck tattoo.  - Which one with the neck tattoo? - The one we saw  smoking in the parking lot when we were leaving.  Again, you're gonna have to be more specific.  The one wearing pajama bottoms as pants.  - Sorry, I don't - The girl one!  Oh, yeah, with the half-shaved head. She was nice.  Well, I'll bet this cutie is hungry.  Wh-what are you doing?  Don't film me.

He made a little toot.  That was me. It was one of my cross-legged ones.  I should probably stop recording.  Well, if it's your elbow that's bothering you,  we should start by checking your reflexes.  - (SHOUTS) - (SCREAMS)  - Okay, they seem all right. - Oh, that's good.  But you got to help me. My arm really hurts.  It all started after I got a chain saw.  Hmm, is that right?  Well, it sounds to me like you may have chain saw elbow.  - ""Chain saw elbow""? - Yes, it's all explained  in this video.  Hi, I'm Tommy Lee Jones.  Congratulations on suffering  from the coolest arm ailment there is:  Chain saw elbow.  As a celebrity dick, it's always been my passion  to own a ranch in a low-tax state  that I list as my primary residence.  And when I'm not pouting at awards shows,  I'm out in the field cutting firewood  - for a staged Instagram post. - (CAMERA CLICKS)  Sometimes I overdo it, end up with chain saw elbow.  Now here's fellow ranch owner Dennis Quaid  to discuss the dangers of tractor ass.  So, you have tractor ass.  Okay, so how much synthetic opioid do you need?  I'm trying to prescribe enough to earn a fanny pack.  A-aren't there any other options?  Well, there's a trucker hat, but those look stupid on me.  You know, sometimes joint pain is connected to back issues.  Have you ever had a chiropractic adjustment?  - What's that? - It's a procedure  where a guy who couldn't get into medical school  - tries to rip your head off. - Does it work?  If you believe it works.  It's kind of like the polar express.  - Let's do it! - Okay, I'll give it a shot.  But this type of thing is usually done in strip malls  next to a little caesars.  - (GRUNTING) - (BONES CRACKLING)  (GASPS)  Holy crap! What happened?  Well, I think we simply found your true height.  Before years of poor posture and wear and tear  - crushed your spirit and your spine. - Wow.  Mr. Griffin, let's discuss risk factors.  Do you lead a lifestyle that's sedentary?  Pet sedentary?  I'm saying you need to strengthen your core  and exercise regularly.  - Is that the hat? - Stupid, right?  I know the holidays are still months away,  but I was just so excited  to take our family Christmas card photo.  (CHUCKLES): Are you kidding? I love it.  You know what, Chris?  I feel like I'm ready to start trying  To find another squirrel.  What?  Nothing. I just  I just hit the lottery when I met you.  Here's your photo.  It's the only one where the squirrel  wasn't trying to bite your hand.  - (CHUCKLES): Ooh! - Oh, I love it!  - How much do we owe you? - It's fine. Just keep it.  Sears just closed forever.  Whoa! Peter, what happened?  Did you tease that witch again?  No, I got a back adjustment.  Turns out I've been this tall all along.  - You don't say. - Well, that's amazing.  Why are you still wearing the same pants?  I don't know. I only get pants at Christmas, so  I'll get pants at Christmas.  - So, how is it being that tall? - It's okay, I guess.  Although I've noticed I'm a lot more clumsy in the bedroom.  (BED CREAKING)  (LAMP SHATTERS)  PETER: I'm so sorry.  You two keep going. I'm gonna clean this up.  (CHITTERING)  Stewie! Stewie, come quick!  (GASPS) its first steps?  We've got to film this!  I know, I know!  (CHITTERING)  Look at that!  Oh, I'm going to cry!  I've never felt this proud.  That's going on Instagram right now.  Totally! But we should pair it with a song  about steps or walking.  Oh, my god, yes. ""Walking on Sunshine.""  Oh, that would sell it.  Sell what? That we're totally clichÃ©?  - How about ""Step by Step""? - New Kids on the Block?  No. The Eddie Rabbitt version.  And have people think we're 100?  Let's do ""Walking in Memphis.""  I will concede that's a good song,  but we don't live in Memphis, so I find it confusing.  What about ""Walk Like an Egyptian""?  Well, we don't live in Egypt either.  Ah. Hoisted on my own petard.  ""Nobody Walks in L.A.""  Again, we do not live in L.A.  Ooh, let's do ""I Love L.A.""!  Do you know what?  This is going to surprise you, Chris,  but I agree with you.  Let's use ""I Love L.A.""  I love L.A.   - (LAUGHS) It's perfect! -  We love it!   Yes, this will really tell people that  - (GROWLING, SQUEAKING) -  I love L.A.   We love it!   I love L.A.   Thank you all for coming today.  It means a lot to Stewie and me that you would be here.  I got this, Chris.  Everyone, after the service,  you are all invited to a small reception  to honor our beloved squirrel.  Nothing fancy. Just acorns and puddle water.  It'll take place either on top of the fence  or along a power line.  But, first, please join me  in a frozen-in-place moment of silence,  followed by a manic scattering in all directions.  (LIVELY CHATTER)  All right, the Quahog Fair.  Hey, Peter, would you get off your phone?  Sorry, young girls keep killing each other  'cause they think I'm the Slender Man now.  - (FESTIVE ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING) - Are-are you  Are you telling them to kill each other?  It's just a goof.  You sure you're not too tall for this?  Nah, it's gonna be great.    - Yay! - (THUMP)  - MAN: Ow! Who kicked me?! - Sorry!  - What the hell?! - PETER: My bad.  - Ow! Who's doing that? - It's that jerk up there!  (CACKLING)  (GASPS) It's Slender Man!  Kill yourselves!  - Peter! - Come on. It's just a goof.    Don't you dare touch its bedroom!  The squirrel is gone, Stewie,  and there's nothing we can do to change that.  Yes, thanks to you. If it weren't for you,  our sweet baby would still be alive.  - Me? - That's right.  If you hadn't kept the squirrel up so late,  none of this would have happened.  That squirrel should have been in bed, Chris.  It was 7:45!  What? I'm not the one  who just had to post the video to Instagram that very second.  You couldn't even enjoy the moment for one damn minute  before desperately groveling for online approval  from aunts you never talk to  and past coworkers you don't even like!  Is that so? Well, if you had a newer phone,  it wouldn't have taken so long to upload the video.  Well, excuse me for not having a fancier phone.  I'm only a paperboy!  Oh, I'm well aware that you're only a paperboy.  (GRUNTING, CHEWING)  Ah, perfect. I see you're using again.  Oh, I wonder why.  And don't think I didn't smell the Charleston Chew  on your breath at the service.  Maybe if you'd been a little sharper  on the evening in question, we wouldn't be in this  I had four skittles that night!  That's not zero!  You knew there was a dog in the house.  He's practically your best friend!  Or maybe even more than that.  You shut your damn mouth!  Oh, this is awful.  Why does death seem so much easier in the Rocky movies?  Goodbye, mick.  (WHEELS SQUEAKING)  Oh, wai you're just gonna put him in a drawer?  - What are you, like, filing him? - Yes, for tax reasons.  Jews don't die.  They just slowly depreciate  and then are eventually written off.    What's the matter, Peter?  I'm just sick of being tall.  I had a hard enough time getting everything in the toilet before.  I want my old body back.  Well, there is a way.  What is it?  Lock the front door.  (LOCK CLICKS)  Peter, if you really want to get shorter,  - I can berate you. - What?  The female power to belittle is such  that the recipient can physically shrink in stature.  That's why husbands and wives are the same height in old age.  Lois, berate me.  Okay, Peter, but if I do this, I really got to do it.  Do it.  (INHALES DEEPLY)  (EXHALES)  For starters, you're a failure.  - (BONES CRACKLE) - gah!  You didn't go to college.  Daddy pays our mortgage.  And you're a terrible husband and father.  - Ouch! - Your whole life  is a pattern of hateable noises.  - Ooh! - The way you chew a banana  makes it sound like it's filled with bones.  - Ouch! - I loathe the little wheeze  at the crest of every breath you take.  - Yikes! - I hate the one story you tell  at every cocktail party about almost meeting John Kerry.  That's a good story.  You didn't even meet him!  - (BONES CRACKLE) - Almost.  Your eyeglass lenses have been smudged for 19 years.  - Aw, crap. - (BONES CRACKLE)  Everyone hates it when you see fireworks  and you announce, ""this is the finale!""  - Please stop. - Pink Floyd is multiple guys!  He is?  You're so predictable.  I know every word that's gonna come out of your mouth  before you even say it.  BOTH: Balderdash. Heavens. Stop that.  I worked for purolator courier before they went bankrupt.  - Appearance. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) - (BONES CRACKLING)  Intelligence. (BLOWS RASPBERRY)  Penis size. (BLOWING RASPBERRY)  (BONES CRACKING)  And another thing!  Well, Lois, you are a master.  Well, let me first start by saying  y'all's doing your relationship a huge favor  by coming to couples counseling.  Now, why don't y'all start by each trying to suck up to me  so I can choose who I'm-a side with?  Well, I'm Stewart, and I would love to offer you  a freshly baked brownie.  Mmm. Oh, my.  Someone's already in the lead.  I'm Chris. I'm somehow both signing the checks  and always wrong.  See, this is why we came.  Right? It's this all day.  Oh, that's right.  I'm not allowed to mention I'm paying for this.  It's both 100% true  and also the worst thing anybody could possibly say.  He had his arms crossed the whole ride here.  Excuse me if I don't buy into  this whole headshrinker business.  Stewie promised he'd make healthy meals for us,  but all he ever makes is frozen pizza.  You said you loved pizza, especially when I make  the ones with the crust made of ""hwheat.""  He also does that.  Oh, really? Go ahead.  Show him those girls you follow on Instagram.  It's all bosoms and derrieres on there.  This is all stuff I've talked about with my life coach, Kyle.  (CHUCKLES): Yeah, ""life coach.""  Kyle's into you and you know it.  What?!  Okay. Chris, why don't you tell your side of the story  while I share looks with Stewart that say,  ""whoa, this is what you got to deal with?""  (CRYING): This is just so hard.  Stewie won't stop blaming me about the death,  but it's not my fault.  I didn't kill our squirrel.  You know, I'm sad, too!  - (CRYING) - I know. I-I just  I just don't know what to do with all these feelings!  Which is why I suppose I've been taking them out on you.  I'm so sorry, Chris.  (SNIFFLES) Me, too, Stewie.  We can't bring our baby back,  but we'll always have Tuesday through Friday of last week.  Keep talking.  I's just gonna open up this big book  and use the time you're paying for  to figure out when you're next available.  It was a true pleasure parenting our squirrel with you, Chris.  Likewise, Stewie.  And although his life was brief,  I'll always have very fond memories of him.  Wait, ""him""?  It-it was a her.  No, it wasn't. The squirrel was a boy.  What? That's crazy.  - Chris, he was a boy. - How do you know?  Well, you've got to check with your finger.  But you really got to get it in there.  Huh. Well, then maybe it's better  that our baby you molested is dead.  Ooh, fudge!  ""Don't be a grinch.  Please return plate to G. Quagmire.""  Oh, great. So it's a gift and an errand.  Oh.  Oh, dear.  (CRYING)  I love L.A.   We love it!   PETER: All right! New pants!"

I'm gonna make you a YouTube surfin' dog.  You know, one of those videos where you can't tell  if he's enjoying it or not.  - I love it. - I hate it.  Previously on Big Brother,  Tanner became Head of Household,  while host Julie Chen had plastic surgery  to look less Chinese.  Later, Sasha won veto power over Eric  but not before Julie married  CBS Chairman Les Moonves to get her job.  And Les himself was accused  of assaulting more than a dozen women.  With nominations looming  and Les fired for his predatory behavior,  the Boys Alliance of Jeremy and Pablo strategized  while Julie stepped down from The Talk  to avoid uncomfortable questions,  but continues to host this show and spend Les' enormous wealth.  Who will be evicted tonight?  Will Julie's craven opportunism ever end?  And what does it actually mean  to have an employee ""on call"" for oral?  This would be better with a snack.  Seems like a safe place to open a full bag of Cheez Doodles.  Hey. Sup?  Hey.  Okay, I'll give you one, but don't tell your friends.  Oh, yeah, yeah. No.  Hey.  Okay, Lois, the kids are gone.  Let's sneak under the boardwalk and have sandy relations.  I don't know, Peter.  Come on. I am so ready.  I snarfed a bunch of oysters from over there,  where the foam is super yellow.  Can you do it in less than two minutes?  When have I not?  Okay. Quick, before the kids come  Ah! Here they are.  Locals have renamed me Sandy Crevices,  and they're absolutely right.  Please have all my mail forwarded accordingly.  And we were so close to sneaking away.  I'm sorry, Peter.  Well, I guess I'll go throw this candy wrapper  in the beach trash.  See you in 45 minutes.  Ah, damn it!  So, what should we do now that we're finally down here?  How 'bout we do something that ain't been done  under a pier in 50 years:  have heterosexual sex.  So, a strange man is changing Stewie on our blanket.  Hey, mind your business, Brian!  We now return to Wreck-It Ralph 3:  Ralph Wrecks the Toilet.  Hey, Lois, I know we ain't under the boardwalk no more, but  You and me got unfinished business.  - Wha? - Come here, you.  What the hell? Wh-What is that?  It sounds like a happy family dishwashing scene?  Aw, crap, it's a happy family dishwashing scene.  Yay! We make a good team, clearly!  We work to upbeat music.  That means we're compatible.  They even let the dog pitch in!  How likable!  And the baby thinks he's helping!  He was probably filmed separately, though.  Notice he's just an insert shot.  Turn that music off.  And get the kitchen out of the living room.  Damn it! What do we got to do to get some time to ourselves?  Amen. Honestly  You guys are more frustrating  than trying to sell men's suits in Australia.  Wh Wh-What's happening?  Oh, my God, the iPad!  Thank God.  So, what do you think?  Uh, they're a little long in the leg.  Can you make 'em shorts, cut off the sleeves,  and make the shirt say ""Billabong""?  - Uh, sure. - Thanks, mate.  I really want people to see my snow-white back hair  against my brown skin.  Wh-What are we doing here?  Yeah, I-I don't know. This is weird.  - Would you like a belt? - Eh, I'll take two.  - One for each wrist. - No, this is not good.  I think we somehow sent ourselves into a cutaway.  So, what's the special occasion?  I'm marrying my catamaran.  I don't understand how we got here.  All I know is that we both set up  this cutaway at the same time,  and now we're inside this cutaway in Australia.  That'll be 23 Australian dollars,  - not regular dollars. - See?  So, you and I set up a cutaway at the same time  and that somehow put us in the cutaway?  Well, this is weirder than an uptight guy  at an Eagles concert.  Who out there wants to ""Take It Easy""?  Not me. Do you read the papers?  Look around you.  All right. Well, you want to  - ""Take It to the Limit""? - Not really.  That would be a little foolhardy, wouldn't it?  Okay. This time,  I set up the cutaway by myself, and it sent us here.  Weird. It's like this is a whole CutawayLand.  And it takes a setup from both of us  to get us in or out of CutawayLand  but only one of us to move within CutawayLand.  Lois, are you saying that it takes a setup from both of us  to get in or out of CutawayLand  but only one of us to move within CutawayLand?  Exactly, Peter. It takes a setup from both of us  to get in or out of CutawayLand  but only one of us to move within CutawayLand.  I want to be done with this part.  Who likes ""Life in the Fast Lane""?  Not anyone who wants to get there in one piece.  Peter, this may sound crazy,  but this is our chance at the getaway  we didn't have at the beach.  Hey, you're right.  No kids just you and me.  And we can go anywhere.  Like like when we hid in Tom Brady's locker  and watched him shower.  Look at that.  It's just as big as you want it to be  but not so big that it's gonna distract him.  There's a Trump hat in here.  Don't look at the Trump hat. Look at his penis.  All right, fine. You ruined this.  This is more frustrating than Charlton Heston's funeral.  Um, 'scuse me,  is-is this his cold, dead hand?  Uh yes.  He, uh he said I could take this.  Oh, oh, I want to do one.  This is better than a spin class  where the instructor is just two giant Swedish legs.  Congratulations!  80% of success is just showing up!  The other 20% is super loud, five-year-old Coldplay songs!  Yeah!  Who's ready to puke at 5:00 a.m.?  Ah, this is great!  Peter, where are you?  I'm a spin class bicycle seat.  Oh, no! The one middle-aged, post-gastric bypass guy!  He didn't clean these shorts from last class!  It was the strangest thing, Joe.  Peter and Lois were right here talking to us,  and they just disappeared.  All right, just keep giving me details  and I'll be taking notes and definitely not drawing  cool TIE fighters on this notepad.  Okay, well, it was 5:30 and we'd all just  gotten back from the beach.  We were all having fun washing dishes.  - Stay on target. - Then, out of nowhere, Peter and Lois  get all angry with us and start yelling at us.  There's too many of 'em! It's a trap!  But, wait, look at that perfectly drawn Millennium Falcon.  ""Roar!"" said Chewbacca.  Chris, now that Mom and Dad are gone,  we should have a rager.  Oh, I get those mostly in the morning.  You and me both, buddy.  Again, an insert shot.  We really had a hard time syncing our schedules this week.  Ah, this is wonderful, Peter.  It-It's like a honeymoon in CutawayLand, away from our kids.  Yep. Next stop, Paris.  Aw, crap, we picked the wrong line.  May I have your name, please?  Robert Loggia.  Can you spell that for me?  Certainly. That's ""Robert Loggia.""  ""R"" as in ""Robert Loggia.""  ""O"" as in ""Oh, my God, it's Robert Loggia.""  ""B"" as in ""By God, that's Robert Loggia.""  Oh, God, there are reruns in CutawayLand.  I remember this one. It takes a while.  Longer than it took to get my iPad back from Chris.  What is he watching?  BBC. Let's see what's going on in England.  Huh, I didn't know there was a BBC 12.  Oh, my God!  Brexit. Stage right.  Actually, I will take this.  This is wonderful, too.  I've always wanted to ride in a hot-air balloon.  Actually, Lois, it's a fart-air balloon.  So, what do you think of Santa Fe?  This is terrible.  I'd rather be in the pancake ER.  - What do we got? - It was a bad flip.  He got folded over on himself,  so he's still wet on the other side.  - Was he the first one of the batch? - He was.  Damn it! It's always the first one of the batch.  All right, get him in a room  and give him 20 cc's of Log Cabin negative.  The butter burned,  so there's a crispy black circle around the circumference.  Son of a bitch.  Tell the family he's going to lose his outer crust.  - Excuse me, Doctor? - What?!  Pancakes aren't people.  We need this wing for Covid.  I can't believe it.  Principal Shepherd came to our party.  Welcome. Glad to have you, John.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Is that girl here who wears the butt cheek bottom shorts?  No, she transferred to that alternative school.  Oh.  Do you happen to know if they're having a party tonight?  What? You can't leave yet.  You haven't even tried the cake.  This cake says, ""You can beat chemo, Helen.""  It was on a discount.  Helen couldn't beat chemo.  Dancing on a table, yo!  Things about to get cra Oh!  Cra Oh!  Sweet! A cutaway  about an unlocked hospital medicine closet.  I chose this cutaway 'cause it's fun  and for sure not to feed my fentanyl addiction.  You have AIDS   Ooh! And next door is a classic song about AIDS  that I now partly regret.  What a blessed day in CutawayLand.  Peter, this has been fun,  but I want to go back home.  - What? - I miss the kids.  I want to go back.  - I want to see our family. - But, Lois  - Is this Mr. Devanney's room? - Mr. Devanney, right.  That's the name of the guy with the AIDS. Next room over.  Lois, our kids suck  and cutaways are good. What's the problem here?  They may suck, but they're our children.  - Tom Devanney? - Tom Devanney, who in fact has AIDS,  - is next door. - My mistake.  ""Judy Garland Showtime Pills""?  What do these do?  Forget your troubles, come on, get happy   You better chase all your cares away.   Peter, enough. I know you want to have fun with drugs,  but what's the point of drugs  if you don't have kids to share 'em with?  Damn it, Lois. We're having fun for once,  but all you can talk about is the kids.  Well, I'm sorry, Peter. I want to go back.  And with any luck, we'll get home by wine o'clock.  - What was that? - Hilarious mom wine joke.  - You think so? - Oh, I don't think. I pinot.  Oh, boy, here I go.  Forgive me, Father, for I have zinned.  - Please-please stop. - Okay, you don't like these jokes,  but let's see what all the moms  eating soup at Panera Bread think.  Well, I don't care if you miss the kids.  I am not gonna let you ruin this.  - Tom Brady's locker. - Peter, we've already  Tom Brady's locker.  Okay, Peter, that's it.  We're going home, and we're going home now.  All right, fine.  Let's say it at the same time.  This is like the time we were together with our family.  Wh-Where am I?  Mom? Dad?  I haven't been given a morsel of food since you left,  by the way. Not one crumb.  I was just driving a car a second ago.  That's a problem, right?  And now to exhibit the only power I have in this world.  Stop.  Hey, stop.  He's not stopping.  You're supposed to stop for my hand.  You're supposed to stop for my hand!  You're supposed to stop for my hand!  You're supposed to stop  for my hand!  - What is this? - It's just a little mix-up.  Peter, let's try it again.  This is like the time we were together  with our family at home.  What Why didn't it work?  This is better than being at home.  ""We make a better team than"" at home.  ""Worse than"" at home?  ""The AIDS person is Tom Devanney,  which is the name of a Family Guy writer"" home?  Oh, God, Peter. I think we're stuck here.  Yeah. I'm also bummed 'cause I'm missing  that Australian guy's marriage to his catamaran.  Didgeridoo you take this boat to be your wife?  - I didgeridoo. - And now,  if there are any spiders the size of dinner plates  that object to this marriage,  please speak now or forever hold your peace.  Go get 'em, mate!  I now pronounce you man and boat.  Wait, so, when you two disappeared,  you were just doing cutaways?  - And now we're all trapped here? - In our defense,  we only disappeared 'cause we don't like you.  How did we get here? What is this place?  Well, Chris, it's CutawayLand.  Well, what are the rules here?  Okay. It takes a setup from both of us.  Highway   Let me slip away on you   Carefree highway   You seen better days.   And that's how it works.  I still don't fully understand.  Okay.  In order to move within CutawayLand  An old-time movie   'Bout a ghost from a wishing well   In a castle dark.   I still don't get it, but let's just move on.  What are we gonna do, Mom?  Shut up, everyone, shut up! First things first,  did you clean up the house before coming to CutawayLand?  'Cause if it's found messy, it's gonna reflect poorly on me.  Hello? Anyone?  Hmm, quite messy.  That reflects poorly on Mrs. Griffin.  Sorry to intrude.  I just wanted to let myself in to your private residence.  Huh. Nobody's home.  Nobody's home?  Principal party!  Now, when I was a young boy   At the age of five   My mother said I was gonna be   The greatest man alive   But now I'm a man   Way past 21.   We got to get out of here. Come on, let's think.  Huh, look at that.  They've got every other team's playbook alphabetized.  Don't look at the Patriots' rampant cheating.  Look at the Trump hat.  There's a phone.  Maybe we can call someone for help.  Joe was looking for you guys before. Maybe he can help.  I'll give it a try.  This cord is all tangled up.  What do I do, Patriots owner Robert Kraft?  Just give it a tug. It'll straighten out.  All right, I'm calling Joe.  Joe is on a vacation far away   You called him up to talk it over   Oh, yeah, this thing.  So many things that you want to say   Leave your message when the beep is over   I don't wanna miss your call tonight   Super long.  I already missed your call tonight   Joe, pick up.  Pick up, Joe.  Hey, Joe, what's with these crooks on Wall Street?  Oh, my God, don't even get me started on those guys.  Joe, shut up. No one cares. Just tell me,  are you in the real world, or are you a cutaway?  Uh, no, I'm at home.  - Why, do you need me for a cutaway? - Okay, good.  Just making sure you're not Cutaway Joe.  Hey, you know, that should be your answering machine.  Cutaway Joe to ""Cotton Eye Joe.""  Call me back in three minutes.  - Joe, we don't have - Call me back in three minutes.  I just called you, where did you go?   Where did you run to, Cutaway Joe?   - Hilarious, right? - Joe, we're stuck in CutawayLand.  - How do we get out? - Well,  according to a 16-year-old autistic fan in Akron, Ohio,  ""In order for the Griffins to escape  ""from a theoretical CutawayLand, they must first journey  ""back to the original Family Guy cutaway  with Adolf Hitler and kill him.""  That's it! We'll kill Hitler  to prevent CutawayLand and nothing else.  But how do we get there? Our setups aren't working.  Well, this is where it gets a little complicated.  ""In order to return to the original cutaway,  each family member must""  Does anyone know where the love of God goes   When the waves turn the minutes to hours?   Wow, Joe's instructions were perfect.  Well, who's going to kill Hitler?  Peter, I got to admit, I'm not comfortable with this plan.  Yeah, I know he was evil, but do we really have the right  to take the life of another human being?  Human being? It's Hitler.  Wow, the middle-class morality of Brian Griffin.  Hitler head, yo!  He cried like a bitch when I did it.  Let's get out of here.  We're we're back.  Meg, you saved us.  Why are all these principals in our house?  You don't want all these nuts roaming the streets.  Gary, another LaCroix over here.  - Pamplemousse? - If they have it, yeah.  Peter? Peter, are you okay?  Wh-What? What's happening?  You've been passed out for 22 minutes,  babbling about cutaways and Hitler.  - We were so worried. - I wasn't that worried.  Maybe you shouldn't have eaten those raw oysters.  I-I'm fine, I'm fine. Let's just go home.  All right. Let me take this sweet, sticky Popsicle paper  to that beach trash can that has bees on it now.  Damn it!"

And that Chris Christie lost all that weight.  He still looks terrible, though.  (KNOCKING)  - Oh, hey, Joe. - Hey, Peter. If you have a sec,  there's something I want to talk to you about.  PETER: Oh, boy, this is it.  He wants me to have sex with Bonnie.  Now, remember, Peter, you can't say yes right away.  You let him talk you into it.  He's watching for that. It's part of the dance.  I will absolutely have sex with Bonnie.  JOE: Sorry, Peter, you're too eager.  So, I came over to invite you  to Susie's christening this weekend.  - Oh. - And I don't just  want you to be a guest.  I was wondering if you'd be willing to be the godfather.  - Godfather? - Yeah, you're my best friend,  and, well, I'd like you to be Susie's godfather, too.  - Godfather II? - Wow, you're really warming to this.  Well, you've made two very compelling arguments.  Perhaps we should discuss this further in my poorly-lit den.  So, about this offer  What are you guys discussing? And when did we get a den?  Sorry, Lois, half of being a godfather  is closing the door in your wife's face  while she wonders what's going on inside.  But I just wanted to  PETER: I forgot it was a swinging door.  (BELL TOLLING)  (ITALIAN ACCENT): DiGiorno. DiGiorno.  Joe Paterno.  DiGiorno.  Damn it, Peter, being Susie's godfather  doesn't mean you're in the mob.  And you can't bring a cat to church.  Why not? He's Cat'lic.  (CAT SNICKERING)  (GIGGLES) He does a Muttley laugh.  Where's the priest?  Oh, the church ran out of priests months ago,  'cause of all the diddlin'.  Now they just have a rabbi fill in.  Shalom, everyone.  Welcome to the christening.  Now, before the child goes in the water,  has it been at least 20 minutes since she ate?  - Yes, Rabbi. - Wonderful.  Then let's dunk this kid like a doughnut.  I hereby christen this child in the name of Jesus Christ,  who was killed by we-don't-know-who,  it's not important.  The last thing we want to do is point fingers  Can you please take my daughter out of the water?  Sorry.  Congratulations, sweetie, you're a Christian.  From now on, every Sunday you get to eat a hard cookie  and pretend it's a guy.    Coffee in the smallest cup we have, as you requested.  - Grazie. - And let me assure you,  any shouting you hear from the kitchen  is not Gordon Ramsay tearing us apart.  GORDON RAMSAY: Oh, disgusting!  - (DISH SHATTERS) - Scusi.  Oh, God, here comes Doug. He just got a race car bed,  and now I'm gonna have to hear about it.  Hey, Stewie. Still sleeping in the slow lane?  (FORCED CHUCKLING) Okay. Okay.  So, your mom still taking you to the ladies' room  - to go pee-pee? - Actually, yes.  Yeah, me, too. I don't like the men's room.  All the urinals are at mouth level.  I don't look at those. I'm too busy fixing my hair  in the mirror Oh! I'm sorry.  Ciao, Stewie!  God, that was humiliating.  This party has turned south quick.  Like Bryan Singer's remake of Casablanca.  Here's looking at you, actual kid.  Everyone, I'd like to say a few words.  Uh, it's a very special day,  as we dedicate Susie's life to Christ  before she can consent to it  or have any conception of what's happening.  Susie once licked a booger off my hand.  - I'm Chris, by the way. - Thanks, Chris,  but let's wait till we're called upon, bud.  Anyway, thank you all for coming.  And to the host.  Joe, thank you for having us in this restaurant  with a painted wall that makes Venice look terrible.  OTHERS: To Joe!  Everyone, enjoy.  Uh, for the kids, we've got games  and also a party princess dressed as Elsa  who's clearly a prostitute,  but please don't proposition her here,  just nod in her direction, trust me, she'll get it.  It's her profession.  Oh, cool, they got a piÃ±ata!  - Peter, it's for the kids. - Like hell it is.  I'm the godfather of this event,  and I want a debilitating wine-and-candy headache.  Give me that, kid.  I'm your son, you dick.  Sir, please, you're making a scene.  No, I'm not. I can do whatever I want.  I'm the godfather.  Uh-oh.  I'm-a so sorry, sir. I didn't know.  Stanley Tucci.  Bobby Cannavale.  Hey! Portuguese waiters pretending to be Italians!  Get the godfather whatever he wants!  - Godfather? - There's a new godfather?  Aw, look at the wall.  Why does Venice always look-a so terrible?  From now on, you eat on the house.  You will be treated with the utmost respect, Godfather.  Grazie. Now please name the menu item I ordered after me.  The dinosaur chicken tenders?  All right, we'll find something else. Thank you very much.  Hear that, Doug? My dad's now the godfather.  And yours is  VP of Systems Integration or something?  What was that, Stewie?  I was invited to sit at the first grade table.  What?! How'd you get that invite?  Big D energy, Stewie.  You either got it or you don't.  Oh, yeah? What does the ""D"" stand for?  - Divorced? - (OTHERS GASP)  - Wh-What?! - Stewie,  my parents are trying to make it work.  - Gee, Stewie. - They're doing their best.  He ended things with the nanny.  Not that it's any of your business.  Oh, yeah. Uh, g-g-g-good for them.  Gene and Sheryl are wonderful people.  I-I hope they make it work. Good vibes. Healing.  G-G-G-God bless you all.  God, I can't believe Mike Pence came out of the closet  just before he hung himself in prison.  - Bon Jovi, family. - Morning, Dad.  Are things gonna change now that you're a godfather?  Good question, Chris. And yes, quite a bit.  I'll be touching faces a lot more than I used to.  My boys. My bambinos.  No touch.  And I'll be totally oblivious to the affair  between my bodyguard and my wife.  You look very nice today, Vincenzo.  Hey! She gave you a compliment.  What, do you got cotton in your ears? Answer her.  Yeah, meathead. What's with this guy, Pop?  And as a mafioso, I'll be doing more voice-overs,  which will always begin by naming everyone at the event.  - What does that even mean? - PETER: There we were - at breakfast.  It was me, Chris G.,  Meggs, Lois Griff,  Little Stew  and Uncle Junior Grandpa Nephew  who was my cousin.  It was one of those breakfasts where you realize  you put on your boxers the wrong way  and you need an excuse to leave the room.  - We're out of syrup. - I'll get it. You stay here.  And will you be a stricter dad now?  Interesting question. My value system  will vary wildly between incredible immorality  and intense social conservatism.  Dad, there's a shipment of heroin in our driveway.  - Excellent. - I watched a PG-13 movie last night.  In your mother's house?  Now, everyone keep eating until you throw up.  What's this? As a leader in the Italian community,  I'll be getting very upset about store-bought pasta sauce.  Peter, what the hell?  That was our Prego.  Yeah, and prego means ""you're welcome.""  It's a very cocky name for an average pasta sauce.  The rest of this is just jokes, but that's kind of a good point.  Now, kids, before you go to school,  let's discuss what you tell your friends about me.  That your fingernails are so filthy  because you do scratchers all day?  Never talk about the family business!  Things are too hot here for you now.  You need to go to Italy for five years.  - What?! - You're not safe here anymore,  so I'm gonna send you where all the murderers are from.    (GASPS)  A questo brajola que facia te di.  Rudy Giuliani.  Antipasti di Miguel Corleone a Sicilia di movies!  Mario Batali el gropo Buca di Beppo Ford Coppola.    Ooh! Aah! Mama Mia!  Check it out. Like all cool mobsters,  my office is at a strip club.  Yeah, but why's it in a male strip club?  Are you kidding? Dingaling's is great.  Now, just watch where you hang your hat.  'Cause of boners.  Now, you three are gonna be my lieutenants.  And don't worry, you're all equal in my eyes.  I don't care one bit if you laugh at my jokes.  I mean, this is the Mafia, not the Laugh Factory, right?  - Ha! That's hilarious. - Quagmire is now my top lieutenant.  What?! You said we don't have to like your jokes.  Well, I didn't realize it was such a chore.  This is bullcrap.  And, Joe, you're a cop, how are you okay with any of this?  Are you asking an Irish cop why he's corrupt?  Question withdrawn.  So, uh, what do we do now, Peter?  Well, now that we're a Mafia crew,  I have to do voice-over naming everyone at the event.  - What does that even m - PETER: There we were at the club.  It was me, Glenn Quags, Joey Swan  and Downtown Julie Cleveland Brown.  You remember when there were two Julie Browns in the '90s?  What a mess.    With the guys at my side,  we were the most powerful criminal organization in Quahog  We lived like kings,  until things started to come apart  after the Lufthansa heist.  We discussed laying low, but not everyone agreed with that.  Be careful with this. We stole it.  Hey, Brian, just a heads-up.  Now that I'm an Italian mob boss,  I may be treating dogs more roughly.  Uh, okay.  Now, where's my chicken parm from last night?  Oh, I, uh, I ate it.  - You ate it? - Yeah, there was no name on it.  It was just sitting there.  Is there a problem?  No. No.  No problem.  (ENGINE STARTS)  (GRUNTING)  LOIS: Peter, I'm home from the market!  I got steak sandwiches on ciabatta.  Oh, that's way better than chicken parm.  I'm gonna have it with my last can of cream soda.  Uh, actually, I finished that, too.  That's okay, Brian.  Let's take a ride and get some at the grocery store.  Pull over here. I got to take a leak.  - (GUNSHOTS) - (HORN HONKING)  Leave the gun.  Take the cream soda.  What's going on in here?  Even since Dad became a mobster,  he's been giving me a ton of Italian children's books.  Green Eggs and Pancetta;  Horton Hears a Yo;  Good Night, Mooks;  and Where the Wild Things Is.  - Stewie, this is ridiculous. - It's not all bad.  I like having those Stella D'oro breakfast cookies.  Oh, I ate those, sorry.  Ah, no problem, Brian, no problem at all.  Hey, what do you say you and I do a little fishing?  (GUNSHOT)  Peter, I just got a call from the school.  - When is Chris coming back? - Not for a while.  He moved in with his girlfriend.  But, apparently, they hit a rough patch.  (DOOR OPENS)  (BOTH LAUGH)  Good news, guys. I'm fixing the Olympics.  I paid a diver to take a dive.  (PHONE RINGS)  What do you mean he won?  You know, Peter, you've been a mobster for a while now.  I'm surprised we haven't had any run-ins with rival families.  What are you talking about? They love me.  Like, look at this, this morning, totally unprompted,  they sent me a lovely wrapped fish.  What?  Peter, do you know what this means?  Yeah, that they're nice guys.  Yesterday, one of them even drove by my house to say  I had a beautiful family and it would be a shame  if anything happened to them.  And that's a compliment and empathy.  When's the last time you guys said something like that?  - Uh, Peter, I'm not sure you - And look at this.  They found Meg's ear and returned it.  They returned it! You know how many guys  would keep something like that?  Peter, please close the box.  I think you need to get wise to what's going on here,  because their next message may not be so subtle.    (SCREAMING)  There it is. I've been looking for that.  Oh, thank God, the Mafia doesn't hate me.  ""You's dead, fat ass.  Love, the Mafia.""  (GASPS) Oh, my God.  The Mafia does hate me.

What's wrong with you today?  God, I can't believe Melania was deported to Slovenia  and then hung herself in a European prison.  Man, Peter, what are you gonna do about the mob?  Don't worry, I got a plan.  I'm gonna hide and change my identity  to a name no one else has ever heard of.  Roberta Brown.  Peter, that's my daughter's name.  No, it's just some girl I follow on Instagram.  You know, Peter, there may be a way out of this.  Cops have been trying to bring down  the Rhode Island mob for years.  If you can schedule a meeting to discuss your differences  and wear a wire, we'll arrest them after.  Testify against the mob?  How dumb do you think I am?  (HACKING)  - (GASPING) - Oh, my son!  I thought that hard-boiled egg seemed a little shouty.  All right, I'll do it.  But, man, if I'm in danger, so is Chris.  I better warn him to be on the lookout.  (CHEERING)  La dolce vita de duay que questa di Beverly Hills BMW.  Ay!  Que cosa mi amor.  Italiana, tu patri telefona Boyardee.  Grazie. Uno momento,  Vinny Testaverde con Carmine Ragusa.  Ciao, Francesco Di Napoli.  Tammy!    Okay, Peter, I'm gonna attach the wire now.  And I'm telling you in advance that it's cold.  Aah! Oh, it's cold! Oh, it's too cold.  - This is why I told you in advance. - It's too cold.  - I don't want to do this anymore. - Your body heat will warm it.  - I regret this decision deeply. - Just let your body heat  - do the work. - Oh, it's fine now.  See? That's the body heat.  Now, if you get into trouble, department regulations say  we can't go in there unless you say a code phrase.  Something that you'd never actually say in conversation  so we know it's a signal.  The phrase is,  ""Did you see the new Paul Rudd movie?  It's laugh-out-loud funny.""  Come on, can't I just say ""watchable""?  No, no, you have to say it exactly.  ""Heartwarming""? I-I mean, I could just say ""heartwarming.""  Peter, the phrase is the phrase.  Now, you ready to meet those godfathers?  I guess.  Wonder where the word ""godfather"" came from, anyway.  I don't know. I assume it started with God's father.  (PHONE RINGS)  - Yello? - Hey, Dad, I wrote a big show,  and your grandson Jesus is in it.  He's kind of the star of it, really. Can you make it?  (LAUGHS): Well, look at you. I'm there, pal.  When is it? When's the big show?  - It's Good Friday. - Oh, don't say Friday.  Ah, I was afraid of that.  Well, there's kind of a postscript to the story.  - Maybe you could catch that? - Oh, you betcha, slugger.  - It's on Sunday. - Oh, you're kidding!  Doesn't anyone do anything on Tuesdays anymore?  Listen, I'm getting pulled into this meeting right now,  but good luck with your thing.  I promise I'm going to be so nice to my son.    JOE: Okay, Peter, this is it.  Hey, who are you?  Just act natural. And even though you're miked,  try not to use your radio voice.  (RICK DEES' VOICE): Hey, Providence.  This is Peter Whirlybird Griffin  comin' at you on a sizzlin' Sunday afternoon.  - Peter, no! - Wait a minute.  You're the new don from Quahog.  Follow me.  We're glad that you finally decided to play ball with us.  Let me introduce you to the other dons.  Don Duck. Don Keykong.  - Don Amnesia. - Forget about it.  - Don Omatopoeia. - Bang.  - The Land Don Under. - You come to me today,  on the day of me daughter's barbecue.  Don Imus.  The Rutgers basketball team is Black and disgusting.  That's a wrap for Don Imus.  Finally, the scariest don of them all:  - Don De-Don-Don. - Thank you.  I'd like to introduce you all to my suspenseful son,  Don Don-Don!  And-and the guy says, ""Oh, I thought you were complaining  about your angina.""  You never told us a beginning to that joke.  Oh. Sorry.  JOE: Okay, Peter, the meeting's almost over.  Just don't blow your cover, and we're home free.  Hey, anybody want to do karaoke after this?  Sure. I can use the mic taped to my chest.  Peter, no!  Uh, the new Paul Rudd movie is watchable.  I repeat, it's very watchable.  Damn it, Peter! You have to say it exactly.  Fine. It's laugh-out-loud funny.  Freeze! You're all under arrest.  Good job, Peter.    Freeze!  All right, nobody do anything stupid.  H-Hold on, I'm just allowing Linkedln  to send automated e-mails to all my contacts.  I said don't do anything stupid.  - (PHONE CHIMES) - ""Peter Griffin wants to add you  to his professional network.""  Oh! Damn it, Peter!  Hands behind your head. On the ground.  Aw, we're gonna die.  All right. So long, you two.    (GUNSHOT)  Oh, my God. Thank you.  Prego.  Well, turns out being a mobster isn't for me.  Well, I'm just happy you're home safe.  Me, too, Dad.  Has anyone seen the rest of my white wine?  Sorry, Lois. I drank that.  Oh. That's fine, Brian.  Hey, what do you say you and me go for a walk in the woods?  You know what? This is kind of nice.  I thought you were gonna do some kind of Godfather murder on me.  Oh, Brian, I don't watch Mafia movies.  - But I did see Fargo. - Huh?"

Yeah, he's great.  But you haven't noticed anything different about him?  - Like what? - Well, I-I don't know  how to talk about this,  but here's a film my father made me watch when I was your age.  Then during lunch,  Ralph showed him some pornographic pictures.  Jimmy knew he shouldn't be interested,  but, well, he was curious.  What Jimmy didn't know was that Ralph was sick  a sickness that was not visible like smallpox,  but no less dangerous and contagious  a sickness of the mind.  You see, Ralph was a homosexual,  a person who demands an intimate relationship  with members of their own sex  Is that Earth?  Oh, for Pete's sake, I am 99% sure Bruce is gay.  What? Mom, he works part-time at Lush.  It's him and, like, ten girls. Trust me, guy's a total P-hound.  Listen, I'm just trying to  Oh, I know what you're trying to do.  Pathetic little Meg is happy for once,  and you just can't take it.  And I get it, okay?  You're in a miserable marriage,  so why would you want anyone else to be happy?  Meg, that's ridiculous.  Your father and I love each other very much.  Lois, where's the first aid kit?  I tried to put a Ellio's in the oven and I burnt my head.  - Top of the closet. - Oh, that little case?  I've been taking that to work to look like a businessman.  Hold the elevator. Hold the elevator.  Sorry.  Can someone push any button, please?  I don't work here, I'm just being silly.  I am throwing rocks tonight.  Mark it, Bruce.  Dang, Meg, you are hot tonight.  And you're not so bad yourself.  Ugh. My mother is so annoying.  She's got some kind of hair across her ass about us.  - Oh, no. - I know.  I told my folks about you and they lit up  - like a Christmas tree. - Really?  You bet your sugar cookies they did.  They's coming to town tomorrow.  But there's something I wanted to ask you before that.  Babe, I told you, I really don't want to sell Herbalife.  We'll give that time,  but this is something a little more special.  Meg Harvey Oswald Griffin, will you  Hey, hi. So, I told you about ten minutes ago  something's wrong with 14.  Yep, somebody's working on it, sir.  Dad, what's going on?  This sucks. I want to go home.  Please.

Forbidden!  Peter, I'm sorry, I'm just not okay  with our daughter marrying someone who is clearly gay.  You know, you're starting to sound  an awful lot like your own mother.  This isn't gonna be good for either of them.  Lois, let me ask you something.  What's the best-case scenario for someone like Meg?  Dying alone in a lighthouse? Maybe Bruce changed.  And-and either way, Meg's happy for once.  I say we go with it.  It's gonna be all right.  No, it's not gonna be all right.  It's never gonna be all right again if they go through with this.  Peter, we got to do  Get a hold of yourself, woman. She's coming downstairs.  Well, there's the bride-to-be.  - Oh, hey, Mom. - Listen, Meg,  I was hoping we could put all this behind us.  I'd like that.  That's better. And I'm sorry for what I said about Bruce.  If you love him, then your father and I fully support it.  Thanks, Mom. Speaking of which,  I'm finally gonna meet Bruce's parents.  Would you guys want to come to dinner with us?  - Oh, we'd love to come. - Oh, thank you, Mom.  Family hug. Bring it in.  Seriously, you got to bring it in.  Oh, Meg, I haven't seen you smile like this in a long time.  Probably not since you were in that music video.  Black hole sun, won't you come   I can't believe my little girl is getting married tomorrow.  Hey, hey, everybody.  I'd like you to meet my parents Phil and Candy Straight.  Peter Griffin. My arms were torn off at a concert.  So, these two lovebirds are gonna tie the knot.  Yes, a heterosexual marriage, just like you always wanted.  And I did, too. All of us did.  Well, as someone who doesn't get subtext,  I just want to say cheers.  You know what? This calls for champagne.  Sir? Excuse me, sir?  Ugh, this waiter is terrible.  Finally.  We would like your finest champagne  and your longest fork and knife, please.  So, Phil, what line of work you in?  Ooh, what did you order? Mind?  I can't believe my little girl's getting married.  You look beautiful, Meg.  Really? You think so?  Uh uh-huh. Y-Yes.  Five minutes, honey.  The Shropnicks made it all the way in from Colorado.  How about that?  Say hi to the Shropnicks. They came a long way.  Hi, guys. Thank you so much for coming all this way.  From Colorado.

I like mens.  This feels like an episode that someone  would get a prize for in 1994.  Maybe we should talk about this another time, dear.  No. I want to talk about it now.  I'm gay, and like all gay men, it was a choice I made  when I couldn't find a table at the high school cafeteria.  Cork up those ink pots. We know that's not how it works.  Everyone, thank you for coming,  but I'm afraid there isn't going to be a wedding today.  Oh, yes, there is.  Jeffrey, get your pimply little ass up here.  Jeffrey, will you marry me?  Oh, yes.  Come on, Shropnicks, we're leaving.  Let's start the 21-hour drive home.  You-you guys can't get married in the church.  We don't recognize you as well, as people.  Ugh, fine.  Everyone, meet us in the Walgreens parking lot  down the street.  Meg, sweetie, are you okay?  You know what, Mom? I am.  Bruce and Jeffrey love each other.  They deserve to be happy.  - And so do I. - Oh, Meg.  Don't make this day about you.  - Oh, Bruce. - Oh, Jeffrey.  Oh  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  It's nice that they're doing this,  but who's gonna marry them?  By the power vested in me,  I pronounce you husband and husband.  You may kiss when you get home.  Well, we just lost the prize.  Hi, I'm Peter Griffin. Meg's wedding took up  a little more time than we would have liked this week,  so we didn't get to do everything  we wanted to with my hands.  So, here's a supercut of me having a little fun around town.  We like it a lot. We hope you will, too.  Go, go, go!  Come on, big money.  Still $300.  Uh, how about T again?  Strike.  Strike three and he knew it."

Miss?  Thank you all for coming over to help us find  the best candidate for mayor.  This room is so diverse, so I'm assuming  many of you have agendas.  But let's keep in mind we need a mayor who will represent  all of Quahog and not just satisfy  your weird little fringe issues,  which are important, but not very important.  As a descendent of Quahog's Puritan forefathers,  I think we should be able to throw a woman into a pond  to see if she's a witch.  That seems a bit extreme, don't you think?  That's exactly what a witch would say.  Lois, you're making this harder than it needs to be.  Just get a former Batman and move on.  I'm sure Val Kilmer could use the insurance.  Peter, we're not going to get a former Batman.  That has been pitched every day since Adam West died  and the response has been tepid at best.  We need someone with fresh ideas.  Someone who knows the issues.  Well, if you're looking for someone with issues,  I think you've found your candidate.  (LAUGHS)  (STEWIE LAUGHS)  I had to go to bed early because it's a grown-up party,  but Mom said if I was quiet,  I could listen from the top of the stairs.  You know, I think you might be a really good candidate.  You know the town, you're smart  and you clearly have nothing better to do.  So all in favor of the librarian running for mayor say aye.  - ALL: Aye. - What about ALF?  Let's toast our new mayor  um, I'm sorry, I don't even know your name.  Elle. Elle Hitler.  (LAUGHS) No relation.  Elle Hitler? Eh.  Let's all say hi to Elle Hitler.  - Hi, Elle Hitler. - Yay!  I can't believe Lois wants the librarian to be mayor.  I mean, Mayor West was a legend,  and now they're gonna replace him  with some third-tier character with a joke name?  - That's Chinatown, Peter. - What?  I said, ""That's Chinatown."" It's from the movie Chinatown.  It means, like, ""What are you gonna do? That's Chinatown.""  Joe, did you finally get Netflix?  I did. And I just watched Chinatown.  It's kind of gross.  Quahog deserves a cool mayor, like Mayor West was.  But there's no one cooler than Adam West.  If only he had had a offspring.  Speaking of offspring, Faye Dunaway slept with her dad  in Chinatown and then had his baby.  Guys, that movie really messed me up.  Wait a second, Mayor West didn't have any kids,  but he did have a cousin, Wild West.  You guys don't know Wild West?  No. And please don't diminish us  for not knowing the same things you know.  You know how to land an airplane?  No, you don't. Asswipe.  I'm sorry. I see you, Quagmire.  - I do. - Thank you.  Wild West is a legendary cowboy and a spokesman  for everything manly. Look.    WILD WEST: You work hard, and at the end of the day,  you're more than tired.  You're man tired.  And when it's finally time to kick off your boots and relax,  nothing satisfies more than Beef Cigarettes.  Give yourself a treat   Nicotine and meat.   WILD WEST: Beef Cigarettes,  now with less hooves and snouts.  See? He'd be a great mayor.  - Well, what's his stand on abortion? - What? I don't  Does he make exceptions in cases of incest?  Because I've seen some things recently  that make me think he probably should.      (CHIRPING)  (SHUSHES)  You came at the perfect time.  (CHIRPING)  That was beautiful.  If you think the birth is beautiful,  you should see the conception.  Mmm. Jasmine oolong.  What can I do you for, stranger?  My name is Peter Griffin and I'm from Quahog, Rhode Island,  where your cousin Adam West was our mayor for many years.  And since he's gone to a better place  - Duluth? - I was thinking heaven, but okay, sure.  Beautiful country, Duluth.  The air moves into your nostrils like a welcome guest.  God, that's awesome.  Anyway, I thought you would be the perfect person  to take his place as our mayor.  Peter, have you ever killed a man?  Reddit says I've killed 39, but that seems low.  - Why do you ask? - Just making conversation.  Look, I know it's a lot to ask, but Quahog needs you.  You're the perfect person to lead us through  the last five years of the United States' existence.  So, what do you say? Will you be our mayor?  Can I tell you a secret, Peter?  I can levitate.  - No way. Can you show me? - No. But it's true.  Uh, that seems like the kind of thing  you have to prove right when you say it.  Well, I suppose you're right.  I appreciate you coming all this way, Peter,  but I can't be your mayor.  - But, Wild West, we need you. - (WHISTLES)  I'm sorry.  You get home safe, now. Hyah!    Thank you for coming out to celebrate  a new day in Quahog.  I would like to ask all the women to please put aside  your blinding hatred of other women  and vote for this incredibly qualified candidate.  ELIJAH: Stranger comin'!  Stranger comin'!    (NEIGHS)  He came.  Howdy, Quahog.  My name's Wild West, and I'm here  to throw my hat in the ring to be your next mayor.  (CROWD CHEERING)  And I want to say one more thing: I can levitate.  - (ALL GASPING) - But not right now.  That seems like something he should have to prove  - when he says it. - When he says it.  That's, uh, that's what I said.  Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?  You don't know anything about politics.  Well, you don't know anything  about landing a airplane, asswipe.  Besides, Wild West would make a great mayor.  He's a man  What does that have to do with anything?  Because this is America, Lois.  Men have always run things and there have never been  any problems whatsoever.  And don't say the economy or Iraq or income inequality  or racism or Brett Kavanaugh or air pollution or Vietnam  or slavery or Watergate or capitalism  or #MeToo or homelessness or police brutality  or homophobia or Monica Lewinsky or school shootings  or Native American genocide or Fox News  or Tim Allen or climate change.  (SIGHS) You make a good point.  But I still think more women should be in positions of power,  and I'm gonna work my butt off to make sure the librarian  becomes our next mayor.  And I'm gonna prove that Wild West is the better choice.  I've already made my first campaign poster.  I always start too big.  Afternoon, citizen.  My name's Wild West and I'm running for mayor.  - What might your name be? - Bruce.  Pleasure, Bruce. If'n you don't mind,  I'd like to roll up your garden hose for you, the right way.  - Oh, okay. - You see, Bruce,  every hose has a memory.  And you just got to tap into that memory.  You see this kink here?  I, uh (GULPS) I do see that kink.  Well, a hose is very desirous of its original shape,  and if you know how to work those kinks,  it should straighten itself right out.  (MOANS) Oh, merciful heavens.  (SIGHS)  If you need some help on your campaign,  I'm very experienced at taking polls.  Wild West, this is my daughter Meg.  She also has a mustache.  I can see that. Nice to meet you, Meg.  Wow, you've got a great voice.  Would you record my outgoing voice-mail message?  Ah, I'd be happy to.  And could you make it sound like one of your truck commercials?  If you're looking for something rugged, something durable,  something with an endless supply of gas  and a tailgate made for dumping,  then you must be looking for Meg Griffin.  Meg might not be much to look at,  but with two different-shaped airbags,  Meg is one ride you won't mind taking out  to the middle of nowhere and giving it your all.  She's road-ready, and rode hard.  Meg Griffin.  Kindly leave your go-by and Roman numerics  at the sound of the chow bell.  (BELL DINGING)    Peter, I don't even know why you're bothering  to take me to meet Wild West.  I will never change my mind about him.  That's all I ask.  Afternoon, Griffins. Glad you could make it.  Can I-can I go play with the barn mustaches?  - Please? Please? - Of course you can.  (BABBLES EXCITEDLY)  - (CHIRPING) - (LAUGHS)  Peter said something about me really sticks in your craw.  (CHUCKLES) Let's not make this sexy, okay?  I just don't think it's fair for you to breeze into town  with your rugged good looks and voice of the gods  and assume you should be mayor.  Especially when you're taking an opportunity away  from a very deserving woman.  That's a fair point, Lois.  Do you mind if I make you a sweater while I respond?  (EXHALES) Uh, no.  No, that would be fine.  Lois, I moved my whole family to Oregon when I was 13,  and it taught me that a town is like a horse.  You don't choose it.  - (BLEATS) - It chooses you.  And I believe Quahog has chosen me,  just like it chose my cousin Adam.  Now, the last thing I want to do is take something from a woman.  There's nothing I respect more than women.  (GIGGLES) Is that so?  Yes'm. I've raised 16 daughters  into strong, independent women,  I'm a registered doula,  and I always order edamame for the table.  (SIGHING): Oh, my God. Oh. Huh.  So, y-you're all alone up here?  With no one to  touch your sweaty biceps?  Huh?  A man's never alone, Lois,  so long as he has his principles.  (SHUDDERING): H-H-Holy thundering Lord.  Lois, can we keep it? I'll take care of it, I promise.  - (CHOMPS) - Aah!  Ow! He bit me!  I don't like it now.  (SQUEALING)  Peter, do you wanna maybe do some role-playing?  Okay. I'll be Quentin Tarantino,  and you be the foot I make a mess on.  No, actually, I-I was thinking  that maybe you could pretend to be a cowboy.  Okay.  (SIGHS): Oh, Lois  LOIS: Uh, make your voice deeper.  - PETER (DEEPER): Oh, Lois - Deeper!  PETER (VERY DEEP): Oh, Lois.  LOIS: Good.  Now say, ""Beef: it's what's for dinner.""  - PETER: I-I don't - Say it! (LOUD SLAP)  - PETER (VERY DEEP): Beef - Oh, yes.  - It's what's for dinner. - (LAUGHS): Oh, yes!  Oh, Wild West, Wild West.  PETER: What?!  Peter, what the hell are you wearing?  I went a different direction, cowboy-wise,  but don't change the subject!  (PAINT CAN RATTLES)  - Peter, what are you doing? - I've decided that Wild West  is the worst possible person to be mayor,  and I'm gonna do whatever I can to stop him.  O-Okay, is this because I called out his name twice during sex  and once while I was peeing after?  - That's part of it, yes. - I'm sorry, Peter, it just slipped out.  Well, I'm sorry I'm the length of a Mike and Ike!  In your dreams.  (TAKES DEEP BREATH)  That one stung, Lois.  (TAKES DEEP BREATH)  Ooh, that one stung.  All right, I'm on your side now.  And if you're gonna beat Wild West,  you have to recognize that one of his greatest strengths  is his voice, which makes him sound sexy and smart  and sexy and sexy.  Where your voice sounds like your dad's second wife  trying to describe something she saw on Facebook.  Oh, speaking of,  do you know what a meme is?  What Course I do.  And it's pronounced ""me-me.""  Well, the other day, I saw one  with the most adorable kitten  tangled in a ball of yarn.  (LAUGHING)  And underneath  underneath, it said: ""(BLEEP) the police.""  (LAUGHING)  Okay, that was unexpected, so I'm gonna ignore it  and bring in Morgan Freeman, who I've hired  to narrate your commercials.  We're gonna fight voice with voice.  Wild West claims to know what's best for Quahog,  but there's a better choice.  And I know about choice.  I chose to be in Ted 2.  Nobody made me.  I wasn't forced at gunpoint.  I relied on my advisors, and they let me down.  ""They'll fix the script,"" they said.  Well, they were wrong.  I thought I'd get to act with a talking teddy bear,  but when I got there,  it was just two ping-pong balls on a stick.  Or maybe that was Amanda Seyfried.  I don't know.  Okay, thank-thank you. Thank you, Morgan. Thank you.  Peter, just let me speak to the voters  about the issues they're concerned about.  Or, instead of doing that stupid thing,  we could sabotage Wild West's campaign.  Come on, you can drive.  Big Garfield fan, huh?  Me, too.  - Not this big. - You know, a lot of people  think I'm obsessed, but I think I'm pretty nermal.  (LAUGHING)  Okay, you reeled me back in.  (QUIETLY): Let's see how popular you are when I cut off your mustache.  (GRUNTS)  How is this so strong?  My hair follicles run deeper than the roots of a sequoia.  Git him, fella.  Oh! Aah! (GRUNTS)  Aah!  Nice work.  MUSTACHE (DEEP VOICE): Thanks, boss.  (BUSHES RUSTLING)  (SIZZLING)  - Uh-oh. - Hello?  Could somebody help me?  Don't panic, The Librarian.  (SCREAMS)  WILD WEST: Hang on, little lady.  I'm a-comin'.    (GASPS)  - I told you I could levitate. - You did.  BRUCE: Do the thing with the hose!  (INDISTINCT CHATTER)  Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.  Our top story tonight:  Quahog's new mayor is Wild West.  (CHEERING)  With a final vote of 43 to 19,  it's clear that no one really cared.  Nice job, guys.  Peter, can I talk to you?  - What? - Look,  I know we've had our differences,  but I'm hoping that someday we can bury the hatchet,  maybe even be friends.  Until then, I want you to take care of this for me.  (QUIET SQUEAKING)  (GASPS) For me?  Thank you, Wild West.  And I'm sorry I tried to destroy your reputation  by burning down a library.  I can see now that I'm better than that.  (SQUEAKING)  Wild West, I just want to say congratulations,  and I know you'll do a great job for our town.  I appreciate that, Lois, and you can rest easy  knowing that you and the good people of Quahog  are safe under my watchful eye.  - You ever kill a man? - What?! Why?  Just making conversation.  Wild West, why don't you play us a song?  Aw, shucks, I don't know if I could do that.  (PLAYING INTRO TO ""BLUE SHADOWS ON THE TRAIL"")  Arizona moon keep shining   From the desert sky above   You know pretty soon   That big yellow moon   Will light the way back   To the one you love   Blue   Shadows   On the trail   Little cowboy   Close your eyes   And dream   All of the doggies   Are in the corral   All of your work is done   Just close your eyes   And dream, little pal   Dream of   Someone   Bom, bom-bom-bom, bom, bom-bom-bom   Bom, bom-bom-bom, bom-bom, bom-bom   Bom, bom-bom-bom, bom, bom-bom-bom   Bom, bom-bom-bom, bom-bom, bom-bom, bom."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!     All right, time for 8:15 drop-off.  Now Mommy's on a quick break till 3:30.  [sighs.] Toughest job in the world.  Oh, look, Kylie's mom is out of rehab.  - Good morning, little guy. - Hey, Janet, good to see you.  Hey, listen, thank you so much for your apology email.  An individual one would have been nice,  but one to the whole class was fine, too.  Have a good day, Stewie.  [loud thud.]  Oh, my God, please be a dog. Please be a dog.  [crying.] Ow. Ow  Oh, my God, it's a kid!  It's Doug! Nice hit, bitch.  Oh, and Elsa underwear. This day just keeps getting better!  Well, thank you all for coming.  Can I get anyone something to drink?  I'm fine, but Doug's mother would probably like  three martinis, and then to have unprotected sex  with her boss at work.  And Doug's father would love a glass of warm tap water  and to never make more than $30,000 a year  - for the rest of his life. - And here we go.  Okay, well, I am just so sorry about what happened with Doug.  I just didn't see the little guy.  Well, maybe you ought to get your eyes examined.  I appreciate that it was an accident, Mrs. Griffin.  But nonetheless, we've retained a lawyer.  Well, there must be some way short of a lawsuit  we can make this up to you.  Well, this is my weekend with Doug,  but I've got tickets to see Lana Del Rey  with our former nanny Jessica.  [exhales sharply.]  She's 24. So as a form of settlement,  maybe this weekend you can put together a tree house  I don't want to deal with.  Fine. If that's what I have to do to make this right,  then Peter and my children will build your son's tree house.  Deal.  All right, I guess now the four men  awkwardly sit here while my mom gives your mom  a tour of the house that doesn't deserve one.  LOIS: And this is a room adjacent to the room  - we were just in. - DOUG'S MOTHER: Ooh, what a fun house.  Okay, Mrs. Griffin, tell me what you see.  Um, I see a cow in a lab coat,  some vultures in a cowboy hat,  and a dog trying to trick a cat into a clothes dryer.  Just as I thought. You're Far-Sided.  Oh, no. What-what do I do about it?  Oh, well, I'm no doctor, but I would say  you either need to get glasses or maybe LASIK.  Is that the surgery people get and then tell everybody they got it?  Yes, it's the veganism of elective surgery.  If you're unsure of what to do,  here's a video of Radiohead front man  and super weirdo Thom Yorke to help you decide.  Hello, I'm Thom Yorke.  You might know me from Radiohead  or my passing resemblance to a melting Tilda Swinton.  Not many people know that I'm blind in one eye.  Can you guess which one?  - This is awful. - Wait, just give it a few minutes.  - All his stuff starts kind of slow. - Fine, I'll get the LASIK.  Great. Make an appointment with my nurse.  Now here's a lollipop from the Sackler family  that says, ""Sowwy.""  THOM YORKE: In the future, we won't even need our eyes.  Computers will see for us.  Oh, now you're a doctor? I guess I'm a singer now.  Tra-la-la-la-la.  I'm Casey Kasem.  [Ã  la Kasem.] That was Elmer Hartman peaking at number 32 with  ""I Hate Computers [Tra-La-La.].""  Mrs. Griffin, the surgery was a success.  And by that, I mean the hospital agreed  to take your Discover card.  Plus, we'll get one percent of that back,  which is basically like getting nothing.  [gasps.] Oh, my God I'm blind.  PETER: What do you mean you're blind?  - Y-You can't see me right now? - No!  But you can still see, like, the stove and laundry, right?  - But, Mom, we got you a balloo - Shh, shh, shh.  [whispers.] She doesn't know about the balloon.  Don't worry, Lois, we'll be right by your side  the whole time, and not outside playing with a balloon.  [Peter laughing.]  I love you, balloon.  Oh-oh, oh, no, no! I'm coming, balloon!  [air hisses, Peter inhales.]  [helium voice.] Don't tell your mother about this.  Don't worry, Lois, I went blind a while back.  It was cool. They're some of the last people  you can still make fun of.  - Dad! - It's fine, they won't see this.  Dr. Hartman, you said there was very little risk  to LASIK, but now I am blind.  - How did this happen? - Okay, look, this isn't my fault.  It was Take-Your-Cat-To-Work day.  [meows.]  Dr. Hartman, what does this mean, you know, for me?  Well, whatever your wife did for you,  you'll now have to do for yourselves.  And until she gets used to her new life,  you'll need to take care of her.  Feed her, bathe her, drive her places.  - They're gone, aren't they? - They left, yes.  There they are. I thought we said 10:00 sharp,  but we must have said 10:18. [chuckles.]  No one's fault, but going forward,  let's make sure we respect each other's time, hmm?  - You must be Chris. - I must?  You know, we have a friend in common:  - Mr. Herbert. - How do you know Mr. Herbert?  We're friends. Sometimes he comes to my art shows,  and we get ice cream after.  Let me guess, he takes you to the park  where the swings go really high?  - He does! - Uh-huh.  That'll stop. And the ice cream?  Don't get used to it.  I've seen a thousand of you. I've outlasted them.  I'll outlast you.  Okay, uh, my dad left a note for you, Mr. Griffin.  ""Griffins, build this tree house for my son.  ""He will love it for a year, until my housekeeper  ""moves into it, even though it doesn't have electricity  ""or running water.  She walked here from Guatemala. She'll be fine.""  Let's get started, boys.  Aw, man, this is gonna be more work  than when I built that Habitat for Sean Hannity.  As you can see, we've made everything white,  like you requested.  Here's a room to recover from your sodium headaches,  and on the walls, I painted some of your most famous quotes.  There's the one where you compared  the homosexual lifestyle to playing in the sewer,  and there's the one where you defended Roy Moore.  - Nice. - Uh-huh.  And here's a room where you can blame things on an immigrant.  Hey, nothing personal, I just peddle hate for money.  ANNOUNCER: We now return to Blindflix,  the streaming service for blind people.  I can't believe it's the year 2034,  Earth is uninhabitable, and we're hurtling through space  to find a place for humanity to start again.  Thankfully, we are Chris Evans and Vanessa Hudgens,  and have sexy bodies that will make beautiful  racially nuanced babies. I love you, Chris Evans.  I love you, too, Vanessa Hudgens. Kiss me.  [both moaning.]  Ah, this show is so sexy.  How you doing, Mom? Do you need to go poopies?  Meg, please stop asking me that.  I'm sorry, I just I hate being so dependent  on other people. I feel helpless and worthless.  I get it. I feel helpless and worthless 24-sevs.  How do you deal with it?  Cutting, minor arson, and sometimes I post  empowerment videos on YouTube.  Empowerment videos?  I thought YouTube went out of business.  Uh, what am I thinking of?  - Circuit City. - Yes.  Here. The camera's on.  Just getting your feelings out will make you feel better.  Oh, okay. Um hello.  Uh, my name is Lois Griffin, and I am blind.  Uh, I went to the hospital for a simple surgery  and woke up in the ICU.  But the irony was I couldn't see you.  I couldn't see anyone or anything. [music.]  Even the people closest to me who need to be seen the most.  So now I suppose if I want to see again,  I'll have to listen more  and-and feel more and focus on what's on  the inside and not what I can see on the outside.  [sighs.]  Okay, that's all for now.  Mom, that was incredible. You really spoke to me.  Who-Who's that? Is that Lois?  Peter, I'm the one who's blind.  Sorry, I-I'm still getting used to things.  I can't believe Doug's dad texted me  and said we had to come to Doug's T-ball game  - or he was gonna sue us. - Looks like they got Big League Chew.  Yeah, I saw that. I saw that they got Big League Chew.  Ah, the baseball field. Good memories.  Lost my v-card here with Jennifer Jason Leigh  in that dugout right over there.  That was Fast Times.  Yeah, fast for her, maybe. I took a while.  [whistling.]  Excuse me. What happened to your big trip to Providence?  Good morning, sports fans.  You ready to witness the epitome of excellence?  Check this out.  [chuckling.] Oh. Ball one.  [grunts.]  Look, spaz, hold the bat like this,  and then step into it as you swing forward.  I did it! Thanks, Mr. Griffin.  - I'm leaving. - Come on, Chris.  Don't be mad. My plans changed.  - Oh, hey, Doug. - CHRIS: Are you kidding me?!  Mom, you won't believe what happened.  Your video went viral.  Oh, does that mean Circuit City's back?  No, it means your ICU video really connected with people.  You're helping people who feel unseen, Mom.  Like me. You're everywhere.  Okay, so what am I supposed to do now?  - Make another video. - Hi, Lois, I didn't get a monkey.  Off to see Bananarama. Bye.  I'm your Venus   Well, it's not what I thought it was gonna be either.  Mom, I made some ICU T-shirts.  What's going on? Who are these people?  My team. ICU has exploded.  There's ICU Fashion, ICU Skincare,  ICU Health. It is a gold mine.  Okay, but what does any of this have to do with  seeing people for who they really are?  Oh, pfft, who cares about that?  I do! ICU was an idea I could really believe in,  and you're ruining it.  I'm not ruining it, I'm expanding it.  You know, I'm the one who went blind, Meg.  I'm the one who's suffering.  Now the least I can do is make some money from it.  Now stand back. It's time to make another video.  Hello, Seers, Lois here.  You know, sometimes the darkness gets overwhelming,  and that's when I turn to ICU Essential Oils.  It calms you before sleep, or you can cook chicken in it.  [upbeat music playing.]  Oh, my God.  I can see.  Oh, God, but if anybody finds out, it'll ruin my ICU brand.  Ugh. Peter told me he'd been doing laundry.  You know, now I'm even wondering if  he lost those 75 pounds like he said.  PETER: What's that, Lois? I'm just on the spin bike.  Got a good sweat going.  Boy, you're right, Sarah loves those hills.  - Okay, here's the microphone. - Yeah, I see it.  I-I mean, oh, thank you. Uh, I-is that Meg?  Mom, what's going on with you?  Nothing. Especially my eyesight.  I am still very, very blind.  Thank you all for coming today.  I can't see you, because I'm blind,  but ICU. [cheering.]  Please be sure to try out our new colonic partnership  with increasingly irrelevant rapper Eminem,  the Eminenema.  It promises to clear out ""8 Miles"" of mom's spaghetti.  It goes in slim clear and comes out slim shady.  Thank you, I'm blind.  [cheering.]  That was incredible, Lois.  You're a real inspiration.  My name is Wanda Keptmymaidenname,  and I work for Helen.  [gasps.] Helen Disingenuous, the beloved daytime talk show host  who gives millions away to those in need  and is still somehow loathed?  Well, ""loathed"" is a little bit exactly right, but yes.  I'm here, Lois, because Helen has been following  your success and would love to make it her own.  Would you consider being a guest on our show?  Oh, my gosh, really? That's amazing.  So I get to go to Hollywood?  We actually tape the show in Burbank.  - Oh. What's the difference? - [laughs.]  That's hilarious.  I'll have someone who makes a lot less money than me  - set everything up. - Meg, can you believe it?  This is gonna take ICU global.  I'll be more popular than a Robert Redford clip.    Hey, guys. My dad made you another list.  ""Teach Doug to ride a bike, bake cookies,  listen to his Archer impression.""  This is ridiculous! We're not doing any of this.  I don't know, I kind of want to hear his Archer impression.  Yeah, I'm curious.  [as Archer.] I'm an international spy, but I also do mundane things.  Okay, all right. That's-that's pretty good.  But that's it! No more.  Then I guess my dad will just have to sue you.  You know what? Go ahead and sue us.  I mean, look at this guy. What do you think you're gonna get?  - We came here in his dog's car. - But we had a deal.  Well, the deal's off. I'll call your dad myself.  No, don't.  - [phone ringing.] - What the?  It was you making us do all that stuff.  - You made fools of us, Doug! - Get him.  - [Chris grunting.] - [Brian barking.]  Dad, help.  I'm not Dad. I'm Pete the Pirate.  God, I already told you.  Why did you do it? Why did you make us do all that stuff  For this. I did it for this.  What? What do you mean?  [sighs.] I don't have a dog or a brother.  Or even a father, really.  But these past few days I felt like I've had all that.  I'm sorry, but I didn't know any other way  to get you to spend time with me.  Doug, there you are. Thank God!    Hey, I got your message about the miscarriage.  - So, Saturday night? - What a dick.  You know what? I'm gonna go poop in his shoes.  - You'd do that for me? - Sure I will, buddy.  Hang on, Brian. I got one in the chamber.  - I'll join you. - Thanks, guys.  I guess that just leaves us.  Look, I think you're a total garbage person.  - Same. - And being nice to you goes against  - everything I stand for. - Same.  Okay, don't be the person who just says ""same,""  like it's a real response.  You know what, let's just hate each other in public  and maybe not hate each other as much in private.  - Like George and Kellyanne Conway? - What is up with those two?  Ah, this is really gonna put ICU over the top, Meg.  I am gonna be rich.  Now, which one is better, the blue or the green?  Wait, how do you know what colors they are?    [gasps.] Mom, you can see? I knew it.  Okay, fine. Yes, I can see.  I can't believe you've been lying. Why?  Don't you get it? I have to be blind  to keep the money rolling in.  Nobody's gonna be inspired by a middle-aged, cisgendered,  - able-bodied white woman. - Or man.  Now, you keep your mouth shut, or I will  - Knock knock. - Helen, is that you?  Oh, I'm so blind. [nervous chuckle.]  I just wanted to say hello, welcome you to the show.  Have you been to Burbank before?  - Never. - Oh, well, while you're waiting,  check out this video I made for the Burbank Tourism Association.  HELEN: [narrating.] Welcome to beautiful Burbank, California,  home of more year-round Halloween stores  than any other city in the world.  Do you like Jack in the Box? Then you're in luck.  We've got six of them.  If you've ever wanted to visit a place  where you can hear the freeway from literally  every spot in town, then Burbank is for you.  Want to do drugs in an empty swimming pool  with a couch in it?  Want to see what you imagine an affluent neighborhood  in Honduras looks like?  You can do all of that and so much more in Burbank.  [muffled loud music.]  [cheers and applause.]  We're here with Lois Griffin, founder of ICU  and an inspiration to millions of easily persuadable women.  So, Lois, I understand, in addition to everything else,  you've started the ICU Foundation.  That's right, Helen.  You know, you haven't really made it until  you're able to convince rich people to give you  money for a nebulous and undefined important cause.  And what will your foundation focus on?  Women's issues.  And the environment.  - Refugees. - [applause.]  Well, we support you,  so we've got a surprise for you.    Oh, my God! Reese Witherspoon?!  I love her!  [all gasp.]  Lois, how did you know it was Reese Witherspoon  - if you can't see? - Ah.  Um, that's-that's just, um, what I say  when I'm excited. Reese Witherspoon!  - Lois, are you actually blind? - Yes. I mean    [sighs.] No.  I was blind when I started ICU,  but I got my sight back a few days ago.  I just wanted to make a difference and, you know,  maybe get money from sympathetic strangers. I'm sorry.  Hey, y'all, can I put this big ole check down?  My arms ain't but small sticks.  Oh, shut up, Reese Witherspoon, you big phony.  There's no way you've read all those books  you slap your sticker on.  Well, Lois, you've disappointed a lot of people here today.  And since this is daytime TV,  you'll have to stand trial on a Black judge show.  [upbeat theme music playing.]  Lois Griffin, I find you guilty,  and I sentence you to pay your roommate back  for his dog food,  or whatever dumb [bleep.] this one's about.    Well, Lois, I'm glad you're not blind anymore.  Oh, me, too. I just wish I'd handled it better.  Hey, we should get to go to Hollywood.  - Burbank. - What's the difference?  Oh, boy, I'll show you.  HELEN: Want to get your car washed by a former Nickelodeon star?  Want to take an improv class from an instructor  you have to drive home after?  You can in Burbank.  Buy a house with a second floor no one got permits for,  and then watch the 98-degree winter nights tick by  through rusty bars on your windows.  Share a duplex with that guy from that thing.  Pay L.A. prices for Orlando amenities  in Burbank."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Ah, the record store  Full of the greatest albums of all time  and the employees who hate every one of 'em.  Hey, do you have the Eagles' Greatest Hits?  Yeah. It's under ""O"" for ""obvious.""  And ""overrated.""  Thank you, bearded failures.  You know, it's stores like this where you learn  about the real history of rock and roll,  not the watered-down version you get in every movie  about a musician's life.  Yeah, all those biopics are the same story:  unsupportive parents, hit song,  band turmoil  Having giant horse teeth and dying of AIDS.  All of 'em are exactly the same.  Check out this section for the Doors.  Jim Morrison is a legend,  whether we like it or not.  He had the good sense to die  before we could see him at the Pechanga Casino and go,  ""Oh, my God, that's him?""    It was the '60s,  a time of great fateful missed Frisbee catches.  The iconic band was formed one day  when Ray Manzarek met Jim Morrison on Venice Beach.  Thanks! I'm Ray Manzarek. What's your name?  Jim Morrison. Light my fire.  W-Wait a minute, wait. What'd you just say?  - Say that again. - Light my fire?  Yeah, that! That could be a song  that's tolerated for generations!  What do you say you and I form a band?  A band? But this is the '60s.  We don't have nearly enough floppy heads of hair to do that.  Hey, you guys starting a band? Mind if we join?  Yes. You're both in.  We are gonna be huge, you guys.  And nothing's gonna get between us  Not drugs or alcohol  or the first toxic relationship that comes my way.  Look out! Easily manipulated runaway comin' through!  Screw you guys! I'm following that lady,  and there's nothing you can do about it!  I am the Doors!  Jim, be reasonable.  We haven't even named ourselves that yet.  Look, I'm gonna get right to it  and say I miss making music with you bastards.  Thanks!  I'm Charles Manson. What's your name?  Jim Morrison. Kill Sharon Tate.  Wait a minute. What did you just say?  Say that again.  -  - [HUMMING.]  This is how women on drugs dance.   Yeah.  Jim Morrison. Love me two times.  W-Wait a minute. What'd you just say?  Say that again.  Well, Jim, I'm flattered you broke into my home,  but I have a serious boyfriend and I think you should leave.  But I'm a rock star!  And he's an astronaut.  You know, unfortunately for you, this is the one time in history  where astronauts are cooler than rock stars.  Well, I don't care. You're my muse,  and I'm moving in with my trash bags of bad poetry.  ""The caterpillar  ""A tiny hair snake?  Nay. Because of his many, many legs.""  ""The snake.  ""A large, hairless caterpillar?  Nay. On account of no legs.""  ""The snakeapillar""  Wow. Such a genius, huh?  Now, I do have a boyfriend,  but I'm also a free spirit.  [QUIETLY.]: That's my fun little way of sayin' I'm a slut.  So, how'd you like to have sex with my kite-sized woman weave?  Mm, it'll mesh perfectly with my giant nest of tight ringlets.  [MOANING.]  LOIS: Oh, Jim.  PETER: Call me the Lizard King.  LOIS: [MOANS.] Oh, Lizard King!  PETER: Yeah. Now call me Archduke Salamander,  Emperor of Newts.  LOIS: [EXHALES.] You're the Archduke  PETER: Ah, I'm done.  [VELCRO RIPPING.]  [GIGGLES.] Velcro.  Just like my shoes.    Early on, Jim Morrison had terrible stage fright,  so he performed with his back to the crowd.  The only thing that calmed his nerves  was what everyone was using back then,  Strawberry Nesquik.  It upset his stomach terribly  because of his lactose intolerance,  a condition that would escalate to full-on cream bigotry.  Yeah, that's the stuff.    And a one, two, three.   - [STOMACH GURGLES.] - Uh-oh.  [FLATULENCE.]  [QUIETLY.]: My fart's stuck in the pants.  Well, get it out. We've got a show to do.  [CHEERING.]  We all feeling good tonight?  [CHEERING.]  I know I'm feeling good.  [JINGLING.]  [AMPLIFIED FLATULENCE.]  [WOMAN COUGHS.]  Uh, this next one's called ""Break On Through.""  -  - [CHEERING.]  Yes.  ""Break on through.""  [SOFT CHATTER.]  Jim, there's someone you have to meet.  Hello. I'm someone with no knowledge of music  who is somehow controlling the music industry,  and I want to make you a star.  How do I know I can trust you?  'Cause I'm not just an agent  I'm a fan.  - Really? - Absolutely.  In fact, I'd love your autograph on the bottom of this contract,  in absence of any legal counsel.  Come on, buddy, you're embarrassing me.  They did it.  They signed the contract  that would make their cocaine dealer rich.  And then it was off to the studio  for a shirtless rehearsal.  [CLACKING.]    [HAWKING.]  [COUGHING, CHOKES.]  What the hell, Jim? You look terrible.  Are you back on the Quik?  [CLEARING THROAT.]  Please, I've barely stirred today.  Look, I'm sorry. I'm ready now, all right?  I'm ready to make this college dorm room poster.  [INHALES.]  Damn it, Jim. We're here to make an album, not a poster.  [GRUNTS.] Make an album?  Why didn't you say so?  Bring in the terrible, too-involved girlfriends, guys!  - [TAPPING.] - [STRUMMING.]  Jim, meet my girlfriend, Yoko O-yes.  She's beloved by everyone close to me  and prides herself on not messing with a good thing.  I'm just gonna get out of the way  and let you guys do your music.  You won't even know I'm here.    [CHEERING.]  You guys want to see something?  You want to see if it's as big as they say it is?  What the hell is he doing now?  PETER: That night marked the end  of Jim Morrison's rock god status,  when he was unable to find and expose his penis  in a Florida music venue.  [BOOING.]  Like every man who can't find his penis,  Jim Morrison moved to Paris,  where he did heroin one night and drowned in a bathtub.  There was a movie about the Doors.  If you're a bunch of guys in college  wanting to make all the girls go away,  put on the movie The Doors. Poof, they're gone.  Then it's just you and your buddies.  You could've gotten laid, but you put on The Doors.  Why'd you do that?    Well, if we learned anything from Jim Morrison's tragic tale,  it's that white guys definitely invented rock and roll.  What? That's bullcrap!  Rock and roll was invented in the Mississippi Delta  by Black people.  Jerome, if Black guys invented rock and roll,  then how come everyone else in a vintage vinyl record store  is a stock photo meme white guy?  You ain't heard of the Black man who invented rock and roll  'cause he never got a movie about his life.  But I'm-a educate y'all on the greatest rocker of all time,  Delta bluesman Muddy Drawers.    Muddy grew up in a shotgun shack in the Deep South.  His family was so poor,  they lived underneath the mighty Mississippi.  They all had to share one room  and one mustache.  Well, I'm off to make something of myself with this here guitar.  Don't go chasin' no white women!  Too far away! Can't hear you!    In those days, Black people had nothing,  but they still had to wear suits everywhere.  The only instrument Muddy could afford was a one-string guitar.  That one guitar string was also the family belt.    Despite all his setbacks,  Muddy would do whatever it took to master the guitar,  even if it meant making a deal with the devil himself.  So he headed on down to the crossroads.  The Crossroads being a fancy school in Los Angeles.  Tobey Maguire's kid goes there.  You'd see him sometimes, dropping off.  Not all the time but sometimes.  Hey, Tobey!  See you at the holiday show!  [SCOFFS.] Stupid fanboy.  You ain't ever getting that invite  to dinner with the Gyllenhaals.  Muddy was right.  He never got invited to dinner with Jake Gyllenhaal  or his sleepy-eyed sister,  which is probably for the best.  She looks like she chews with her mouth open.  But Muddy did get his guitar lessons.  From the devil.  Sign here and you'll be the greatest guitar player  who ever lived.  All it'll cost you is your soul.  Okay. You got yourself a deal.  And just so you know, with this purchase of a soul,  I will also give a soul to a child in need.  Yeah, yeah, I don't want that.  - It's no additional cost to you. - [SKEPTICAL.]: Mm-hmm.  It's just my way of giving back, out of my end.  Seems like it's probably baked into the price.  So Muddy went out and created a new sound,  the sound of rock and roll.  It was so groundbreaking  that an apathetic sound mixer put down his newspaper  and his stale cup of coffee to pay attention.    This song has one line   I'm gonna sing it several times   That's it   Well   This song has one line   I'm gonna sing it several times   Not just once   Listen   This song has one line   I'm gonna sing it several times.     The song was a hit  and got Muddy his first record contract.    Now, since he was a Black performer,  naturally, he went on tour  in the part of the country that's so racist  it's known as the Boston of the South.  He was given a white driver.  The record company chose an Italian American man  so Muddy would be used to hearing  all the worst racial slurs  before he got there.  Big crawdads guy, huh?  Oh, yeah. They're the best.  Please look at the road while you're driving.  I wouldn't know about crawdads.  - Never had 'em. - What?  You got to try 'em!  Here, take the rest of mine. I insist.  JEROME: But Muddy had had crawdads.  Many times.  That was just his little trick for getting free crawdads  from coarse Italians.    What are you working on?  I'm trying to write a nice letter to my wife Margerie,  but I never been any good with  - Damn it, what are those things? - Words?  Yeah, I-I never been any good at words.  In fact, I'm downright great at 'em.  I could help you if you want.  Yeah? Could you make it sound so she thinks me,  a white guy, is the one who actually wrote it?  Easy. Write this.  ""Dearest Margerie,  ""I can't wait to get home  ""and back that big fat ass up.  ""Back, back, back it up.  ""Back, back, back it up.  Wu Tang Clan ain't nothing to mess with.""  PETER: Dearest Margerie,  a lady who worked at the hotel we were staying at  had, like, the freckliest chest I've ever seen.  Yours, Vinny.  JEROME: Ultimately, Vinny went his own way  with the letter.    Hey, Muddy, I was thinking,  since we made it to the part of the story  where we realize that we're not so different from each other,  we should celebrate.  Yeah? What did you have in mind?  I don't know. Maybe  that!    [TIRES SCREECH.]  Whoa, whoa, whoa!  This is a ""whites only"" carnival.  It's okay, Vinny. Let's get out of here.  No! This is unacceptable, and it will not stand!  My friend is a human being!  We demand recourse!  [SLURPING.]  Unconscionable!  JEROME: And though the trip was soon over,  a friendship was formed that transcended race.  But it would not last long.  What the hell?!  All the pages in my songbook are torn out!  PETER: Dear Muddy, I have something to confess.  I stole all your songs,  and my real name is Elvis Presley.  That son of a bitch!  Damn you, Elvis Presley!  [SIGHS.] Oh, well.  There's still an exciting future ahead of me.  This ain't the end of my story.  Oh, no. The screen's turnin' sepia.  This is the end of my story!  I got to get to a stool for the one  ""old-timey Black guy musician"" photo  anyone will ever know me by.  Muddy didn't make it to the stool in time for his photo.  Elvis never gave him the credit he deserved.  And people were pissed when Green Book won that Oscar.  The end.    Great story, Jerome.  Elvis really was the best.  Peter, is that Stewie?  PETER: Oh, yeah. Looks like he's gonna do one next.  You're gonna let the baby do one?  Oh, I'm sorry, are your children funny?  No.  Ah, here it is.  Elton John's Greatest Hits,  a collection of songs by the one gay guy on earth  with a worse haircut than Pete Rose.    We'll defer that end-of-year bonus  to the following fiscal quarter,  harvest the losses on our cap gains  That's a no-brainer And, let's see,  update my beneficiary designations?  [CHUCKLES.]: Uh, yeah, I think so.  Damn, I'm good.  Elton John, what the hell do you think you're doing?!  It's just a little number crunchin', Pop.  What's going on in here?  Why don't you ask your son, the tax man?  I found these under his mattress!  W-2s!  I-I was holding them for a friend.  Wh-Wh-What are you doin', Pop?  No son of mine is gonna be a heterosexual paper pusher.  You need to be a loud-and-proud performer like your gay old dad!  [AIR WHOOSHING SOFTLY.]  Aah! You hit me!  Oh, Elton. I'm telling you this because I love you.  You'll never find someone to love you.  Not even Dolly Levi could help you.  - Who's Dolly Levi? - [GASPING.]  Oh, where did we go so wrong?!  STEWIE: So Elton John collaborated with Bernie Taupin,  who would write the lyrics for Elton's songs.  Bernie was married three times in a desperate bid  to convince the world he was not a homosexual.  [PLAYS NOTE.]  All right, Bernie, what do you got?  Uh, how 'bout this?  ""Yours are the sweetest eyes  I've ever seen.""  They are?  Whoa! I-I'm not gay.  You're not? Y-You just seem very  Yeah. I'm British. We all seem that way,  even if we're not but secretly are.    Elton, meet the best producer in the business.  Kid, how would you like to sign with my label,  Naive-Young-Talent Records.  Together, we are gonna make me millions!  Sounds fair to me. Let's get to it!  From then on, Elton's new male producer  rode him day and night.  When Elton was tired of playing, he'd get right behind him  and push him on the stool until he was finished.  Sometimes Elton would cry  because of how hard he was pushing.  But it paid off, because, in the end,  they had a massive load. Of hits.  Just a just a big, messy load of hits.  The night Elton John performed at Dodger Stadium,  he was so nervous, he almost never left the dressing room.  CROWD [IN DISTANCE.]: Elton! Elton!  Elton! Elton!  Whoa, dude, no!  I'm just a straight moment of clarity.  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't, uh  But his reflection had walked away,  never to return.  And he had to do his own makeup.  [CHEERING.]  Also, due to a scheduling error,  the Dodgers had a game that night,  and Elton had to bat fourth in the lineup.  ANNOUNCER: It's a mince-off single and the Dodgers win!  [CHEERING, WHOOPING.]  STEWIE: Elton John was heavily involved in the L.A. party scene,  and things took a dark turn one night  when he and Bernie went to a party in the Hollywood Hills,  one where you park way down at the bottom  and have to walk all the way up.  [PANTING.]  God, how much farther is it?  I don't know. You didn't get a TripTik.  That's 'cause the rock star doesn't get the TripTik.  The writer gets the TripTik.  Damn it, here comes another person  walking to the same party.  Let's stop, so we don't have to walk with him the whole way.  When they said this party was ""far out,""  they weren't kidding.  [FORCED CHUCKLING.] I know, right? Yeah.  Look, we've got to be close. I can hear the music.  Damn it! We're in the wrong canyon!  Well, I'm exhausted.  Come on, let's just go home.  I don't know. I kind of want to stay out.  Hang on. Hey!  What's the cocaine sitch like at that party?!  Enough to kill a Belushi!  But you probably don't want to come!  It's a real sausage fest over here!  I'm going to that [BLEEP.] party.  Elton, if you leave me right now, it's a big deal,  because this is the time of the story where that's a big deal.  What'd you say?! I couldn't hear you over the sound of snorting!  Have fun getting home without a TripTik, trip dick!  Whoa-ho! Looks like Elton learned how to write!  [SNORTING.]    How is he, Doctor?  Well, looks like your husband's gonna be all right, Mr., uh  I've been married three times! I'm Bernie Taupin!  You know what, don't worry about it. I already forgot who you are.  Anyway, congratulations.  Elton will be back on his knees in no time.  Look at me. At some hospital  next to a Denny's by the airport.  All day long, it's just Denny's and the jets.  Wait, what'd you just say? Say that again.  The important thing is you're alive.  Thanks. Hey, what do you say we get the ole team back together  for a ""what do they look like now"" credits montage?  Well, we can, but I'm not sure you'll like it.  STEWIE: That's what I look like?!  Who is letting me out of the house like  Someone in the future is seriously failing me!  BRIAN: Yeah, you look like a Candy Land villain that came to life.  - STEWIE: I know! - You look like a Muppet  that teaches kids about being gay.  STEWIE: All right, that's enough. Why are we making fun of me?  I'm not a bad guy. Let's just make fun of Sean Hannity again.  BRIAN: He looks like a guy who just OD'd on Just For Men.  STEWIE: He looks like Alan Thicker.  BRIAN: He's a guy whose wife yells at him  for getting his ball powder all over the bathroom.  STEWIE: All right, we could do this all day.  For more Hannity slams, go to Family Guy's YouTube page.  And, hey, if you think of your own, leave it in the comments.  BRIAN: He's the guy your mom dates twice  and then yells at you for the remote.  STEWIE: [LAUGHS.] Okay. But now we're done.  Well, I can't think of a better way to end our visit  than by remembering the four lads who started a band in 1962  and changed the world forever.  - Steve, Dal, Bob and Robin. - John, Paul, George and Ringo.  - Who? - Steve, Dal, Bob and Robin.  The Trashmen.  Oh  Uh, well, everybody's heard   About the bird   B-B-B-Bird, bird, bird   B-Bird's the word   Uh, well, a bird, bird, bird   Bird is the word, uh, well"

Everyone's dressed as GIFs.  Ain't that right, Pop?  Wow. This place is great, Glenn.  Yeah, they can really microwave eggs here.  You know, I'm so glad you trick-or-treated at my house.  I finally found someone  I can just say names from Succession with.  I mean, oh, my God, Kendall?  - Kendall! And Shiv? - Love Shiv.  - And what about Roman? - Yes!  And Logan.  Oh, Logan.  Oh, look at that dog.  Yeah, who brings a dog to a coffee shop?  - I love dogs. - Without letting me pet it.  Come here, you dog.  Oh, isn't he so sweet?  Oh, good boy.  Yay, my hand smells like you now.  Oh, I'm so happy you're a dog person.  I don't think I could be with someone  who doesn't love dogs as much as I do.  Yeah, it's great we like the same things  as soon as you say what you like.  So, what kind of dog do you have?  Well, uh, uh, what kind of dog?  Um you know, I-I've never noticed.  I I'm I'm more attracted to his spirit.  Oh, they're so special.  And you know what's right around the corner?  The strip club where they spit in your face?  No, the dog park!  For our next date, we should bring our dogs there.  Next date? Absolutely.  - Oh, and cousin Greg! - Cousin Greg!  Cousin Greg.  Phew, that tummy time was killer.  Totally blasted my core.  But I think that earns me a little treat.  What the deuce?  This bag was full last night,  and now half of it's gone.  Oh, my God, I've been robbed!  Rupert, check the jewelry box, see if anything's missing.  ""An engagement ring""?  Oh, ha-ha, very funny, but not the time  to have this conversation We've been burgled!  Well, looks like they only stole some of my Halloween candy.  But they're not going to get away with this.  Like the fat man when he plays Clue.  Okay, the murderer was ""don't care,""  with a ""this game sucks""  in the ""I regret having children.""  Clue you got someone pregnant nine years ago,  so now you have to play this.  Thanks for coming with me, Peter.  I need a dog for my date,  but I don't know the first thing about 'em.  No problem, Quagmire. But just know  I'm gonna spend most of the time here  finding the courage to hold an iguana.  Here he is.  I'm not sure I'm ready!  Uh, excuse me, how much is that one?  Oh, he's a purebred Bichon Frise,  so he's $1,500.  For a dog?! Um, and-and what's your return policy?  Is it, like, full money back within ten days?  Sir, if you're not interested, I have to comb feces  out of the guinea pigs' hair with a wet paper towel.  Go ahead, you can touch him.  It's dry.  Sorry we couldn't get you a dog.  Come on in, we'll have however many beers it takes  to forget how depressing the shelter was.  I'll go get those aforementioned beers.  Thanks, word-a-day calendar.  Oh, hey, Quagmire.  Mm.  I mean, mmm, there he is!  Brian the dog!  What's going on here? Why are you using my full name?  All right, let's cut to the chase.  I like chases.  Okay, look, I'm seeing this woman,  and there's something different about her.  I mean, it's not just that the sex is great, which it is,  but I appreciate her as a person,  which sounds kind of weird coming out of my mouth.  Anyway, I told her I have a dog, so  would you pretend to be my dog?  Well, well, well.  Well, well, well.  Well, well, well.  Brian, come on, I'm serious. Will you help me out?  Glenn Quagmire, there are not enough  tennis balls in the world for me to  - I have six. - I'll do it.  Thanks for doing this, Brian.  And remember, just act like a normal,  well-behaved, non-talking dog.  - Non-talking? - Yeah, just bark and stuff.  Bark? Geez, it's been a while.  Let me give it a try.  Brack.  ""Brack""? What the hell is that?  - I'm finding it. - Damn it, Brian!  I knew you were gonna screw this up for me.  I thought you wanted to help.  ""Help""? I'm not doing this because I want to help.  I'm only doing this so I can have a front-row seat  when you crash and burn.  Okay, first of all, it's incredibly insensitive  to say ""crash and burn"" to a pilot.  And, second, how dare you?  How dare you, Brian the dog?  You know I'm right you're gonna get tired of the sex,  and then you'll move on to the next one.  Oh, 'cause you know everything, right?  Well, you're wrong, Brian.  Okay, shut up, here she comes.  Hi, Glenn. This is Dexter.  Aw, and who's this little guy?  Uh, uh, this is Harvey.  Named after Weinstein, uh  'C-Cause you can see his balls when he answers the door.  I may be dating myself, but in the '90s,  the funniest thing you could do was show people your balls.  C-Can you start talking now, please?  Sorry, I couldn't hear you  'cause my dog was licking my ear.  Oh, thank God. This is my dog, Bob  Weinstein.  He's man's best friend  because he's very good at keeping quiet.  Do you mind if I take five minutes in the parking lot?  This is Spot.  All right, Rupert, when the thief comes back  for the rest of my candy,  he'll have to deal with my latest invention.  Hey, Stewie, what are you d  Aah! Help! Somebody help me!  I won't survive on the inside!  Thief! I've caught you!  Chris?  Stewie, get off.  I haven't been stealing your candy.  - Dad has. - The fat man?  He did the same thing to me when I was younger.  The only way to keep him away from it is to hide it.  And that's why I'm here. I'm gonna help you.  Really? You'd do that for me?  Of course, Stewie. We're family.  We look out for each other,  like the people on Succession.  Well, don't leave me hanging like that throw out a name!  - Tom. - Oh, Tom!  Can you believe Tom?  Carrie's gonna be here soon. Can you give me a hand getting  - this cat stuff out of here? - Where is your cat, anyway?  I don't know. No cat owner knows where their cat is.  Okay, but I still don't know why  you're going through all this trouble.  I mean, you're just gonna bail and leave her in the dust.  - Hey, how's your son, Brian? - Whoa!  What happened to DEFCON four, three, and two?  Okay, she's here.  Get off the couch.  - Who is it? - It's The Purge.  We're here to beat you up.  Coming up, one pizza with alternative crust.  Oh! Yummy, yummy!  Alternative crust pizza is really good, Brian.  You can't taste the difference.  What aren't you lying to yourself about?  Okay, you want to know the truth, Brian?  Brian the dog? I love her.  You hear me? Love.  This is priceless.  I haven't had this much fun  since I went to that graveyard.  Yeah, how do you like how this sounds, huh?  Try cleaning up this mess while you burn in hell!  - Peter, you ready to go? - Almost!  What do you mean you don't like that?  Just try it, maybe you will!  Thanks again for having us over, Lois.  Everything was so delicious.  Oh, my pleasure, Carrie.  Yeah, I've got to say, Glenn,  I've never seen you this happy before.  Well, then you've never seen me at my best before.  And it's all thanks to Carrie.  Aw, not at the dinner table.  I'm sorry, Peter, I just can't help myself.  I'm crazy about this woman.  Huh?  - ""Will you marry me?"" - What's this now?  Oh, my God, Glenn, yes! Yes, of course I'll marry you!  Mmm  Mazel tov!  ""Mazel tov""? Where did that come from?  From Marvelous Mrs. Mazel Tov. Y-you should know that, Lois.  Mmm.  Engaged?!  Aw, come on, Quagmire, you're killing me, man.  Babe, babe, please Babe, please stop crying.  Look, every couple needs to take things at their own speed.  It doesn't mean I love you any less.  Okay, look how about we look at rings this weekend?  I-I don't know. Zales, probably?  Well, that's what we can afford since only one of us has a job!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  Ugh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.  ""Why don't you join me for dinner?"" he said,  ruining his life.  There he is, the bridegroom to be.  That's right, the very happy bridegroom to be,  singing to himself.  Dat da dat dee   Da dee dee, da dee dee.   Oh, come on, give it up.  You're out of moves. Checkmate.  Hi, honey, we're home.  Will you help me move in his dog food,  like we're preparing for a flood?  Dexter eats all this?  Not just Dexter, but Dexter and all  his rescue brothers and sisters.  Oh, my God, how many are there?  Hmm, enough to do a slow pan with music from Airplane.  Is-is that one just a back half?  Oh, Backsy? Yeah. She's a fighter.  Well, maybe she should stop fightin'.  Okay, I'm gonna go bring in all their meds,  and then I'll set the 19 different feeding alarms  on your phone. Mm.  Shut up!  I didn't say a word.  I'm just I'm just thrilled you're getting  all the happiness you deserve.  I am happy. Parade magazine says  owning a dog is the secret to having a happy life.  You read Parade magazine?  If you know a better magazine for ordering plates  with people's faces on them, I would like to hear about it.  Hey, babe, was the Princess Diana plate important?  Brian, can you hand me that Parade magazine,  that envelope, that stamp and that checkbook?  Thank you.  Who are we waiting for, Chris?  I called in some professionals.  They're gonna take us somewhere Dad'll never find your candy.  - And where's that? - I can't say.  There are ears everywhere.  Good morning, Mr. Feldman.  Morning, Chris. Couldn't help but overhear  you're off on a little trip.  Never mind about that, Mr. Feldman.  - See? - I could hear that.  Get in.  You know, I should really be in a backwards-facing car seat.  They're now saying kids through eight  should at least be in a booster seat.  - You have any kids? - Don't make small talk with these guys.  No, no, it's all right.  It's nice to have someone ask for a change.  Yes, I have four children, all dead.  Ah.  Well, here we are.  Quick, hide your candy in the tree.  Is this our backyard?  Yes. But we couldn't take a chance of being followed.  Son of a I'm pinching and lifting.  Oh!  Hey, if you're making coffee, I'll have a  Whoa, kind of a mess in here.  It's fine. Everything is fine.  I'm happy and in love.  Damn it, Brian, did you leave the doggy gate open?  No, no, no, stop it.  Peppy, you're allergic to Frankie's food.  Malcolm, stop humping your brother.  Backsy, outside!  Babe, can you give me a hand  moving my furniture  all around the room until I find a place I like for it?  Kind of in the middle of something, babe!  Ah, the seven-hour itch.  Shut up, Brian. Why don't you go for a walk?  No, no, no, no, no.  No walk. No walk. No, no.  We're not going for a walk.  I gotta stop saying ""walk."" I said walk again. And there again.  Honey, I want to make a stir-fry tonight.  Have we unpacked the wok?  No, no, w-O-K.  W-O-K. She said wok!  She said wok.  She said wok  My candy, it's all gone.  Even my West Hollywood candy.  My Twinx bar. My very Milky Way.  My Reese's Penis.  Who's done this to me?  Who's taken candy from a baby?  Well, we did it. Cheers.  We sure did, Chris.  - Cool iguana. - He's dry.  I named him Arid.  Thank you, word-a-day calendar, travel edition.  Just met some of Carrie's friends.  They are very excited for her.  - Well, they should be. - Well, they should be.  And they are.  Anyway, expectations are high.  Thank you, everyone, for coming to our engagement party.  And an extra thanks to my airline buddies  for organizing it.  Uh, folks, our party time tonight is  two hours and 48 minutes.  We know you have lots of choices  for terrible weekend activities, and we hope to see you soon  on an inconvenient weekend for their destination wedding,  which I hear is on a Thursday in Lisbon, Portugal.  - That's so far. - Come on!  Yep. Yep.  It's been wonderful meeting all of Carrie's family  and friends.  I only wish you were all wearing nametags.  Isn't he adorable?  My expectations are high.  You know, I first met Carrie and her niece  a couple of weeks ago on Halloween.  Thank God they decided to take that walk.  And now we're headed down the aisle;  a very different kind of walk.  And, Carrie, if I may borrow a line  from our favorite song,  I would walk 500 miles  Stampede!  - Isn't he adorable? - He loves those dogs.  I'm hearing a lot of good things about that guy.  That's it.  Glenn, are you okay?  No, I'm not okay.  I thought I could do this, but I can't.  I've been lying to you,  and I've been lying to myself.  There's something you need to know.  I hate dogs.  Uh, this party has begun its initial descent.  That's not even my dog.  That's Brian, my neighbor's dog. He can talk.  Brian, say something.  - Brack. - Bite me.  Glenn I can't believe this.  So you don't like dogs, that's fine.  But you didn't have to lie and put me through all of this.  Good-bye, Glenn.  Uh, folks, please use caution as you exit the party  as some of your feelings may have shifted.  Well, well, well.  Save it, Brian. I'll concede that you were right.  But you know what? So was I.  Dogs are the worst.  And I'm coming for you, Brian the dog.  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,  But one day.  Maybe tomorrow.  And when that day comes, you're gonna say,  ooh, Glenn got me good.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to take a walk.  Brack?  Oh, no. Stay  You're coming back, though, right?  Hey, Brian, I was just over talking to Quagmire,  and he thought you might want to take a look  at my new screenplay.  - Oh, I-I don't really, uh - It's called Ocean's 1.  Between you and me, I can't believe nobody's done it before,  to say nothing of Ocean's 2 through 7.  Yeah, I-I could, uh, take a look, sure.  It's a little long right now.  It's about 430 pages.  I have my ""all is lost"" moment on page 389, thereabouts.  Quagmire!  Now, if'n you don't know, most Hollywood screenplays  wrap up at around 110 pages.  And if'n it's a comedy, why, you want it in the 90s.  Anyway, they said I could have these last few seconds  to mention something near and dear to me.  So, men, don't be afraid to have the doctor  put a camera up your old saddle masher.  They knock you out now, and it's a good way  to make sure there's no bad beans in your mess wagon.  We hope you've enjoyed the Family Guy."

                    			1 It seems today that all you see   Is violence in movies and sex on TV   But where are those good old-fashioned values   On which we used to rely?   Lucky there's a family guy   Lucky there's a man who positively can do   All the things that make us   Laugh and cry   He's a Fam ily Guy!    Welcome to tumbling class.  Moms, please enjoy,  while dads grumble about how much the class costs.  240 bucks for a mat and a room.  Now let's all gather 'round  because Stewie is gonna do a somersault.  (GRUNTING)  (GROANS) Nailed it.  Well, that's basically fine, and I don't honestly care,  so unless there's an unexpected appearance from a rival baby  Perhaps I could take a shot.  - (GASPS) - It's Doug!  That's Stewie's rival.  What are you doing here, Doug?  Eh, thought I'd give this tumbling thing a try.  So what do I do, just fall down  like literally anyone affected by gravity?  Um, there's a bit more to it than that.  One can't just show up and hope to execute,  say, a perfect somers  Oh, oh, he's very good!  (CHEERING)  Hmm. Something like that?  - Wow! - Now that's tumbling!  Boys can be good at this till nine, then the whispers start.  Calm down, it wasn't that great.  Stewie, give Doug your shirt and overalls.  He's my son now.  ANNOUNCER: We now return to Christopher Nolan's Tenet.  I'm already completely lost.  Dad, can I ask you something about girls?  Are you wearing a wire?  There's a girl in my class I have a crush on,  and I can't get her to notice me.  Ah, now I understand.  Lucky for you, there's a bunch of old movies  on this very subject.  Here. Sixteen Candles.  Can't Buy Me Love, Say Anything  all on very inconvenient VHS.  VHS? What do those letters stand for?  That information has been lost to history.  Anyway, Chris, just watch these movies  and do what the 28-year-old teenagers do.  I guess I could try.  After all, they tried to do Superman in Boston once.  I've noticed that you're never around when Superman's here.  Are are you Superman?  What is ya, wacked in the head?  I'm Clahk. Plain ol' Clahk.  Okay, back to our Boston newspaper job.  - (PHONE RINGS) - Spotlight.  What?!  (GASPING, MURMURING)  Show-and-tell time.  Finally a chance to reclaim my honor  after that whole tumbling fiasco.  Next up for show-and-tell: Stewie.  Hello, everyone.  This is a weird seashell  that kind of looks like female genitalia  that my dad likes.  Lois, where's my she shell?  Oh, Stewie took it to show-and-tell.  Well, I hope no one puts it to their ear.  Incredible, right?  (YAWNS)  Thank you, Stewie.  And, so you know, many middle-aged women have seashells  in their powder rooms.  Okay, next up is Doug.  Hello, gang,  and have I got some show-and-tell for you.  This is a ticket stub from a PG movie  that I got to see in the theater  alone.  KIDS: Wow!  Also, I've been on a Disney cruise.  Hey, who's this in the picture with Moana?  (CHUCKLES): Oh, me? Huh.  - KID: No way! - KID 2: Moana is famously agoraphobic.  Yes, but she's managing it day by day,  thanks to CBD oil.  This cruise was a big step for her.  Okay, I think we can all agree that  these are very lame show-and-tell  And finally, a piece of candy from the London airport.  (GASPS) Aw, a Lion Bar?  I'm sorry, did I say ""a piece of candy""?  More like British candy for the whole class!  Drumstick Squashies and rose-flavored wine gums  - for everyone! - (CHEERING)  Hello, Show-and-Tell National Championships  in DeKalb, Illinois, I have a nominee for you.  Dammit. I'm sick of being one-upped by Doug.  Hurts.  It hurts worse than a trip to the barber shop.  (SCREAMING)  This is what babies think happens at haircuts!  (KNOCKING)  Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Burbeck.  Do you have a daughter named Jennifer,  who is currently smeared across Highway 9?  - Joe, it's us. - Oh, sorry. That's my next stop.  Peter, your son was lurking outside a classmate's window  with this boom box, playing Peter Gabriel.  He's being charged with felony stalking.  I also tried to use science to make a sex slave  from a magazine photo.  Oh, this is horrifying!  - Actually, it's the '80s. - What?  Well, it appears that someone has exposed your son  to the very problematic teen films of the 1980s.  Peter, tell me it wasn't you.  Honestly, Lois, I have no idea.  My brain can't even think thoughts no more  - 'cause of the Internet. - Ugh, that's it.  From now on, you are an outside Peter.  Go on! Get!  (KISSING NOISES) Outside!  (GRUNTS)  Go to your Peter house. Go to your Peter house!  (THUNDER CRASHES)  God, look at Doug over there,  throwing a Frisbee with the kindergarteners  and a shorter-than-average first-grader.  - Thinks he's so cool. - Yup.  There must be some way I can finally one-up that guy,  and you're clearly looking for cat turds right now.  Yup. Y Huh? Wait, uh, wait.  - (SNIFFS) Aw, gum. - Help me out, man.  I need something to win back everyone's attention.  Wait, I know!  What if I flip my eyelids inside out?  Show everyone what a freak I am.  Huh? I could carve this out.  Right? This could be my thing.  I don't think so, Stewie.  All right, well what if I just, like, do Doug's mom?  Uh Y I-I mean, yeah, yeah, that  I mean, that would that would pretty much do it.  Awesome! How do you dial a phone or have sex?  Or stand up without using your hands?  Let me tell you something, Brian  (WIND WHISTLES)  Oh, no!  You said it, relatively-short-first-grader.  That Frisbee is way up there.  I'm too scared to climb up that high.  Me, too, average-height-kindergartener.  That jungle gym dates back to the 1930s,  when the lives of children were expendable.  Someone would have to be crazy to climb up there.  STEWIE: I'll do it.  What?  I'll climb up there and get that Frisbee.  Doug may be afraid, but I'm not.  Just give me a day to get prepared and gear up,  and at sunrise tomorrow, I will climb up there  and retrieve that Frisbee.  Or we can ask Spider-Man to do it.  He came to my birthday party. I know him.  That wasn't the real Spider-Man. That was your dad.  We could see his hernia popping through the suit.  Hey, Tyler!  Heard Spider-Man had a pretty good time at your party.  Don't mind me, Brian. Just pushing the edge.  Hmm.  14 zippers, if you must know,  but it's not about my pants, Brian.  It's about my fearlessness and pants.  Now, I need to plan out  every last inch of my climb tomorrow.  If I do this right, I'm gonna be remembered forever,  like 9/11 was for a few years.  You're just climbing a jungle gym.  - It's not a big deal. - Not a big deal?  I pull this off, I go down in history!  Like my ancestor: The Guy Who Was Hanged Next to Nathan Hale.  I regret that I have but one life to give for my country.  If you kill me, I'm gonna immediately void.  All over here. All over here.  You, historian, write down both our things.  Hey, Lois, how about we get a little three-way going?  - You, me and the seashell? - Oh, forget it, Peter.  After that whole thing with the '80s movies,  I'm very upset with you.  Well, can you use that anger in the sex?  No, Peter, your '80s nostalgia isn't funny anymore.  It's tired and worn out, and borderline dangerous.  I mean, those old references just don't play  the same in today's world.  What you talkin' 'bout, Lois?  This! This is exactly what I'm talking about!  When are you gonna let the '80s go?  Never! The '80s will always be the best decade.  And I'm confident  that non-whites and women would agree with that.  Everyone else, too. And I'm gonna prove it.  Family! Come here conveniently fast, please!  - What is it, Peter? - I have decided to prove to you all  that the '80s are still relevant and hilarious.  But they're not.  And in keeping with the wonderful 1980s,  I'm gonna go upstairs and drill a hole in the wall  to watch girls shower.  Peter, in addition to that being wildly problematic,  you can't just drill a hole in a structural wall.  Do you even know how to do that?  Okay, that's one drywall bit, one masonry bit,  one spur point bit, one tile bit,  one drill with a hammer action setting,  one wire detector, one stud finder,  and one grease pencil.  Sounds like someone's drilling a hole in the wall  to watch girls shower.  - Oh, big time. - Did you pull a permit?  City hall's next.  BOTH: Nice!  I'm all right   Nobody worry about me.   (SPLATTERING)  Oh, my God! What did you do?  He was supposed to get away.  It was gonna be harmless '80s fun.  You killed the gopher!  - He's all right? - No! He's not all right!  We're all gonna get laid?  Dammit, Peter!  Stop saying blandly upbeat things from the movie!  This has to stop!  (SIGHS) You're right.  Man, and I was so sure that stuff from the '80s  would still play the same today.  I guess people are only interested in that  for 19 seasons.  Hi, I'm Kenny Loggins,  and I'm still very interested in '80s references.  Every time Family Guy plays one of my songs,  I get a new hot tub for my Colorado deck.  I'm all right   Nobody worry about me.   All right, you guys ready to watch some history be made  by Stewie Griffin?  DOUG: And guest?  What the? 11, 12, 13  15 zippers! You've got to be (BLEEP) kidding me!  What do you say, Stewie?  A friendly race to the top in front of all these kids,  plus the red-haired girl from the Charlie Brown cartoons?  Aw. I care about her opinion most of all!  You don't care about me.  You just wanted to wear my ballerina skirt.  I especially love her sense of humor  and inventive storytelling.  Okay, you're on. First to the Frisbee wins.  You realize, Doug, we might die up there today.  Then I'll see you in heck.    (GRUNTS)  (GRUNTS)  Okay, toughest part of the climb: Dried Booger Ridge.  (STRAINING)    (GASPS) The Frisbee!    Yes! I win!  I'm going all the way   Sooner or later gotta love somebody.   Wha?  (GRUNTING)  Oh, no! Help! Help!  Help me!  What? We can't hear you!  Our voices are very faint because we are so distant!  Distant from you, he means!  We're not distant from each other!  We're standing relatively close together!  You probably were already able to infer that,  and Connor just wasted everyone's time!  My God. I  I'm stuck up here.  Better use my emergency flare.  We've got a flare.  I'm still stuck, but now I have confidence.  (STRAINING)  My foot is still stuck,  and it's really starting to hurt.  And I know you're going to be insufferable about this.  Stewie, come on.  Right now your safety is what matters.  And you've got an owie in need of attention.  I'm gonna have to radio basecamp for help on my Elmo phone.  ELMO: Elmo love you so much!  Basecamp. Come in, basecamp.  Elmo your friend.  Elmo, we've got a man down.  I need you to connect me with search and rescue.  Please don't believe rumors about Elmo.  (DISTORTED): Just to be safe, Elmo play with you at least 500 yards  - from school or public park - I'm having trouble hearing you, Elmo.  - (STATIC NOISE) - Are you there?  Elmo? Elmo?  Hello? Dammit, I've lost basecamp.  Must be interference from that big storm coming.  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  Too dangerous to risk going for help now.  I think we're gonna have to wait it out, Stewie.  Just you and me, and the homeless people  who live and copulate in the playground among children.  Yes, we as a society have clearly just decided  we're gonna roll with that.  (PETER SNIFFS)  Peter, what are you doing?  Well, you know how you told me to give up the '80s  and find a whole different decade to be into?  - No, that's not what I - Well, I'm doin' the 1920s!  Not 'cause of legal cocaine but mostly 'cause of legal cocaine.  (SNIFFS)  Time to design a very stupid flying contraption.  - (PLANE RATTLING) - Cocaine plane!  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  Um, why is Dad dressed like that now?  Oh, Lord, Peter, did you switch to the 1910s for silent movies?  (OLD-TIMEY MUSIC PLAYS)    (GROANS) Enough of this!  Oh, you are so damned exhausting, Peter!  Just 'cause you stop being crazy about one decade  doesn't mean you have to be crazy about another!  How about you just be a normal human being for once?!  Huh? Just be a Be a husband to your wife!  Be a father to your children!  You're right, Lois.  No matter how hard I try,  I'll never find a decade as good as the '80s,  like you just said just now.  No, again, that's not at all what I  I need to be alone.  If anyone calls, I'll be in the '70s  doing the might-as-well-be-legal cocaine.  ANNOUNCER: Cocaine: the winner of the war on drugs.  Thank you for taking care of me, Doug.  Look, Stewie, I want to apologize.  You do? For what?  For always showing you up and just being a jerk.  I think I'm just intimidated by your brilliance.  Plus, it's so great you've only got nine hairs.  It probably takes you three seconds to get ready in the morning.  Me, I've got this whole head of hair.  That's not quite as nice as you meant for it to sound,  but since we're confessing our insecurities  I'm not exactly the, um, I don't know,  ""slick cucumber"" everyone thinks I am.  - ""Slick cucumber""? - I mean, sure,  maybe on the outside, but I can only wish I had  - that slick cucumber deep inside - I'm getting lost, here, Stewie.  Like, sometimes I mention having  a supermodel girlfriend in Norway.  Well I I'm gonna be honest, um,  she's not a supermodel.  She's basically mid-level, at best.  Like, she's kind of a pocket client at some agencies,  but it's so political over there in Sweden.  Thought you said Norway.  Meanwhile, you're this cool kid on the block.  You're all confident. You can snap.  You mean this?  Yeah, that's like bloody witchcraft to me.  Anyway, deep down, I  I-I've always wanted your approval.  But now, tonight,  you've given me something much more valuable:  your friendship.  - Here. You can have it. - What?  I don't need the Frisbee anymore.  Take it, friend.    I won, everyone! I won!  Other kids, Stewie lost,  and he deserves our ridicule!  Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait!  DOUG: And there was a weird cucumber thing!  That son of a bitch.  Come back here! (GRUNTING)  Oh, you can do it, Stewie, for sure.  Free your foot, and together we will bump wieners.  But it's stuck, Norwegian Mid-Level Model Girlfriend.  Oh, just untie your shoe, is how.  Oh! Duh!  Stewie, when will you free me  from this thought bubble hell?  Not for a while.  I may need you if I run for office.  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  - Stewie! - You were manipulating me.  You were only being nice to get the Frisbee!  Sorry, Stewie, but all's fair in love and jungle gyms.  (GRUNTING)  (THUNDER RUMBLING)  Ha!  - Wh-Wh-Whoa! (SCREAMS) - Doug!  (SCREAMING)  Please hang on, Stewie!  I've got this, my friend.  This is when that slick cucumber deep inside of me comes out.  - Oh okay. - (PHONE RINGING)  You're gonna hate me, but I really need to take this.  Don't you dare!  But it might be Bruce Lee  finally calling to admit that I'm the best at kung fu!  - (LINE RINGING) - This is your one chance, Stewie.  I will not call you a second time.    Who am I if I can't reference the '80s?  If I can't live in the past, there's no future for me.  Boy, who knew when you stop doing cocaine,  - you get depressed? - MAN: Peter.  (GASPS) The ghost of '80s film director John Hughes?  Yes, Peter. I've come to tell you that Lois is right.  You need to let the '80s go.  But I don't understand.  Listen, when we were making art in the 1980s,  we were just having fun and trying new things.  Stop recreating the '80s, Peter.  They're gone.  Get out there and make your own '80s.  Today.    After all, life moves pretty fast.  If you don't stop and look around once in a while,  - you could miss it. - Ah! Like the movie!  I have to go, Peter.  - Goodbye. - Wait! Wait!  You want to know my favorite thing from any of your movies ever?  - Was it the giant pancake? - Yes, the giant pancake!  In heaven, are the pancakes big  like they are in Uncle Buck?  I wouldn't know, Peter.  I'm currently frying in hell.  What?! But-but you were pretty good.  You have to be very good!  Doug, I can't hold on much longer.  (GRUNTING)  It's been an honor, friend.  (BOTH CRY OUT)  Oh. W-We weren't we weren't very high up there.  No, I guess it just seemed higher to us,  because of perspective and what-have-you.  At any rate Hey, gang? Gang!  Here's your Frisbee.  Stewie and I got it  - together. - Yes. Together.  We're different kids from before,  so that means nothing to us.  - We had quite the adventure. - Yes, we did.  And at the end of it all, I, uh  I hope we've come to see each other  through slightly different eyes.  We certainly have.  Hey, who knows?  Maybe someday they'll make a movie about us.  ANNOUNCER: This summer, don't miss Jungle Gym Mountain,  starring Chris Pine as Doug  - What? - and Paul Giamatti as Stewie.  Come on!  Help. I crapped my pants,  and I'm afraid of heights.  I'm out of here.  And Chris Hemsworth as Thought Bubble Girlfriend.  I'll give it a shot."

Butt-to-butt.  Hanes.  Planes.  (LAUGHING)  Whoo!  What the hell?  We must've accidentally grabbed the wrong ones at the laundromat.  Oh, so your boys were where his boys were.  And your boys were where his boys were.  BOTH: Oh, my God!  Hey, what are you guys talking about?  Peter and Quagmire exchanged underwear.  Ha! Classic!  Me, I don't wear underwear. I just wear trunks.  Tree guy.  That'll hit you when you're driving home.  Hey, look at this table. What are you guys talking about?  Oh, hey, I-I, uh  I didn't I didn't know you take out trash, too.  Yeah, I-I, uh Only on trash days.  No, right, of course. Yeah, no, no, I'm sorry. I-I  - (KICKS GROUND) - (SIGHS)  (CHUCKLES): I'm not sure what to say.  (CHUCKLES) I know. It's awkward.  I thought things would go back to normal  after we traded underwear yesterday.  (PLAYING ""TAPS"")  I'm gonna have Lois cancel our dinner plans  with you and Ida tomorrow. I-I think it's too soon.  Hey, you don't think the guys are talking about us, do you?  Oh, I don't think so.  Oh, my God.  I still can't believe they wore each other's underwear.  Like, can you imagine?  I know, right? Like, icky times a thousand.  Hey, this is crazy,  but what if we wore each other's underwear,  just for a joke?  What? No, that's a terrible idea.  Yeah, just-just joking.  So stupid!  Can I be done now?  (DOOR CREAKS)  Okay, you go in there, kill Miss T, and we'll sneak out the back.  You need a weapon or anything?  She's a cat, I'm a dog. I'm good.  - (BRIAN BARKING) - (RATTLING)  (MISS TIGGYWINKLES SNARLS)  (BRIAN GROWLING)  - (RATTLING STOPS) - (BRIAN GROWLS)  (MISS TIGGYWINKLES MEOWS)  (LOUD MEOW)  It went poorly.  Thanks again for having us over, Lois.  Zesty Italian? Oh, I-I just couldn't. Not this close to bedtime.  (WHISPERS): You said you were gonna cancel dinner.  (WHISPERS): I have zero control in my marriage.  Whoops. (CHUCKLES) I dropped my roll,  which is not at all an invitation for Peter  to have an under-the-table conference.  Ha! Darn thing's always coming off.  Excuse me for one moment, won't you?  Why did you do that?  You dropped all the bread. What was I supposed to do?  Okay, that makes sense.  So, I went to the underwear doctor and  you should probably get checked.  They say when you wear someone's underwear,  you're also wearing the underwear  of everyone whose underwear they've worn.  I can't believe this! I thought I knew you, Glenn Quagmire!  (CHUCKLES) Here I go again, filling up on ears.  What's going on here, you two? You're being very rude.  Lois spent all day overcooking this meal.  We accidentally wore each other's underwear.  (LAUGHING)  I can't believe you wore each other's undies!  (LAUGHS) This is hysterical!  - (BANGING ON WALL) - CHRIS: Shut! Up!  Oh, it's not even Wednesday!  CHRIS: It's Tuesday night! That's part of it!  Guys, this isn't funny!  Relax, Peter. It's no big deal.  You don't get it!  Oh, quit being so dramatic. Ladies switch underwear all the time.  I might be wearing Bonnie's right now. I don't even remember.  While that is super sexy and being stored for later,  it's very different for guys.  That's not true, male friends can be more intimate than they used to.  - BOTH: Nope! - And the lines of sexuality  - are more fluid than ever. - BOTH: Nope!  And people aren't so quick to judge or label.  Please stop.  Masculinity just doesn't account for stuff like this.  Look, guys can share laughs and beers,  but we don't share feelings, emotions, or underwear.  Between male friends, there's no coming back from this.  He's right. I'm afraid our relationship is on the skids.  Maybe there's hope for the future, but things now are too spotty.  I just don't know if there's any front-to-back to this.  Our reputations are smeared.  If I wasn't so yellow, maybe I'd push harder.  But, hey, we had a really good streak, huh?  What's going on out there, Dad?  We accidentally wore each other's underwear,  so Mr. Quagmire is moving.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, obviously one of you would need to.  Peter, this is completely ridiculous.  Babe. What's done is done.  Look, I don't have a lot of friends,  it's kind of a problem on the show.  But if I did, I would never let anything come between us,  especially a pair of underwear.  You know what, Lois? You're right.  Now go tell him not to move.          Quagmire,  I just want to say that you can wreck a good pair of underwear,  but you can't wreck a good friendship.  That's nice, Peter.  Underwear should never come between two friends.  Well, it kind of should.  (CHUCKLES): Yeah, yeah. It kind of should, yeah.  Will you help me move my stuff back inside?  Only if I can do it half naked and in front of all our neighbors.  Not my first choice, but okay.    Miss Tiggywinkles, wake up! You've got to get out of here!  Oh, my God, you're dead!  - (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS) - Well, what do we have here?  Stewie Griffin, cat murderer?  What? You psycho! You killed her?  Maybe I did, maybe she died of natural causes.  The only thing that matters is that now I have the goods on you.  Oh, that's a terrible photo. Would you mind doing it again?  (SHUTTER CLICKS)  Aw, yeah. That's cute. Can you send me that?  No.  Give me that picture!  Hey, Doug. Sorry about your kitty.  I guess the pet store didn't have a men's department, huh?  - Uh, well, I tried to get a - (SNORES THEN GROANS)  Hey, I don't want to be too tired to drive home.  Does this story have an ending?  Later, losers! I'm five!  (HORN HONKS)  - Who is that? - That's Tyler.  He's, uh, kind of my Doug.  Boy, we all get a Doug, huh?  Yeah, Tyler's Doug is a drunk stepdad.  - Yikes. - Yeah.  Well, I'm glad everyone's back in their regular underwear  and everything's back to normal.  Me, too. And thank you for cleaning the milking table.  Well, we had quite a week as well.  We sure did.  I mean, you got your ass kicked by a cat.  Well, it was really more of a draw.  Yeah, whatever.  Hey, you want to end the show with a ""To Be Continued"" meme?""  I-I don't even know what that  - (BAZOOKA CLICKS) - (LOUD BOOM)"

But, we gotta do this quick.  Right here against the wall.  Hey, Stewie, I wanted to apologize for last night  and also maybe charge my phone  What the hell?  Hello, Brian. If you're watching this,  it means you couldn't find your phone charger  and came in to use mine.  Man, am I that predictable?  Yes. Yes, you are.  Anyway, I can see that my disease has become a burden  to the people I love,  so I've decided to take a bus to Vermont  to have physician-assisted suicide.  - What? - I've left two suits in my closet,  and this is very important:  the black is for the wake,  the wool is for the 'Gram story.  Two suits, Bri. Two looks.  That's what people would expect of me.  Oh, my God. This is terrible.  Okay, don't look at the tags, that's tacky.  Well, I'm not telling you that, but not cheap.  I don't care about the suits!  Anyway, you were a good friend, Bri.  Oh, and if they make a movie about my life,  don't let Jim Carrey play me.  Unless he gets his eyes done.  Even then, though Ugh, hard maybe.  What have I done?  This is all my fault.  I drove my best friend away  and now he's alone and dying on a bus somewhere.  Oh, also, you can have my penis enlarging machine.  It's in my closet.  Ah!

I better hide.  Hey, Bon, did you know there's a difference  between Tenth Street and Tenth Avenue?  Anyway, I may have bonered the stakeout.  Aw, thanks for pre-chewing my meal, babe.  The food shuttles out of my cloaca much easier that way.  Time to let these dogs out of their cages.  Bon, would you turn on my foot fan?  I gotta create a distraction so I can get out of here.  Oh, God, Peter's texting me about going to the Clam.  That guy is getting insufferable.  And that dumb Shaquille O'Neal GIF!  It's like, we get it, it's humorous  for a man that large to act playful.  I thought so.  So, anyway, I'm gonna go dump all this  completely undigested food out of my bag,  into the toilet.  If I time it right and close my eyes,  it almost sounds like real diarrhea.  This can never happen again, Bonnie.  Time for a poignant, cinematic farewell.  I don't like when Bill Murray is serious.  Hang tight, Stewie, I'm coming.  Is that Is that Bernie Sanders?  Ha!  Goes to Vermont once.  Ah!

You saying I've been eatin' at Bonnie's?  Okay, fine, Lois! I've been eatin' dinner at Bonnie's!  I think we should have another baby.  That'll fix this.  Peter, I don't care.  You don't?  No, it's less food for me to make  and besides, you know,  these things happen in all marriages.  Now, if you'll excuse me,  I'm going to go into the other room  and sing Melissa Manchester's ""Don't Cry Out Loud.""  No! No! Stop it! Stop it! Nope! Nope! Can't afford it!  Well, what can we afford?  ""Black Betty"" by Ram Jam.  Whoa, Black Betty   Bam-ba-I am, whoa, Black Betty   Bam-ba-I am, Black Betty had a child   Bam-ba-I am, damn thing gone wild   Bam-ba-I am.   Almost done, Stewie.  Do you have an email address for our mailing list?  Uh, no thanks, I'm about to kill myself.  Stop the procedure!  Look Stewie, I know I've been hard on you,  but it's only because I've been  struggling with my own mortality.  What? But you're perfectly healthy.  Stewie, I celebrated my tenth birthday this week.  In dog years, I'm 70.  It's all I can think about.  That's the age people shrug at  when they see it in an obituary.  Wait, T. O., you're 70?  Do you get regular peels? You look great.  Yes, I've got a great gal, we'll talk.  The point is, I felt like my life was ending,  but I was wrong.  When I was driving up here to the clinic,  I saw the leaves change.  I tapped a maple tree and milked a cow.  I-I tried fresh cream for the first time  and went to a writer's retreat.  I met Margaret Atwood and we foraged for wild mushrooms.  Wow, sounds like you were in a real rush to get here.  The point is, I've got a lot of life left in me,  and so do you.  Easy for you to say.  You don't have a terminal illness.  Oh, for God's sake, you don't have  Brian, what are you doing? Don't touch that!  That's the infected Play-Doh!  Brian, no! Stop!  There. Now I have cooties, too.  And I don't care.  You you don't?  We all have cooties,  whether it's illness or loneliness or turning 70.  Nothing is promised.  We could get run over by a car.  Or struck by lightning.  We could be hit with an unprecedented pandemic  that the government is slow to recognize,  woefully unprepared for  and then mismanages with reckless incompetence.  But that's all the more reason  to appreciate the time we do have.  I mean, look around!  Look at this room. It's beautiful.  Bri, did you eat those mushrooms you found?  Yeah. You actually look like a very old witch right now.  But I'm also just happy to be alive  and you should be, too.  You know what? You're right, Brian.  Too bad you can never get that on the page,  but that's profound.  Hey, I changed my mind.  I don't want to do the procedure.  My life isn't over.  Why, I've only just begun.  Stop it! Nope! Nope! Nope! Can't afford it!  Well, what can we afford?  Whoa, Black Betty, bam-ba-I am   Whoa, Black Betty, bam-ba-I am   Black Betty had a child, bam-ba-I am   Damn thing gone wild, bam-ba-I am.   Yeah, you, first question. Go ahead.  Meg was noticeably absent from the episode.  - Was that a team decision or - Yeah, I'm not going to be  answering any questions about Meg.  We'll be dealing with Meg internally.  - Over here. - Do you think  we'll be seeing more of Peter and Bonnie teaming up?  I thought it played pretty well.  Uh, we'll have to look at the tape on that  and, uh, make a decision moving forward. Yeah.  You guys used to be on at 9:00,  now you're on at 9:30. What happened with that?  All right, I'm done here.  This suit cost $40,000  and I'm throwing it away after this press conference.  Okay, over here?"

We try not to talk about it.  Some rich guy in Rhode Island.

(LAUGHS)  This may be one of my ocular migraines talking,  but I see fireworks.  Can I ask, is that licorice on your breath,  or is that just my licorice breath  bouncing out of your mouth?  Why don't you get in here and find out?  (MOANING SOFTLY)  (BRAKES SQUEAL)  Wha Oh, are we home?  Why aren't we going up the driveway?  Come on. I have to show you something first.    (GASPS)    - Daddy, what is this? - It's yours.  I had to call in a favor or two, but it's all for you.  I figured you can come here to sit whenever you miss Meredith.  Daddy, this is beautiful.  I'm sorry, Lois.  You were right, people you love can betray you.  But if they're rich enough, they can buy apology ponds.  Thank you, Daddy.  (PHONE CHIMES AND BUZZES)  Oh, no, Rafael, the old gardener, died.  I have a story I have to tell you  and, spoiler alert, you'll be getting another pond.  Well, Dad, I guess our hotel worked out,  and we actually made a decent profit.  We sure did, son, but we still got work to do.  Hi, everybody, I'm your karaoke host, Peter Griffin.  I will be up here far too many times tonight.  Just a quick reminder to all of you  that even though we haven't started yet,  there's already an hour and 45-minute wait.  So go ahead and write down the song you want to sing,  hand it to me, and I will let  15 musical theater people go before you.  Remember, no repeats.  We want to give everybody a chance to sing,  although there will be the same rotation of five people up here  over and over doing duets.  All right, who's ready for me to kick things off  and then go third and sixth?"

			Aw, why aren't we doing that?

			- Right, who are both named Jim.
			- Good morning, my darling.
			- Hello, my love.
			Keep in mind

			So a strained family dynamic

			Wow, what a beautiful,

			Yeah, no. What's up is down here, bro.
			Oh, hi, you must be our new neighbors.
			I'm Carolyn Burnham,
			RE/MAX's top crying realtor in the area.
			Uh, thanks, but we just bought a house,
			so we don't really need a realtor.
			- You don't?
			- S-Sorry.
			It's okay. You know what?
			We'll buy another one.
			Oh, great. Great.
			Oh, looks like your son and my daughter
			are getting to know each other.
			Check out this video I took
			of a plastic bag.
			I'm thinking about sending it in
			to America's Funniest Home Videos.
			Really? Do you think it's funny enough?
			I don't know.
			I just want to spend $2,000
			flying to Los Angeles
			to maybe win $1,000.
			That's halftime.
			And now, please welcome
			the Suburbia High School
			cheer quad, the Dockers Zipper Pushers.
			Who is that?
			Ah! Ah, damn it! Ah, stop. Stop.
			I have seasonal allergies, guys.
			All right.
			Now the marching band to play
			the Suburbia High School fight song.
			Geez, again with this song?
			Shut up and kiss me, other gay Jim.
			Oh, no. No.
			I'm very against that.
			Remember that for later.
			The next day, I quit my job
			and was in no way
			run out of the industry
			for groping a busboy in Nantucket.
			It was a joke. I was razzing the guy.
			Come on.
			I got a new job at a fake movie
			fast food restaurant.
			God, why are movies so bad
			at naming restaurants?
			Welcome to Mr. Smiley's
			BurgerTownVilleLand.
			Would you like to try a Large McIntyre?
			Yes, my lover and I
			will each have adultery burgers.
			Second window.
			- Two adultery burgers.
			- Lester!
			Listen, let's not make a big scene here.
			We can talk about this when we get
			You don't get to tell me
			what to do anymore.
			We need more ketchup.
			All right, there are some things
			you can tell me to do.
			After that, I started
			lifting weights in my garage.
			But I lost track of a spider
			that crawled behind the heavy ones,
			so I had to use the dainty
			weights ladies walk with.
			Oh, hey. You got those drugs?
			Yep, right here.
			Oh, my God.
			Look at that plastic bag.
			So beautiful.
			Do you do a lot of the drugs yourself?
			I do, yes.
			Okay, let me just get on my knees
			and roll a joint at crotch level
			like all drug dealers do.
			Great, and I'll just lean back,
			away from the drugs
			like all drug users do.
			What the hell?
			Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?
			Help me out here, Mr. Furley.
			How did this thing win an Oscar?
			It's basically Austin Powers.
			Yo, yo, check this out.
			What if, like, Kramer is just
			a figment of Jerry's imagination?
			- Wow. Yeah.
			- 'Cause think about it.
			We-we never see him interacting
			with anyone else.
			Yeah.
			- Well-well, wait. I mean
			- we-we do.
			Oh, boy, am I glad you're here.
			I don't think I like what I saw earlier.
			Oh, was it The Phantom Menace,
			which also came out this same year?
			Yeah, what a mess.
			Ricky, go on home.
			I need to talk to Lester.
			Aw, I don't want to.
			There's plastic bags.
			There are?
			Hey, you know how there's
			two things we know for sure?
			We'll always be able to
			bring box cutters on planes,
			- and I'm heterosexual?
			- Yeah, of course.
			Well, turns out only one of
			those things is true.
			Mm
			Look, I think I gave you the wrong idea
			with these pink weights and
			pantomiming oral with your son.
			- I'm straight.
			- I'm so sorry!
			I got to go start a megachurch!
			Eh, seems right.
			Oh, hey, what are you doing here?
			I have a flight tomorrow,
			and Jane said I could borrow
			your box cutter.
			Man, I love cutting boxes on planes.
			And also and this is kind of
			embarrassing and unearned
			But I think you're sexy,
			and I want to have sex with you.
			Ah, sweet! Let's do this!
			I should let you know, I'm a virgin.
			Not a deal-breaker.
			And I should let you know
			I'm Chris Hansen
			from To Catch a Predator.
			Aw, crap. Somebody shoot me.
			Sorry, I didn't mean to
			Whoa, you're Chris Hansen!
			Hey, what do you do with all
			the leftover pedophile pizza?
			Well, that was American Beauty.
			See you at the Oscars.
			I'll be there with my mom.
			That's not a big, obvious sign
			of something, right?
			- How's work, Ralph?
			- It's a breeze.
			- Give my best to Judy.
			- Will do.
			Hi, my name's Forrest.
			Forrest Gump.
			Would it be okay
			if I sugarcoat race relations
			in the South for
			the next two and a half hours?
			Honey, I'm a Black woman
			in a '90s Hollywood movie,
			- that's what I'm here for.
			- Great.
			My mama always said life was
			like a box of Good & Plenty:
			most people just throw it away.
			One day on the bus to school,
			I met Jenny.
			She was the love of my life.
			Hey, look, it's a guy
			with nonstandard legs.
			Let's bully and
			throw rocks at him and not me.
			Run, Forrest, run!
			And in a magical moment
			whose explanation
			I assume was cut for time,
			I could suddenly run very fast.
			But I happened to do it
			in front of the meanest
			lifeguard in Alabama.
			- No running!
			- It's for a movie. God.
			I was such a fast runner,
			I went on to play
			college movie football,
			where all the tacklers dive
			two feet behind you and miss.
			After I graduated,
			I joined the Army
			and got shipped off to war.
			Vietnam is where I met
			my best friend, Bubba,
			who really wanted to have
			his own squid fishing boat.
			In fact, he knew just about
			everything you could do with a squid.
			Well, there's calamari
			That's about it.
			Ambush!
			Oh, my God, Lieutenant Dan!
			Damn it, save yourself, Gump.
			- Leave me here.
			- All right.
			Bubba was also shot.
			And as always happens
			when a soldier dies,
			we discussed business ideas.
			I'm dying, Forrest.
			I want you to buy
			a squid boat in my honor.
			How about a gym
			exclusively for big white women?
			- There could be machines that
			- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
			You had me at ""big white women.""
			After I got home from Vietnam,
			I got to speak at a generic protest.
			There's only one thing
			to say about Vietnam:
			I had this awesome red stuff
			on all my food.
			I don't 'member what it's called.
			It's not hot sauce,
			but it's not ketchup.
			I think it's got a rooster on the label.
			Forrest!
			Jenny!
			Aah! Son of a bitch!
			See, guys? This is why no running.
			And then I know,
			it's still not over yet
			I bought a squid boat.
			Lieutenant Dan was also working with me.
			And you know
			who's super helpful on a boat
			that's constantly rocking in the water?
			A wheelchair guy.
			Hey, Forrest, I got our lunches.
			So after I was rich,
			Jenny came back
			and had sex with me one time.
			Wow, that was great.
			Sorry I was naming presidents during.
			So, we getting married or what?
			You don't want to marry me, Forrest.
			Yeah, you're right.
			Okay, well, have a good night.
			And then, shockingly late in the movie,
			I started running again.
			Like, across the country.
			Several times.
			The whole sequence
			is a full eight minutes.
			I mean, sometimes this whole
			movie feels like it was written
			by a seven-year-old
			who just ate a bunch of candy.
			But I checked, it's just a regular guy.
			Anyway, at least we were finally
			to the time in our nation's history
			when I could listen to this.
			Princes, princes who adore you. ♪
			Forrest!
			I brought you chocolates
			picked over by strangers.
			Forrest, I'm sick.
			Sick? With what?
			Oh, I did a movie about that once.
			It's called Splash.
			No, Forrest.
			Oh, I thought you said mermaids.
			But I did a movie about your thing, too.
			But that's not all.
			I want you to meet my son.
			Six hours in makeup. One line.
			You're his father.
			Father?
			Is he like me?
			Uhp, you died.
			And feather!"

			Hi, normal lady.
			What are you guys doing? It's Sunday.
			I thought husbands had to watch

			Today's our family fun day.
			That's right, a whole day
			dedicated to family and fun,
			ending in the bedroom
			with what I hope will be
			some back-end participation.
			- Hmm?
			- Mm-mm.
			I am so tired of this family
			just sitting around and doing nothing.
			The Browns are outside having
			fun while we're in here loafing around
			like a bunch of stupid potatoes.
			Mom, I've been anonymously
			cyberbullied for a decade.
			""Stupid potato"" doesn't even
			leave a mark.
			We need to spend some quality
			time together like the Browns.
			So we're doing a family fun day.
			Oh, family-free fun day sounds great.
			No, family fun day.
			Yeah, family-free fun day.
			No, Peter. Family. Fun. Day.
			Yeah, I'm already at The Clam. Have fun.
			All right, nothing's more fun
			than a family card game.
			Now, the game is euchre.
			""Begin by separating the nines,
			tens, face cards and aces
			""from the rest of the deck.
			""The goal is to win at least
			three 'tricks.'
			""Now, if the side that fixed
			the trump fails
			""to get three tricks,
			it is said to be 'euchred.'
			""The highest trump is the jack
			of the trump suit,
			""called the 'right bower.'
			""Partnership-making trump wins
			three or four tricks
			""and earns one point.
			""Lone hand wins three or four tricks,
			""also earns one point.
			""However, a lone hand wins five tricks,
			""that's worth four points.
			Many euchre games are scored
			by rubber points, as in whist.""
			Ooh, ooh. ""The first side
			to win two games""
			""wins the rubber.""
			""The dealer has the right to exchange
			any turned-up card""
			Oh, my God, it's the same.
			""If the face-up card is a jack,
			""it's considered bad luck for""
			""After two rounds, if no
			trump suit has been declared
			""and the 'stick-the-dealer' rule
			is not in effect,
			then the cards are collected
			and reshuffled.""
			Family Guy is
			brought to you by contract bridge.
			Way simpler than euchre.
			You see, in contract bridge,
			each player is dealt 13 cards
			from a standard 52-card deck.
			A trick starts when a player leads,
			i.e. plays the first card.
			The leader to the first trick
			is determined by the auction.
			So, what do you think, gang?
			I thought it could be
			a fun family activity
			if we had a make-your-own-pizza night.
			Or we could order Domino's.
			No, come on, this'll be fun.
			Everyone gets their own crust,
			and you can choose from any
			of the items I put out, huh?
			It could be olives, it could be peppers.
			And for the risk takers, I even
			put out some pineapple.
			You can put anything you want
			on your pizza.
			Yeah, I'm putting a Domino's
			pizza on my pizza.
			Domino's we're both
			terrible and better than your pizza.
			Ah, this is nice, huh?
			Oh, it's so good to get the whole family
			out of the house and see Quahog
			from a different perspective.
			It's a little tight.
			So, how'd you get
			into hot-air ballooning?
			They don't do background checks.
			Oh. What are we flying over now?
			My ex-wife's house.
			If you have any garbage
			or little bags of cat poo,
			you can drop them now.
			Did you know restraining orders
			only go side to side?
			They don't go up and down.
			Well, there's got to be
			one thing we can all
			enjoy together as a family.
			You know, I think we're trying too hard.
			When I was a kid we did movie nights,
			and it was the Holy Grail of family fun.
			- I'd watch a movie
			- I'd watch a porn movie.
			No, a family movie.
			I'd watch a MILF porn movie.
			Okay, technically
			that's accurate, but no porn.
			All right, let's fire up
			Amazon or Netflix.
			No streaming services.
			They've ruined how we watch movies.
			I'm talking about
			an old-school movie night
			where we rent one from Blockbuster.
			Some of my best
			childhood memories were when
			I went to rent a video with my dad.
			Him and I never really got along,
			but the one place where we did
			was Blockbuster.
			He'd let me pick out any snack I wanted
			while he grabbed our fifth-choice movie
			because we got there too late
			to get the good ones.
			But that was part of it,
			because it wasn't about the movie,
			it was about the night
			you spent together.
			I think renting a movie's a great idea.
			Let's do it.
			So it's settled.
			The Griffins are making it
			a Blockbuster night.
			When we get there,
			I'll give you 20 bucks to say,
			""I've heard Magic Mike is good.""
			Huh. This used to be the Blockbuster.
			Oh, man, it's gone.
			Were you also looking for
			Very tall prostitute, yes.
			Is that what you were going to say?
			She used to hang out here
			Hands like a palm leaf.
			She would do sex but also help
			with light bulbs and stuff.
			I think her name was Phillip.
			I see some of my students in your car.
			That's good for me.
			I'm sure there's one still open.
			I'll just google it.
			Eh, I got to type in my code
			'cause I got too fat
			- for the facial recognition to work.
			- Brutal.
			Oh, good. See? There is one still open.
			Drive north for a quarter of a mile,
			then turn left onto Highway 20.
			Continue straight for 2,980 miles.
			- What?!
			- Oh, yeah.
			The last Blockbuster in existence
			is in Bend, Oregon.
			Did I not say that? Strap in, everybody,
			the Griffins are going on a road trip.
			Well, it looks like the family Griffin
			is headed off down Holiday Road.
			And Lindsey Buckingham has said no.
			Well, that's all right.
			I reckon, if you're a man named Lindsey,
			you don't get to call
			the shots very often.
			Peter, this is crazy.
			We can't drive 3,000 miles
			just to rent a movie.
			Would you please turn around?
			Lois, the whole family fun thing
			was your idea.
			Don't get mad at me
			'cause I'm following through.
			But I only have one pair of underwear.
			Oh, that's not a problem. I got tons of
			women's underwear in the back.
			Why, why do you have that?
			Tons of it.
			Don't we have a say in all this, Dad?
			Yeah, we don't want to drive
			all the way to Oregon.
			Aw, it's gonna be fun, guys.
			We're gonna see the whole country,
			like we're in one of those
			Bruce Springsteen Jeep commercials.
			America is made up of a lot of states.
			Some of them really stink,
			but some of them don't stink.
			So buy a Jeep.
			They flip easy, but you'll be okay.
			Probably be okay.
			One of the perks of a cross-country trip
			is stopping for a meal
			and meeting the friendly folks
			who make up the heart and soul
			of our country.
			Hello, we're from the Northeast.
			Okay, then.
			We'll do 55 pancakes to go.
			Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump.
			- Trump.
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump! Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			- Trump!
			I'm not getting any service.
			- Where are we?
			- Hey, I don't know.
			But we can figure it out
			by which radio stations come in.
			You're listening to G-U-N-S AM radio.
			All guns all the time.
			Is the caller there?
			Ha, ha, I couldn't agree more.
			Sounds like we're somewhere
			between Washington and Washington.
			Well, we got to almost be there, right?
			A few more hours.
			Trust me, it'll all be worth it
			once we walk into that store.
			Plus, I'll be able to finally return
			this copy of Ladyhawke.
			You remembered to rewind that, right?
			You know what I'm thinking, Peter?
			Instead of going to Blockbuster,
			we drive right into
			the first pond we see.
			It'll be a quicker death than this trip.
			Guys, look.
			Ah! Oh, my God, it's real.
			We made it.
			Well, I suppose I should be
			the responsible one
			and release all the car farts.
			You're free now. Go.
			I said go!
			Here it is, guys.
			This is where kids would come
			every Friday night
			and see their teacher wearing jeans.
			Dad, who's Christian Slater?
			Some actors never made it
			out of Blockbuster, Chris.
			Sliver. Fun movie.
			Yeah, it's Sharon Stone, so it's nudity
			moms will put up with.
			Hmm, it looks like you have
			a late fee for Ladyhawke.
			Ah, no problem. How much is it?
			$32,419.
			Look, uh, we traveled
			a really long way to get here,
			and I kind of promised
			my family a movie night.
			Oh. Then the plot just got interesting.
			Where are you on your journey?
			About the end of act two?
			I read a lot of screenplay books.
			There's got to be some way
			we can work this out.
			Sorry, but we're pretty strict
			about our late fees.
			We kind of blew up our
			whole company for 'em.
			So, no money, no rental.
			Uh, $32,000, you say?
			I don't have that on my person.
			Hands ♪
			Touching hands ♪
			Reaching out ♪
			Touching me ♪
			Touching you. ♪
			Ah, here it comes. All together now
			Drive, Lois, drive!
			Nothing worse than a case
			of Neil Diamond blue balls. Am I right?
			Peter, just pull over.
			We can talk to them and figure this out.
			No. A high-speed chase is preferred
			over small talk with an employee. Aah!
			I hear Magic Mike is good.
			Way too late, dude.
			I can lose these guys.
			Chris, pour me out a handful
			of those Runts.
			How's eating candy gonna help us?
			Runts are the hardest candy
			in the world.
			They're not for eating,
			they're for hucking.
			Meg, there's a stack of posters
			in the back.
			We can throw 'em out the car
			and blind 'em.
			Just run the posters by me first.
			- Judge Dredd?
			- Nah, keep that one.
			I want to put it in the basement.
			- Cool World?
			- Keep.
			- Milk Money?
			- Uh, keep.
			These are all terrible movies.
			Just throw one out.
			You know, that movie still holds up.
			It didn't hold up then.
			It worked. We lost them.
			Yes! No one ruins
			a Griffin family fun day.
			Who wants a turnaround high five?
			Dad, watch the road!
			Is everyone okay?
			I swallowed my retainer,
			but I'll do a little
			stool fishing later.
			Oh, they're still after us.
			We got to run.
			Give up. We got you. It's over.
			Well, actually it's not.
			I think this might be
			the ""all is lost"" moment.
			- What?
			- You know, it seems over
			because there's an
			insurmountable obstacle
			in their way, but instead of giving up,
			they double down.
			- Lois, we got to jump.
			- See?
			The fall will kill us.
			I've seen Rambo jump from higher.
			I think if we jump
			it'll cut to that scene.
			Peter, that's crazy.
			Do you trust me?
			No!
			Oh, what the hell?
			- I told you.
			- I know.
			Peter Griffin, PhD. Petty, heavy dope.
			Wow, she really had that
			locked and loaded.
			This is crazy.
			Those guys are trying to kill us
			because of a late movie.
			We should just call the police.
			Oh, look who's already walking back
			their ""Defund the Police"" stance.
			Little different when it's real life
			and not trying to impress
			Alyssa Milano on Twitter. Hmm?
			Oh, this is not good.
			It's gonna get dark soon.
			- We need a plan.
			- Don't worry.
			We can hike back to the car
			and call for help from the road.
			We're gonna get through this.
			Now, before we head off,
			I'm gonna divvy out our rations.
			I'll start with this pack of Starbursts.
			There's pink for you,
			orange for you, red for me,
			yellow for you, pink for you,
			red for me
			You keep giving yourself all the reds.
			It's just completely random.
			I'm just going in order.
			I can't help where I'm standing.
			Okay, where was I? Yellow for Chris,
			- red for me
			- You did it again.
			Okay, y-you know, I tried being fair,
			but now I'm just gonna
			lick all the reds.
			Now they have to be mine.
			Next food Spree.
			Green for you, orange for you,
			red for me!
			I think we're lost.
			We're gonna die out here.
			Guys, we can't give up now.
			We can and I shall.
			I'm gonna close my eyes
			and go to my happy place,
			being screamed at by children
			while playing Fortnite.
			No, your mom's a whore.
			Wait, guys, look.
			I think I see a cabin.
			It is a cabin. We're saved.
			You can't say that word, Brayden.
			None of you can say that word.
			Look, there's a radio. We can
			Watch Sliver on that VCR.
			What? No. We need to call for help.
			We can do both.
			I am not gonna give up
			on this movie night
			like we gave up on our marriage.
			Four therapy sessions is enough
			to know where it's headed.
			There's a map on the wall
			with government buildings
			connected by strings.
			Look, I know this hasn't been
			the easiest couple of days, guys,
			but it'll all be worth it
			once I put this tape in.
			I present to you Sliver.
			And it's Sliders, season two.
			Classic Blockbuster blunder.
			Oh, good. You numbskulls put
			the wrong movie in here.
			I want a refund.
			Everybody outside now.
			I can't believe this.
			All I was trying to do was
			have a nice movie night
			with my family, and you guys
			keep ruining it.
			Wow, this is very similar
			to a screenplay I wrote.
			This guy is too into movies.
			Remember, the one I had you read
			that was like Love Actually
			meets Independence Day?
			Uh, yeah, sure, I remember.
			- You didn't read it?
			- I'm gonna.
			Don't be mad at me.
			Be mad at, you know, these guys.
			I'm sorry, kids, all I wanted to do
			was something special with you guys.
			That one thing you'd remember
			doing with me
			for the rest of your lives,
			but I failed.
			Another failure in
			a long string of failures.
			Are you kidding, Dad?
			This has been the
			most exciting day ever.
			It has?
			Yeah. We left the house
			three days ago to rent a movie
			and now we're in the middle
			of the woods in Oregon
			and might get murdered
			by Blockbuster guys.
			Like, what is this?
			Yeah, we never know
			what you're gonna do.
			It's usually silly or dangerous,
			but it's also kind of awesome.
			Yeah. Remember when he had tiny arms
			- for, like, three months?
			- Or when he brought home that horse.
			Or that falcon. Or that parrot.
			Lot of illegal animals.
			Or when that little guy
			lived in his neck.
			What the hell was that?
			Every few years
			he fights a giant chicken
			and destroys a city.
			No one's named a good thing yet.
			You had a blimp with your face on it.
			Your mother put me on pills
			after I bought that.
			You see, Dad, we don't need a
			movie night for us to remember you.
			Every day is like
			a movie night with you.
			Well, I guess Mom knew
			what she was doing
			when she insisted on family fun day.
			Super sweet moment, guys.
			I'm gonna assume this was all a callback
			to something in act one.
			Time to go outside now.
			Guys, please, I'm the one
			with the late fees.
			Don't hurt my family. I'll do anything.
			Well, I have this screenplay,
			it-it's an epic sci-fi,
			and it's mostly stage directions
			where they
			Just kill us!
			What the hell?!
			Amazon drones? You saved us.
			Once again a streaming service
			annihilates a Blockbuster.
			Wa-boosh.
			How did you even know we were here?
			Based on your recent purchases,
			viewing habits and stored data,
			we determined that you were being chased
			through the wilderness by the last two
			Blockbuster employees on Earth.
			Wow. Scary.
			I owe you an apology, Amazon.
			You're a pretty amazing service
			after all.
			Yes, I agree. Amazon
			workers should not unionize.
			I-I didn't I didn't say that.
			Well, they sure can play dumb
			when they want to.
			Please stop spying on us, Alexa.
			Okay. Playing holiday music now.
			And since we've no place to go ♪
			Let it snow, let it ♪
			Snow, let it snow ♪
			Well, that Blockbuster adventure
			sure was fun,
			but we should probably just watch movies
			at home from now on.
			You know, Dad,
			while we were flying home,
			I did order something special for you.
			Sliver! We can still do
			our old-school movie night.
			I'll hook up the VCR.
			Aw, damn it, we can't watch it.
			I don't have the right adaptor cable.
			The last Circuit City in the U.S.
			is in St. Augustine, Florida.
			Let's go.
			I'll start the car.
			Looks like the Griffins are at it again.
			Hi, I'm Jeff Bezos,
			and I'm rich and bald.
			Guess which one matters. Good night."

			Damn it. I'll teach Joe to ogle my wife.
			Oh, hey, Peter.
			What are you clenching
			in that fist there?
			- (GRUNTS)
			- (GROANS)
			Well, that was sadder
			than what I was going for.
			Well, least it's over.
			Oh, God, those are all
			""final notice"" wheelchair bills.
			Not a good day for Joe.
			Not a good day for Joe.
			Peter, this is insane.
			I can't believe you would
			beat up your own friend.
			Well, can you blame me?
			After the sick show
			you two were putting on out there?
			Fine, Peter.
			So what if I was putting on a show?
			At least someone was in the audience.
			And maybe ask yourself why
			I'd even feel I have to do that.
			I come out of the bathroom
			in my underwear last night
			and all you want to do
			is look at James Cromwell.
			It was weird. He had most of his hair.
			You don't find me attractive anymore.
			Oh, come on, it's not you it's time.
			After all these years of marriage,
			your naked body has pretty much
			no effect on me anymore.
			It's basically like staring
			at a chair from the DMV.
			Well, sue me for trying
			to help reignite the passion
			in another couple's marriage.
			I can't seem to do it in my own.
			That's not what you're doing.
			You're flaunting yourself
			in front of the whole neighborhood
			just to boost your own ego.
			(SIGHS) All right, Peter,
			I'll be honest with you.
			We're moving again, 'cause of the Army?
			What? No. We're talking about Joe.
			Oh, right. We're moving again
			'cause Joe's in the Army.
			- (GROANS)
			- I don't want to move to Omaha.
			My friends are here.
			What is this?
			What do you think you're doing?
			Not that it's any
			of your business, Lois,
			but I'm fighting fire with fire.
			Now, if you need me,
			I'll be chopping wood out front
			when all the stroller moms go by.
			♪
			Oh.
			- That's right, ladies.
			- Oh, my.
			- (GASPS) Oh.
			- I'll be here all morning,
			turning small pieces of wood
			into even smaller pieces of wood
			for no reason.
			Okay, so, for purposes of the claim,
			what was the cause of the accident?
			Yeah, I don't know how that thing broke.
			Well, I see your neighbor
			has a Nest camera.
			That was from a previous attempt.
			I thought I looked hot,
			but then the paperboy laughed.
			Un-Unless you think it worked?
			Sir, I'm just trying to find out
			what happened with the window
			and head home to eat a Runeberg torte,
			a dessert from Finland.
			Oh, yes. Named after
			the Finnish national poet,
			Johan Ludvig Runeberg.
			ANNOUNCER: We kind

			on those countries up there.
			Okay. Any better?
			(SNIFFS) Well, now I just smell
			Febreze and vomit.
			Stupid dog.
			Seems like having a car is a real pain.
			God, it's the wors I mean, no way.
			Having a car is a dream.
			And having an expensive car
			you're constantly terrified
			about getting dinged or dirtied
			That's, like, the best thing

			Uhp, text from Brian.
			""Let me know
			if you're going on a Tums run.""
			Ugh, so passive-aggressive.
			""Do you need Tums?""
			(SIGHS) All right, Chris,
			as long as I'm going,
			do you need anything?
			Well, if you're going on a Desenex run,
			I wouldn't say no.
			Do you need Desenex?
			Only if you're going on a run.
			(CHUCKLES): Hey, Joe.
			I was wondering if you needed
			to borrow a cup of sugar.
			No, thanks, Lois.
			And, also, that's not how
			the sugar thing usually works.
			Well, I just
			Lois, you can stop
			with the phony excuses.
			I know why you've been doing
			what you're doing,
			and I think it's better if you stop.
			But, Joe, I just
			Look, I've given this
			tremendous thought,
			wondering if the reason
			I became so excited
			by all that's happened
			is that Peter's a good friend
			and perhaps the affection you two share
			was briefly channeled towards me
			as a reminder and renewal
			of the importance
			of maintaining a deep sense of
			wonder and curiosity about life.
			But then I realized it was
			mostly about seeing side-boob
			that was not my wife's side-boob.
			It just has to be different.
			I can't stress that enough.
			But-but I'm okay with that, Joe.
			Sorry, Lois. I can't do this to Peter.
			But please know that you
			have done a great service
			for my and Bonnie's sex life.
			Oh, I understand.
			Bye, Joe.
			- Say, Lois.
			- Yes?
			You're not going on a catheter
			run, by any chance, are you?
			Do you need me to get you catheters?
			Only if you're going on a run.
			Stop kicking my seat!
			That's it! If I have to stop this car,

			Rupert, talk to me!
			How many fingers am I holding up?
			Two? No, it's three.
			Okay, the thumb isn't a finger
			You're right.
			So glad you're okay to point that out.
			Still, I thought I'd lost you.
			Oh, this car has brought me
			nothing but trouble.
			Well, there's only one thing to do.
			I don't know.
			I just parked it on the street,
			and when I woke up this morning,
			it was gone.
			Well, this Nest camera footage shows you
			dousing it in gasoline
			and setting it ablaze.
			I have Nest Cam footage of you
			pleasuring yourself in our hedges.
			Is a check okay?
			Yeah, I did a good thing
			for Joe and Bonnie's marriage.
			It's not about me, it's about them.
			And if I could do it for Joe
			I can do it for a whole hospital wing
			of disabled veterans.
			Lois Griffin, reporting for duty.
			What possessed you
			to impersonate a nurse
			and give seven addled Korean War

			I'm a sexually desirable woman!
			Peter? Wh-What are you doing here?
			I smushed my thing up against
			the glass of a Lululemon.
			I'm really sorry for
			all the stuff I said earlier.
			Oh, me, too.
			It's just, after all
			these years, when I look at you,
			all I see is dealing with the kids,
			figuring out meals,
			going through the mail.
			It's great that Joe could see
			you like you used to be,
			but, for me, it's getting harder.
			No, it's my fault, too.
			I've taken us for granted,
			a-and it felt so nice to be seen
			as the person I used to think I was.
			Truth is, eventually,
			I'd probably get bored with any woman.
			Might as well get bored
			with the woman I love.
			Well, I can sit here and tell you today
			I'm as bored with you as I've ever been.
			I love you.
			I love you, too, Lois.
			- (GASPS) Oh!
			- Wow.
			You know, I've never seen you
			in a nurse's outfit before.
			(CHUCKLES): And I've
			never seen you dressed as
			Prom Night Tarzan?
			I'm a Chippendales dancer.
			Oh, Chippendales.
			I know they have a big cover charge.
			How much is the uncover charge?
			For you, it's $35,
			'cause you didn't bring enough people
			to qualify for the group rate,
			but it does include
			a $12 bottle of Costco champagne
			that we're gonna tell you is worth $100.
			Why? But Peter, you're bad at this.
			No, no, you argue back
			and then we get all hot.
			I'm raising two children alone
			in a single apartment.
			Okay, I'm back in.
			Boy, you really made
			some mistakes in your life,

			(MOANING)
			Uh, there's someone else in here.
			- Oh, my God!
			- What the hell?
			Principal Shepherd? You're in here, too?
			Yeah, I got into a slap fight

			because they wouldn't turn on Fox News.
			Y-You know what,

			Ah, look at this, Peter,
			a new restaurant in town.
			What a lightning bolt to the balls
			for a couple of schmoes like us, huh?
			I know, I can't believe Quahog
			finally got a His and Hers.
			Check it out: I can drink beer,
			watch sports, and play Pop-A-Shot
			right here at the table.
			And I can drink wine and scroll
			through Bonnie's Facebook,
			secretly enjoying
			that she has an ugly baby.
			Look at that thing's eyes.
			You know, maybe one glass
			a night wasn't fine.
			Hey, folks. We ready to order?
			I think so.
			Shall I cover your ears
			for your wife's menu questions?
			That'd be great.
			Yeah, are you able to do the salmon
			but without the dill cream?
			Sorry, no substitutions.
			We're a dick restaurant.
			Hmm. Then I'll have
			the fettuccine Alfredo.
			And my Instagram will have
			the watercress salad.
			And for you, sir?
			How much is that tomahawk rib eye?
			- $85
			- Kid's personal pan pizza.
			Great, and if you folks need
			anything else,
			I'll be invisible.
			Remember this, Peter? Remember us?
			I do remember us. I miss us.
			When we get home, let's do it
			so loud, the kids wake up.
			Yeah, let's do it on the couch
			where we all gather as a family
			and watch television.
			Family Guy is
			brought to you by Parent Sex.
			Parent Sex: It happens in rooms
			that you hang out in and watch TV.
			Maybe even right there
			where you're sitting now.
			Pretty gross, right?
			Gentlemen, we have work to do.
			Son of a bitch.
			Just when I'm onto
			something good, really good.
			Hey, what the hell's going on out here?
			You got a permit, pal? Huh?
			Hey, guys, I'll be right back.
			I'm just gonna toss this dog
			a beating real quick.
			Wait, what?
			Easy there, Gussy, I know this guy.
			Why don't you go get
			yourself a sandwich?
			Can-can I leave the wrappers
			in the bushes?
			All right, you can leave
			the wrappers in the bushes.
			Guys, he said we can.
			Stewie, what's happening?
			I'm trying to write,
			and all I hear is banging.
			Oh, yeah, check it out.
			I'm having these guys
			put up a tree house.
			Sort of like a man cave/dance
			studio kind of deal.
			Why don't you stop by later
			and I'll give you the tour?
			- Tell Chris, too.
			- Sure, I'm free.
			- Is that Lois's sweater?
			- Cardigans are unisex.
			So, Loey, how was the big date night?
			Wonderful date night.
			Great, great, great.
			Yeah, I'm still not
			not completely sold on ""Loey.""
			So, tell us, tell us
			after you had dinner, how was the pork?
			Who is this bitch?
			Uh, it was good.
			Yeah, it was really nice.
			Oh, no, you're not
			getting off that easy.
			Oh, classic Loey trying
			to dodge the question.
			Seriously, who is this
			froggy little bitch?
			How come she's sitting with us?
			Now, about the sex, though,
			I just how do I put this?
			Let's just say Peter doesn't always
			Munchausen my proxy.
			What do you mean?
			Well, he doesn't always go to Australia.
			You know, the land down under.
			Oh
			He's just never liked it. I don't know.
			I-I guess it's not a requirement,
			but, yeah, I do like having the option.
			You know, Joe and I went to a

			She really helped us,

			I'm sorry.
			The six-year-old birthday party

			Oh, there they are. The boys.
			- Come on in, fellas.
			- Dang, Stewie.
			This is a legit little pad you got here.

			- I might have them look at it.
			- Oh, I-I didn't even notice.
			So, yeah, you know,
			pretty self-explanatory.

			Well, come by later.
			Maybe we can watch a movie or something.
			Wow, that's super generous

			This place is dope.
			You see that, Rupert, they like it.
			This place might just be my masterpiece.
			Okay, wow.
			What the hell was that?
			So we're on the same page?
			I thought I was nuts.
			- Brutal, right?
			- Oh, brutal.
			I have no idea
			what he's going for up there.
			That's the thing. I
			don't think he does either.
			I'm sorry, he wants us
			to come watch a movie up there?
			On a Vizio?
			Oh, is that what he was saying?
			I couldn't hear a word
			over those floorboards creaking.
			Oh, my God. Creak City.
			Poor guy. Just has no

			Like, dude, go to Costco,

			Oh, big surprise.
			Take her side, why don't you?
			Peter, let's take a breath.
			We're just here to talk.
			So, Lois tells me you don't like
			doing everything in the bedroom.
			Listen, if he's too shy
			to talk about this,
			we could always try hypnosis.
			Oh, how would that work?
			Well, we get him
			in a very relaxed state,
			and I give him what's called
			a ""trigger phrase.""
			It's essentially training the brain
			to behave a certain way
			every time he hears it.
			You can do that?
			Just kind of make me zone out during?
			That's the idea, yeah.
			Whenever you hear the trigger phrase,
			you just imagine yourself
			sitting on a beach,
			eating an ice cream cone.
			I don't hate that.
			Go ahead and close your eyes for me.
			Try to relax.

			Well, it was date night

			I put on some Teddy Pendergrass,

			No, sir.

			Did you make any changes to my schedule?
			No. Oh, you know what?
			Yeah, I added a new rule for safety.
			The guys were slapping the back
			of the truck two times
			when it was all loaded up,
			but then Smitty got his foot run over,
			so now I told 'em to do
			200 slaps, just to be safe.

			I can't tell, we got, like,
			six other slappers going.
			Griffin, what's going on?
			All of our weekly shipments
			are late, again.
			Mr. Lloyd, I think
			we can get back on track
			if we just optimize our load outs.
			See, back in my mailman days,
			we would pre-sort our deliveries
			by destination.
			If we bundle the inventory by invoice
			rather than by product type,
			it'll expedite the delivery
			out on the road.
			My goodness, why haven't we
			been doing that all along?
			Cleveland, you've proven yourself
			invaluable to this organization.
			I'm hereby promoting you to
			Vice Executive Managing Director

			Wow, thank you, sir.
			Hey, good for you, Cleveland.
			Good for all of us.
			Good for this department.
			And as for you, Griffin,
			I need you to clear your things
			out of your office.
			Cleveland is going to need more room
			to perform his managerial duties.
			Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute,
			you're kicking me out
			of my own office? (CHUCKLES)
			You're not, uh, you're not
			replacing me, are you?
			Oh, no, we're just doing
			a little restructuring.
			Besides, you won't need an
			office for your new assignment.
			I'm putting you in charge
			of kitchen banter.
			What you got there? Little jet fuel?
			Little java? Little jitter juice?
			I'll take a top-off, if you don't mind.
			Yeah, don't talk to me
			till I've had my coffee, right?

			Hey, how come you were
			only pregnant for four months?
			- PRESTON: Griffin.
			- Sorry, it's my first day.
			Look, I know this is awkward,

			so we don't have to stay long
			if you don't want.
			Eh, it's one night, I'll be fine.
			Wait, Peter, where's the bottle
			of wine I told you to bring?
			Cleveland makes more money

			That means we're sneaking

			We're all on the same team.
			Ah, that means yes.
			Hey, Cleveland, how about

			GUESTS: Yeah, speech, speech!
			Or maybe just cover it

			All right, all right, settle down.
			I'd like to thank y'all

			Do you think it's okay
			I used the upstairs bathroom?
			It was bad enough

			Cleveland's better than me.
			Now it's all our friends, too.
			Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.

			I'm here to check it out.

			- (PHONE BEEPS)
			Well, I'm sorry
			someone wasted your time,
			but as you can see,
			everything here is up to code.
			Have a good day.
			I found your rat in the tank
			during my rounds this morning.
			- Why'd you do it, Peter?
			- (SIGHS) I'm sorry.
			It's just, with you doing
			so well at the brewery,
			I felt like a joke.
			I knew I was never
			gonna be a big shot here,
			but I liked playing my small
			part to help make this beer.
			Before you started, that
			small part felt like enough.
			Griffin, I was just informed
			that you tried to sabotage
			this operation by putting vermin
			in the beer tank.
			This is the last straw, Griffin.
			You are fired.
			Fine. I'm not good enough
			for this place anyway.
			Wait. You can't fire Peter, sir.
			- And why's that?
			- Because you need him.
			Sure, companies need some people
			to work hard
			and go the extra mile,
			but more than that,
			they need guys like Peter,
			regular guys who are happy
			to do a thankless job
			for a mediocre salary,
			day in and day out,
			so long as that day ends
			with a cold beer
			and a best friend to share it with.
			If you fire Peter Griffin,
			sir, you fire your customer,
			the beer-loving everyman
			that makes up the hunched
			backbone of this country.
			Cleveland, you're right.
			Griffin here is perfectly mediocre,
			and America runs on mediocre.
			You know, that's the kind of insight
			I need coming from up top.
			How'd you like to join me
			on the executive floor?
			I appreciate the offer, sir,
			but I can't accept.
			In fact, I'm officially
			""terndering"" my resignation,
			and recommending Peter Griffin
			as my replacement.
			There's only one job I was born to do,
			- and I'm gonna go get it ba

			There's the bird with my laptop!
			POSTMASTER: Just come in.
			Thank you for seeing me, sir.

			and I'm here to get my job back.
			- Well, that's great, but
			- Please, sir, let me finish.
			With this rubber band, I will
			cinch the offending testicle
			so that it can never dangle nor
			sway where it does not belong.
			(DEEP BREATH) Here I go.
			- (GRUNTING)
			- (RUBBER BAND SNAPS)
			It's done.
			Cleveland, we sent your
			reinstatement forms a week ago.
			I never check my own mail.
			You know how Pablo Escobar
			never did cocaine?
			- He did a lot of cocaine.
			- Oh.
			Then I fear I've made
			a terrible mistake.
			Turns out, we couldn't fire you
			without running it by the union head.
			Welcome back, Cleveland.
			(LAUGHS HEARTILY)
			Thank you, sir. It's good to be back.
			- (RUBBER BAND SNAPS)
			- (BOUNCING)
			And there goes my ball.
			- Here's your rubber band back.

			Oh, yeah.
			Yep, sure is nice

			Say, Cleveland, how about
			you and me get a quick selfie

			- I guess.
			Okay, great.
			Can you sign this form
			for my Mom Meeting,
			acknowledging your merriment?
			Wow, very good.
			I see everyone had a good time.
			Would you like to spin
			the wheel of Mom Prizes?
			""Donate spin to mom
			you wish to belittle.""
			Oh, thank you! But, you know,
			Bonnie needs this more than I do.
			Her rejuvenation only made things worse.
			Holography? That's
			next door to witchcraft,
			and down the hall from David-Blaine-ery.
			I do not care for his ruses.
			Ah, stop being such a wuss. Let's go.
			The Michael Cera hologram
			is a weird choice.
			Oh, i-it's the real me.
			I'm just kind of translucent.
			Oh, hello, Hollywood.
			Yes, I would like to star
			in an action movie franchise.
			That's not a Bluetooth.
			He just stuck a Tootsie Roll in his ear.
			Wow, these holograms are
			the most amazing thing
			I've ever seen, and I've seen,
			like, a really big horse.
			Welcome to my hologram laboratory.
			Would you like to see
			how I make my babies?
			I mean, I'm already here.
			Is that a yes?
			- Yes.
			- Just say that, then.
			This machine scans your data,
			then creates a virtual
			hard light version of you
			that can physically interact
			with the world.
			That sounds kind of bogus.
			Does the science check out on that?
			They used it on Star Trek.
			You got a problem with Star Trek?
			Okay, take it easy.
			I accept your explanation.
			We all should. It's Halloween.
			You can command them
			to perform any human task,
			no matter how menial.
			So, you're saying I can have something
			that looks exactly like me
			seem like it's enjoying
			spending time with its family?
			Precisely.
			- Can I have it?
			- I'm afraid not.
			It's my only one.
			Maybe there are
			other arrangements we can make?
			Boy, this is the first button-down shirt
			that looks great untucked.
			- It's an UNTUCKit.
			- What's their secret?
			Oh, they just make shirts
			a tiny bit shorter.
			Genius.
			Man, this machine is complicated.
			I hope I can figure it out.
			Here goes nothing.
			Thank you for choosing
			the Holomaker-9000.
			Please input personal characteristics.
			Do they have to be true?
			I have no way of knowing
			what is true and what is not.
			Such is life
			in the Post-Donald-Trump Era.
			Ugh, leave the satire
			to Garrison Keillor.
			Okay, time for
			some statements about myself
			that are definitely not lies.
			Let's see, I'm a black belt in karate,
			I can cook an eight-course French meal,
			I always enter cars through the window
			'cause doors ain't the boss of me,
			and I'm great at remembering names.
			Just ask my friends:
			Joel, Clemson and Quick Time.
			Hello, Peter Griffin.
			I am Hologram Peter Griffin.
			How may I be of service?
			Come upstairs, Peter!
			I need you to put
			the too-small slip covers
			on the hard-to-grip couch pillows.
			You can start by handling that.
			I would be happy to help your
			family with whatever they need.
			Aw, sweet! If this works out,
			I'll have more time
			for those QAnon rallies.
			- What do we want?
			- We don't know!
			- When do we want it?
			- Also unclear!
			- Why do we want it?
			- Because it was forwarded to us
			in an email, so it must be true!
			Yeah!
			Oh, Peter, there you are.
			Listen, I'm trying
			to clear out my closet,
			so I want you to give me your
			honest opinion of every garment.
			Perfect. I love working
			as a team to reduce clutter.
			Okay, first, my ""7 Up Yours"" T-shirt.
			That was the most provocative
			thing ever put on television
			at the time, you have to keep that.
			Okay, great.
			Now my ""Skinny Girl Margarita""
			T-shirt Bethenny Frankel gave me
			after she hit Chris with her car.
			That's a fun story. Keep.
			Great. Okay.
			Under-the-seat studio audience poncho
			from The Meredith Vieira Show?
			Maybe it's time
			to say goodbye to Miss Vieira.
			Oh, man, this is going great!
			Aw, crap, I'm stuck.
			Let me call my eye hole painting guy.
			Hey, it's Peter Griffin.
			Yep, trapped in the painting again.
			I know, I know.
			Well, can't you just look up my account?
			No, I don't have my ID number.
			No, I can't get my ID number!
			Because I'm trapped in the painting!
			I'm sorry, I-I'm mad
			at your company, not you.
			You-You're fine.
			Okay, yesterday worked out great.
			So here's some more dumb family
			stuff I want you to do for me.
			""Teach Stewie what sound the cow makes.""
			It's ""moo."" ""Quack"" is duck.
			""Get opiates from John.""
			Yeah, I'll give you John's number.
			Tell him it's Peter calling
			for opiates from John.
			- He'll know what you mean.
			- Got it.
			Now that you're doing all that,
			I'm going to The Clam with the guys.
			Oh, man, this hologram thing
			is the best idea
			since the Mayflower hired
			a cruise director.
			Okay, everyone, from 8:00 until 9:00,
			we'll be trembling before our angry God.
			From 9:00 to 10:00, there's
			yellow fever on the lido deck.
			And at 10:00, it's everybody's favorite,
			Buckle-Hat Bingo.
			What if we lost our buckle hat?
			- Well, do you have a plain hat?
			- Yeah.
			- Do you have a belt?
			- Yeah.
			You got a buckle hat.
			I just love knowing what's going on.
			Oh, Peter, thanks for clearing out
			an area for us to start a garden.
			Yeah, they say the best day
			to plant a garden is yesterday.
			And the next best day is today!
			This, this is what I meant
			about making an effort with the family.
			And I can garden, too,
			'cause I have a brown thumb.
			That's more of a wiping issue,
			son, but I'm glad you're here.
			This is great, but I'm a little hot.
			No problem, that's why
			I bought a giant sun hat
			that can fit all of us.
			And now to quote the kitchen towel,
			""Lettuce turnip the beet.""
			Stop it or I'm gonna wet myself.
			Me, too. I always wet my plants.
			Where do you get all this?
			They're all from towels, Lois!
			They're all from towels!
			Well, what do you think, guys?
			Should we wrap it up?
			Yeah, but can one of you
			throw glitter on me?
			It's-it's better if Lois thinks
			I'm at a strip club.
			She hates you guys.
			Peter, I think you're
			a little too drunk to walk home.
			- Yeah, give us your shoes.
			- Can we give you a ride?
			No, no, it's okay. I'll just black out
			and-and never know how I got home.
			Works every time.
			And it's good
			for the environment, maybe.
			Boy, they look pretty happy.
			And they're singing Halloween carols.
			Halloween has lots of candy ♪
			Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪
			Wear a mask and ring a doorbell ♪
			- The perfect rhyme!
			- Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪
			Don't be racist with your costume ♪
			Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la. ♪
			Ah, that was fun.
			And now that we're
			just about done with Halloween,
			maybe it's time to start writing
			the family Christmas letter.
			Ah, Peter, that's a great idea!
			Good luck, pal.
			Our Christmas letter always runs aground
			'cause our family has
			no accomplishments.
			All right, we need
			some highlights from our year.
			Um, I got suspended
			for setting up a tent
			in my Spanish teacher's front yard.
			""After several
			adventurous camping trips,
			""Chris is becoming
			quite the outdoors man
			and has found a true mentor
			in Señora Diaz.""
			I was trying to snag a bagel
			from the school dumpster
			and got accidentally hoisted
			into the garbage truck.
			""This was the year
			Meg caught the travel bug.""
			Stewie's first pony ride ended
			after he blew out his diaper
			all over the horse's back.
			""Stewie pooped on a horse.""
			Whoa, Pop, where's my razzle-dazzle?
			""And Lois celebrated
			her 29th birthday this year.""
			Oh, Peter.
			What the h Lois isn't 29
			Oh, I see what he's doing.
			That's-that's very funny.
			What the hell? No one kisses my wife
			except, begrudgingly, me!
			It's time for Hologram Peter to go back
			inside the machine where he came from.
			I'll be back in a minute.
			Don't pray without me.
			Give me that! You're not the only one
			who can do things for this family.
			Can you can you pick that up?
			Listen, I appreciate
			you covering for me,
			but I can take it from here.
			Don't be silly.
			I've got 'em all taken care of.
			Go have fun.
			I thought this was gonna be a good idea,
			and-and these last few hours
			have been great
			You've been gone three days.
			But I'm ready to go back to my family.
			Okay, you're the boss.
			The hologram machine is in the basement.
			Let's head down there together
			and sort this out.
			Where's the machine?
			I left it right over
			As Peter lost consciousness,
			he finally saw the folly
			of his hologram misadventure.
			Also, going forward, I'd appreciate
			a bit more warning
			before having to narrate.
			Even just a few minutes
			to finish whatever it is I'm doing.
			Sir, you're supposed
			to buy something
			if you want to use the restroom.
			Well, what's the cheapest thing you got?
			Probably a near-the-register cookie?
			Well, put me down for one of those.
			Wha what happened?
			- I knocked you out and tied you up.
			- Why?
			Because they're my family now.
			Well, the joke's on you.
			When you first got here,
			I sent a letter to the FBI
			because I knew something
			like this might happen.
			Is it bad?
			It's better than the last one.
			You should put it up on the FBI fridge
			next to his drawing of Shrek.
			What?
			Nothing. It's not supposed to be Shrek.
			It's supposed to be the Hulk,
			but that's funny.
			You don't deserve your family.
			I care about them way more
			than you ever did.
			That's not true!
			Oh, yeah? Who bought
			double-Decker burial plots
			because Lois likes to be on top?
			Who taught Chris to whisper ""Black""
			out of respect for ""Blacks""?
			Me! And once I finish you,
			they'll be all mine.
			Peter!
			Can you come upstairs, and tell
			me if this gray chicken smells funny?
			Be right up, babe!
			Aw, man. This is worse than
			Wait, what are we supposed
			to do in this cutaway?
			I don't know, I didn
			I didn't understand the setup.
			Well, we have to do something.
			Um, I mean, you do have
			a long neck and I have fangs.
			Maybe something in that area?
			Uh, maybe we just wait
			to hear what the grown men
			who write for cartoons say?
			Cream number 99 and cream 100.
			Okay, I'm ready for bed.
			Well, we had meatloaf tonight,
			so I guess I'm in for a Dutch oven.
			What's a Dutch oven?
			Peter, wh-why is there dental
			floss in this trash can?
			Because I just flossed.
			Death creeps in
			through the gums, you know.
			Um, Peter, I-I need to go downstairs.
			I I left a lame excuse on the stove.
			Okay, but be careful,
			I just mopped the kitchen floor.
			I love you!
			Stewie, wake up! We got to go.
			Chris, come on. We got to go.
			Meg, can you drag the trash to
			the curb tomorrow before 9:00?
			We won't be here.
			Thanks for telling us
			that whole back story
			on the way down the stairs, Mom.
			Yeah, now we don't have
			to waste time hearing about
			how a hologram of Peter
			replaced the real Peter.
			Although, I don't know
			why we had to hear about
			Bonnie not inviting you
			to Rosé Game Night.
			Well, I just thought it was
			weird, 'cause it was my idea.
			Going somewhere, family?
			I didn't want to have to tie you up.
			I did everything for you.
			And people think
			holograms don't have feelings.
			Well, we don't.
			And then I watched
			one episode of This Is Us,
			and now I'm all feelings.
			Don't mention This is Us.
			Aw, great. Now I'm gonna cry.
			Save your crocodile tears.
			None of you appreciated me.
			And if I can't have you, no one will.
			I hate This is Us.
			Let my family go.
			I'm impressed.
			How did you free yourself
			from the bindings?
			I found a hacksaw
			and sawed through my hands.
			Why didn't you saw through the ropes?
			Hacksaw hindsight is
			twenty-twenty, Lois.
			The important thing is,
			I stitched my hands back on
			with Twizzlers.
			All right, fat guy fight rules:
			We grab at each other's shirts
			until we're out of breath
			- and then a three-minute break.
			- Got it.
			Should we just take
			a three-minute break now?
			Agreed.
			It turned into a pudding break.
			Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
			I didn't get to lick the lid.
			Now for the final download.
			Everything in your mind.
			Joke's on you. There's nothing in there.
			Guys, Dad needs help!
			We have to short-circuit the hologram.
			Can anyone shoot lightning
			from their fingers?
			I can,
			but I have to be very angry.
			Wait, Brian, there are
			other kinds of electricity.
			By simply rubbing my feet on the carpet,
			I may be able to generate
			enough static electricity
			- to do the job.
			- Stewie, that's a great idea!
			What can I do to help?
			I need something to get my feet going.
			Can you sing ""I Got Rhythm""?
			Um, I-I Can I, can I just say ""da da""
			for the words I don't know?
			We have no choice. Go!
			Da da rhythm ♪
			Wait, wait, wait.
			We're starting
			with the ""da das"" already?
			You don't know ""I got rhythm""?
			It's in the name!
			Okay, I got it. Got it, got it.
			- I got da da ♪
			- Rhythm!
			You said that the first time!
			Okay, now I'm starting to get angry.
			I'll do it myself.
			I got rhythm ♪
			Da da music. ♪
			Oh-ho! The expert.
			Well, I got through the title at least.
			It's working!
			Quick, everyone, hold hands.
			We have to reach Peter.
			We can't reach him!
			Lois, use your toe!
			I haven't had a pedicure in four weeks!
			Just do it. We won't look.
			Ew.
			Peter! Touch my toe!
			- Ew.
			- Do it!
			That's usually my line, but whatever.
			Wilma!
			You saved us, Peter.
			Yeah, glad you thought of it.
			I hate this place.
			Of course I did.
			I love you guys.
			And from now on,
			I'll try to be half as good
			as Hologram Me was.
			Oh, but don't you see, Peter?
			The hologram was you.
			He was just the best version of you.
			You can get there, it'll just take work.
			No, the deal was
			I promise to be half as good
			as a fake thing.
			- All right, just do that.
			- No promises.
			Well, Peter, I'm glad you're safe,
			and everything's back to normal.
			Yeah. Me, too. And you know what?
			I realized how much I missed you guys.
			What do you say we turn off that TV
			and do something as a family?
			Damn it.

			Hey, kids, I'm Mr. Andy,
			and I just invented
			this really crazy game.
			One person hides in a top secret spot,
			and the others count to ten,
			then try and find him.
			We'll call it, oh, I don't know,
			""hide-and-seek""?
			I say, one game covering
			covert activity,
			surveillance and counting?
			I would follow this man into
			the very bowels of hell.
			All right, who wants to hide first?
			Oh, me, me.
			Looks like we have
			our first little hider.
			I'm so glad they didn't fire you
			for giving us baths.
			Okay, it's time to bid on our
			final donated item of the night:
			a romantic Vermont weekend getaway.
			(GASP) Peter, we have to win.
			Vermont is an Instagram goldmine.
			I could shatter Bonnie's record.
			Lois, we can't afford
			I'll take you to Ben & Jerry's.
			I have $600 taped to my stomach.
			$600!
			Sold. There were no other bids.
			You could have had it for $40.
			(STAMMERING)
			That concludes this scene,
			ladies and gentlemen.
			(SLIDE WHISTLE)
			Chris, what Oh, who cares?
			We're in Vermont till Sunday.
			Call if you have to
			but, like, let's not call.
			Can we only brush our teeth
			for 60 seconds
			instead of the full 90?
			You brush your teeth? Nerd.
			And remember, kids, if you get nervous,
			you can always turn on
			the home security system.
			That's right. The keypad code is 6969.
			If your mother doesn't want to do it,
			at least she can type it.
			You're a legend, Dad.
			Hey, Brian, can you find me?
			What the Is that a talking blanket?
			It's me. It's crazy, right?
			It's this brand-new game
			called hide-and-seek.
			Basically a peekaboo
			on Flintstones Vitamins.
			- Let's play
			- Fine.
			But like all adults, on my turns,
			I'll only hide in beds
			so I can take little naps.
			I'll start counting. Go upstairs.
			Whoa, I never even thought about
			hiding upstairs.
			This is a game changer, like Twitch.
			YOUTUBER: Normal voice.
			Playing Minecraft, quiet-normal.
			Loudest scream possible!
			Kinda quiet, normal-quiet, Minecraft.
			Scorching-hot audio levels!
			Oh, my God.
			Pretty cool spot, eh, Bri?
			Do all kids know what a good spot
			a closed-door refrigerator is?
			No. Don't ever hide in there.
			Could you even breathe?
			No. It's a good thing
			you were looking for me.
			Stewie, no. Very bad.
			What the hell was that?
			A spanking. That was me spanking you.
			That's it? Brian,
			you either gotta be that guy
			or-or not be that guy.
			I-I don't I don't know what that was.
			Oh, God, she did it again.
			- Who?
			- Bonnie.
			Every time I do a post,
			she does one right after.
			- So what?
			- So what?
			It undercuts my post's popularity.
			Like Armageddon and Deep Impact.
			Oh, yeah, that was weird.
			Can you imagine you just
			wrapped principle shooting
			on Volcano, and you're very proud of it,
			and then bam, here comes Dante's Peak?
			One more and I'll get it.
			You've just finished

			two ladies holding hands,
			and they just kissed goodbye,
			so I've been elsewhere.
			Wha-What were you saying?
			Y-You like movies or something?
			Ah, look at this.
			A glassblowing class.
			That kind of crap is perfect
			for Instagram.

			Oh, I'm so beat.
			Me and Rupert played H&S
			Quicker way to say hide-and-seek
			All night, until like 8:00 p. m.
			I'm not even joking. Wanna play?
			Not now. I'm trying to get
			this TED Talk onto the TV.
			I can see the PornHub logo
			reflecting on your
			big, wet dog eyes, you scumbag.
			Honestly, Stewie, I'm getting
			pretty bored of hide-and-seek.
			Oh, please, Brian,
			just one game. Please?
			(SIGHS) Okay.
			But no more hiding in the fridge,
			in the washing machine, the open safe
			with the long-forgotten combination.
			Oh, no, I'm way better now.
			I might be the best player in the world.
			Okay, I'm gonna go hide. Count to 20.
			I'll probably count to, like,
			six or seven minutes.
			Oh, baby, that's the spot.

			Oh, Amelie, Noelle,
			I have a 48-hour layover in Paris,
			and I'd love to include you

			Yeah, on me.
			That's what I was hoping for.
			Oh, this is gonna be a great weekend.
			That seems like it's happening, right?
			Your orgy? Yeah.
			Can we just talk about plane stuff?
			Ah, I forget you young guys
			don't like to talk about sex at work.
			Hey, take over for a sec.
			I gotta make sure I packed

			diminish our entire profession
			to a frat guy's Halloween costume.
			- Stewie?
			- Mr. Quagmire?
			Terrance.
			All right, we're gonna
			get you home, little guy.
			(LINE RINGING)
			Peter, is Lois there? Put me on speaker.
			Hi, Glenn. What's going on?
			Well, I just flew to Paris,
			and Stewie was somehow in my suitcase.
			He must have snuck in there.
			Oh, my God! Is he okay?
			Yeah, he's eating one of those
			weird French street ham things
			that aren't good but are also amazing.
			Look, how soon can you come get him?
			I only have 48 hours in Paris
			and a whole list of
			horny activities to do.
			Okay, let me just do the math.
			In 48 hours we'd need to
			get to an airport,
			which we're hours from,
			find a last-minute flight
			If there are any
			Fly ten hours, then wait for Peter's
			post-flight airport poop
			Peter don't poop on planes.
			Or we leave him in the care
			of a trusted adult
			and one of our best friends
			and enjoy the first trip
			we've had together in years.
			Lois, uh, shouldn't we go?
			(SIGHS) Okay, if you think that

			- Ah! I got another like.
			Peter, listen, Stewie is safe,
			we're in the prettiest place
			we'll ever be

			Quags, you got this, right?
			- Captain Quagmire, the Quags
			- Stop! I can't believe this.
			(SIGHS SHARPLY) Okay, I'll watch him.
			But I'm not happy, Peter.
			Oh, and now that you're my babysitter,
			I'd rather you call me Mr. Griffin.
